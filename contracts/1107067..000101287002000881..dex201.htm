 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of February 17, 2002
by and between CIENA CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("CIENA") and ONI
SYSTEMS CORP., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").



RECITALS



WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of CIENA and the Company have
determined that the merger of the Company with and into CIENA (the "Merger")
in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as
amended (the "DGCL"), and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, is advisable and in the best interests of CIENA and the Company
and their respective stockholders;



WHEREAS, in order to induce CIENA to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently herewith each director and executive officer of the Company and
their controlled affiliates are entering into stockholder agreements with
CIENA in the form of Exhibit A (the "Stockholder Agreements"), pursuant to
which, among other things, each such stockholder agrees to vote in favor of
this Agreement and the Merger and against any competing proposals and each
director and executive officer of the Company are entering into letter
agreements with CIENA in the form of Exhibit B (the "Affiliate Letters"); and



WHEREAS, the parties intend that, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto intending to be legally bound do
hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER 



SECTION 1.1. General.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance
with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (i) the Company shall be merged with and
into CIENA, (ii) the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease
and (iii) CIENA shall be the surviving company (the "Surviving Company") and
shall continue its legal existence under the laws of the State of Delaware.



(b) The Merger shall become effective at the time of filing of a
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the provisions of Section 251 of the DGCL, or at such later
time as may be stated

 

1  in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). The closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Hogan and Hartson,
L.L.P., 111 South Calvert Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202 at 10:00 A.M.,
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VI, and two Business Days after the date on which the last of the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(b), 6.1(d) and 6.2(c) shall have been
satisfied or waived, or on such other date, time and place as the Company and
CIENA may mutually agree (the "Closing Date").



(c) At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company shall vest in the
Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, and duties of the
Company shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if prior to
the time of effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement referred to in
Section 5.5 below, the Company reasonably in good faith determines, after
consultation with CIENA and after having exercised its reasonable best efforts
to obtain required consents, that obtaining required consents to the
assignment of those material contracts, leases or agreements set forth
on Schedule 6.2(c) would not be practicable prior to the anticipated
Effective Time, and as a result the Companys ability to satisfy the closing
condition set forth in Section 6.2(c) would be materially impaired, the Merger
will (unless CIENA agrees at such time to waive the closing condition in
Section 6.2(c)) alternatively be structured so that a wholly-owned subsidiary
of CIENA which will be a corporation formed under the laws of the State of
Delaware ("Merger Sub"), will merge into Company in a reverse triangular
merger intended to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.
No change in structure shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the
Merger Consideration or the tax-free treatment of the Merger, (ii) materially
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (iii) materially and adversely affect the ability of any party to
timely perform its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such change in
structure is made, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to
this Agreement and any other documents necessary in order to reflect such
election and its consequences to the structure of the Merger.



SECTION 1.2. Certificate of Incorporation. 



The Certificate of Incorporation of CIENA, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the "CIENA Certificate"), shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as provided
therein and by law.



SECTION 1.3. The By-Laws.



The By-laws of CIENA, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as
provided therein and by law.

 

2 SECTION 1.4. Board of Directors and Officers.



From and after the Effective Time, the Board of Directors and Officers of
CIENA at the Effective Time shall continue as the Board of Directors
and Officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold office until his or her
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



SECTION 1.5. Conversion of Securities.



At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Company or the holders of the Companys common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (the "Company Common Stock"):



(a) Each issued and outstanding share of CIENA capital stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and unaffected as issued
and outstanding shares of the Surviving Company;



(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company
and each share of Company Common Stock owned by CIENA shall be canceled
without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto; and



(c) At the Effective Time, each then issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for the
right to receive consideration (the "Merger Consideration"), consisting of
0.7104 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the common stock, par value $0.01 per
share of CIENA (the "CIENA Common Stock").



All references in this Agreement to CIENA Common Stock to be received in
accordance with the Merger shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to include the corresponding fraction of a right ("Right") to purchase
shares of series A junior participating preferred stock, par value $.01 per
share, pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of December 29, 1997 between
CIENA and Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. (formerly Bank of Boston, N.A.) as
amended by the First Amendment to Rights Agreement dated as of June 2, 1998,
the Second Amendment to Rights Agreement dated as of September 13, 1998, and
the Third Amendment to Rights Agreement dated as of October 19, 1998 (the
"Rights Agreement"). After the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than (i) the right to
receive shares of CIENA Common Stock to be issued in consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such certificate, (ii) any dividends and other
distributions in accordance with Section 1.8(c) and (iii) any cash, without
interest, to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of CIENA Common Stock in
accordance with Section 1.9.



SECTION 1.6. Adjustment of the Exchange Ratio.



In the event that, prior to the Effective Date, any stock split, combination,
reclassification or stock dividend with respect to the CIENA Common Stock, any
change or conversion of CIENA Common

 

3  Stock into other securities or any other dividend or distribution with
respect to the CIENA Common Stock should occur or, if a record date with
respect to any of the foregoing should occur, appropriate and proportionate
adjustments shall be made to the Exchange Ratio, and thereafter all references
to the Exchange Ratio shall be deemed to be to such Exchange Ratio as so
adjusted.



 

SECTION 1.7. Exchange Procedures; Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged
Shares; Stock Transfer Books.



(a) As of the Effective Time, CIENA shall deposit with the Exchange Agent
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
certificates representing the shares of the CIENA Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.5(c) in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock
and if applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
1.8. (Such shares of CIENA Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Sections 1.7(c) and 1.8, and
such cash are referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund").



(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, CIENA shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a
holder of record of certificates which represented outstanding Company Common
Stock (the "Certificates") which shares were converted into the right to
receive CIENA Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5, a letter of transmittal
which (i) shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and
title to such Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery thereof to
the Exchange Agent and (ii) shall contain instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
Certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal duly
executed, such holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of CIENA Common Stock
into which the Company Common Stock represented by the surrendered Certificate
shall have been converted at the Effective Time (B) cash in lieu of any
fractional share of CIENA Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.8 and (C)
certain dividends and distributions in accordance with Section 1.7(c), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall then be canceled. Subject to Section 1.7(c)
and Section 1.8, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b),
each Certificate, from and after the Effective Time, shall be deemed to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the number of shares
of CIENA Common Stock into which such Company Common Stock shall have been
converted.



(c) No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to the CIENA Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to any holder entitled by reason of the Merger to
receive certificates representing CIENA Common Stock and no cash payment in
lieu of a fractional share of CIENA Common Stock shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 1.8 until such holder shall have surrendered its
Certificates pursuant to this Section 1.7. Subject to applicable law,
following surrender of any such Certificate, such holder shall be paid, in
each case, without interest, (i) the amount of any dividends or other
distributions theretofore paid with respect to the shares of CIENA

 

4  Common Stock represented by the certificate received by such holder and
having a record date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date prior
to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as
practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such shares of CIENA Common Stock and having a record
date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment
date on or after such surrender.



(d) If any certificate representing shares of CIENA Common Stock or any
cash is to be issued or paid to any Person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to
such exchange that such surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and such Person either (i) shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of the
issuance of such certificates of CIENA Common Stock and the distribution of
such cash payment to such Person or (ii) shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. CIENA or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as CIENA or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by CIENA or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by CIENA or
the Exchange Agent. All amounts in respect of taxes received or withheld by
CIENA shall be disposed of by CIENA in accordance with the Code or such state,
local or foreign tax law, as applicable.



(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and subject to such other conditions as the Board
of Directors of CIENA may impose. CIENA shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of CIENA Common Stock as
determined under Section 1.5(c) and pay any cash, dividends and distributions
as determined in accordance with Section 1.7(c) and Section 1.8 in respect of
such Certificate. When authorizing such issue of shares of CIENA Common Stock
(and payment of any such cash, dividends and distribution) in exchange for
such Certificate, the Board of Directors of CIENA (or any authorized officer
thereof) may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to give CIENA a bond in such sum as the Board of Directors may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against CIENA with
respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



(f) At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law.

 

5 (g) Holders of unsurrendered Certificates who were the registered holders
at the effective Time shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at
any meeting of CIENA stockholders the number of whole shares of CIENA Common
Stock represented by such Certificates, regardless of whether such holders
have exchanged their Certificates.



SECTION 1.8. No Fractional Shares.



 

No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of CIENA Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such a
fractional share shall not entitle the record or beneficial owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights as a stockholder of CIENA. In lieu of receiving
any such fractional share, each holder of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise have been entitled thereto upon the surrender of Certificates for
exchange will receive cash (without interest) in an amount rounded to the
nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying (i) the per share closing price
on NASDAQ of CIENA Common Stock on the date on which the Effective Time shall
occur (or, if the CIENA Common Stock shall not trade on NASDAQ on such date,
the first day of trading in CIENA Common Stock on NASDAQ thereafter) by (ii)
the fractional share to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. CIENA
shall make available to the Exchange Agent the cash necessary for this
purpose.



SECTION 1.9. Return of Exchange Fund. 



Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Common Stock for six months after the Effective Date shall
be delivered to CIENA, upon its request, and any such former holders who have
not theretofore surrendered to the Exchange Agent their Certificates in
compliance herewith shall thereafter look only to CIENA for payment of their
claim for shares of CIENA Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of CIENA Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to such
shares of CIENA Common Stock. Neither CIENA nor the Company shall be liable to
any former holder of Company Common Stock for any such shares of CIENA Common
Stock held in the Exchange Fund (and any cash, dividends and distributions
payable in respect thereof) which is delivered to a public official pursuant
to an official request under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.



SECTION 1.10. No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.



All shares of CIENA Common Stock delivered upon the surrender for exchange of
any Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to Section 1.7, Section 1.8 or Section 1.9) shall be deemed to have
been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate.

 

6 SECTION 1.11. Further Assurances.



 

If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Company shall consider
or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any
other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect
or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Company, its right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
properties or Assets of the Company or (b) otherwise to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Company and its proper officers and
directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company,
all such other acts and things necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect
or confirm its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties or Assets of the Company and
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.



SECTION 1.12. Appraisal Rights



In accordance with Section 262(b) of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall
be available to holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the
Merger.



ARTICLE II

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



The Company hereby represents and warrants to CIENA as follows:



SECTION 2.1. Organization and Qualification.



 

The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Delaware and each of its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization. Each
of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and to perform the
terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as
disclosed on Schedule 2.1, each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified to conduct its business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of its Assets or the nature of
its activities in connection with the conduct of its business makes such
qualification necessary or in which the failure to be so qualified and in good
standing would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company does not
directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar
interest in, any Person other than its Subsidiaries, except as set forth on
Schedule 2.1.

 

7 SECTION 2.2. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.



The Company has heretofore delivered or made available to CIENA a complete and
correct copy of the Company Certificate and the bylaws of the Company, each
as amended to date. Such Company Certificate and bylaws are in full force and
effect. The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the
Company Certificate or its bylaws. The Company has heretofore delivered or
made available to CIENA a complete and correct copy of each Subsidiaries
charter and bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, each as amended to
and as in effect as of the date hereof.



SECTION 2.3. Capitalization.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 700,000,000
shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of which 141,458,654

third party. The Company or a Subsidiary is the holder of all the leasehold
estates purported to be granted to such entity by the leases listed in
Schedule 2.9 and is the owner of all equipment, machinery and other Assets
purported to be owned by the Company or a Subsidiary thereon, free and clear
of all Encumbrances. Each such lease and other agreement is in full force and
effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of, and is
legally enforceable against, the respective parties thereto (except as such

registrations therefor have been made, and to the Companys Knowledge, there
have been no threatened cancellations thereof and are no outstanding disputes

material respects all obligations thereunder required to be performed by such
entity to date. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default in any
material respect under any of the foregoing and to the Companys Knowledge,
no other party is in default in any material respect under any of the
foregoing, and there has not occurred any event which (whether with or without
notice, lapse of time or the happening or occurrence of any other event)
would, constitute a default on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary, or
to the Companys Knowledge, a party other than the Company.

12  Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any other party is in breach of or in default under
any such Contract except for such breaches and defaults as individually or in

16  payable by it, and there are no agreements, waivers or other arrangements
providing for an extension of time with respect to the payment of any Tax;
(ii) received no written notice of, nor does the Company have any Knowledge
of, any notice of deficiency or assessment or proposed deficiency or
assessment from any taxing Government Entity; (iii) no Knowledge of any audits
pending and there are no outstanding agreements or waivers by the Company or
any Subsidiary that extend the statutory period of limitations applicable to
any federal, state, local, or foreign tax returns or Taxes; and (iv) not
entered into any discussions with any federal, state, local, or foreign

of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have never been audited by
federal, state, local, or foreign authorities. There are no Liens on any
property of the Company or any Subsidiary that arose in connection with any
failure (or alleged failure) to pay any material Tax when due. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries has withheld from each payment made to any of its
past or present employees, officers or directors, and to any non-residents,
the amount of Taxes and other deductions required to be withheld therefrom and
has paid the same (or set aside for timely payment) to the proper Tax or other
receiving officers within the time required under applicable Laws. The
Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (i) did not, as of the most
recent Company Report that included financial statements exceed the reserve
for Tax Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth in the most
recent Company Report (rather than any notes thereto) and (ii) do not exceed
that reserve as adjusted for the passing of time through the Effective Time.



SECTION 2.17. Employment and Benefit Matters.



(a) _Pension and Benefit Plans and Other Arrangements_. Schedule
2.17(a) lists each employee benefit plan, program, arrangement and contract
(including, without limitation, any "employee benefit plan" as defined by
Section 3(3) of ERISA), and any benefit program or policy providing for
bonuses, incentive compensation, vacation pay, severance pay, insurance
restricted stock, stock options, employee discounts, company cars, tuition
reimbursement or any other perquisite or benefit (including, without
limitation, any fringe benefit under Section 132 of the Code), applicable to
current or former employees or individual consultants of the Company and each
Subsidiary to which it has contributed or under which it has any material
liability (collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans"). The Company has
delivered or made available to CIENA, to the extent they exist, a true and
correct copy of (i) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500 series)
filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan or similar report of the jurisdiction in which such
employee benefit plan is located, (ii) each such Company Benefit Plan
document, (iii) each trust agreement or other funding vehicle relating to each
such Company Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recent summary plan description for
each Company Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required,
and (v) the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or similar
report of the jurisdiction in which such employee benefit plan is located. No
Company Benefit Plan is or has ever been a "defined benefit plan" (as such
term is defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA), a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary
Association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code) or an
employee stock ownership plan (within the

 

17  meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code). No Company Benefit Plan is a
"multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. No
Company Benefit Plan provides for post-retirement medical or life insurance
to current, former or retired employees of the Company (other than legally
required health care continuation coverage). All Company Benefit Plans subject
to the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America or
one of its political subdivisions comply with, and have been administered in
compliance with, the Laws of such foreign jurisdiction.



(b) _Compliance_. Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.17(b), the Company
and each Subsidiary has complied, in all material respects, with all
applicable provisions of the Company Benefit Plans and the Code, ERISA, the
National Labor Relations Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN Act"), the Americans
with Disabilities Act, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and all other
Laws pertaining to the Company Benefit Plans or relations with employees, and
other employee or employment related benefits, and all premiums and
assessments relating to all Company Benefit Plans. To the Companys Knowledge,
all Company Benefit Plans that are subject to Section 4980B(f) of the Code and

Board of Directors at any time prior to the time the Merger has been approved
by the Companys stockholders from: (a) furnishing information in response to
an unsolicited request therefor by a Person who has delivered to the Board of
Directors of the Company an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal

favorable to the Company and (ii) no less restrictive on the Person requesting
such information than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; or

adviser) that the Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable to the Companys stockholders (with
respect to financial terms and, if applicable, taking into account the
strategic benefit and long-term value to stockholders of both the Merger
Consideration in the proposed Merger and the consideration offered in the
Acquisition Proposal) than the Merger (any Acquisition Proposal as to which
such determinations are made being referred to in this Agreement as a
"Superior Proposal") and (z) the Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after receiving advice of outside legal counsel that taking such action is
required or necessary in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing,
it is understood that any violation, of which the Company or any of its
Affiliates had Knowledge at the time of such violation, of the restrictions

an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement or an
agreement providing solely for the advance of funds to pay the termination
fee and expenses provided for in Section 7.5) during the term of this

course of business). The Company will, and except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, will cause its Affiliates to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the
date of this Agreement with any Persons (other than CIENA and its
representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and will not pursue, directly or indirectly, any Acquisition
Proposal received on or prior to the date of this Agreement from any Person
(other than CIENA and its representatives). The Company shall not release any

in effect on the date hereof (each, a "Stock Plan") shall together with each
such Stock Plan, be assumed by CIENA and shall thereby be converted into an
option (an "Assumed Option") to purchase the number of shares of CIENA Common
Stock (decreased to the nearest full share) determined by multiplying (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. The
exercise price of each Company Stock Option shall also be adjusted by
dividing and rounding up to the nearest whole cent (i) the exercise price for
each share otherwise purchasable pursuant to each Company Option by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio. Except for the foregoing adjustments and the Rights, all the
terms and conditions in effect for each Assumed Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall continue in effect following the assumption of such
option in accordance with this Agreement. The Company agrees that it will not
grant any stock appreciation rights or limited stock appreciation rights and
will not permit cash payments to holders of Company Stock Options in lieu of
the substitution therefor of Assumed Options. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to assure that no acceleration of vesting of Assumed
Options shall occur solely as a result of the Merger, except for the
acceleration of options described on Schedule 5.9.



(b) It is the intention of the parties that the Company Stock Options so
assumed by CIENA shall qualify, immediately after the Effective Time, as
"Incentive Stock Options" under Section 422 of the Code to the same extent
those options qualified as such Incentive Stock Options immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Accordingly, the adjustments provided herein with respect
to any Company Stock Options that are Incentive Stock Options shall be and
are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code.



(c) CIENA shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of CIENA Common Stock for delivery upon
the exercise of the Assumed Options. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, CIENA shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options
appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to such
Assumed Options and that such Assumed Options shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions as the

 

40 Company Stock Options and the applicable Stock Plan (subject to the adjustment
set forth in this Section 5.9).



(d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, CIENA shall prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S8 (or another
appropriate form) registering a number of shares subject to the Assumed
Options. Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current
status of the prospectus required thereby hall be maintained in
accordance with the relevant requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act) at least for so long as any Assumed Options remain outstanding.



(e) Concurrent with the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase Company
Common Stock that is then outstanding and exercisable described in Schedule
2.3 (each, a "Company Warrant"), without any action on the part of the
holder, shall be deemed assumed by CIENA and shall constitute a warrant to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Warrant, a number of shares of CIENA Common Stock (decreased to the
nearest whole share) calculated by multiplying (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, and exercisable at a price per
share of CIENA Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
the exercise price per share pursuant to such Company Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall make all arrangements necessary to be made
prior to the Effective Time with respect to the Company Warrants to permit the
assumption of the unexercised Company Warrants by CIENA pursuant to this
Section 5.9(e). 



(f) Concurrent with the Effective Time, CIENA shall execute and deliver to
the Trustee under the Notes one or more supplemental indentures as may be
required under the Indenture under which the Notes are issued in order, among
other things, to provide for the assumption of the Notes by CIENA and the
convertibility of the Notes into CIENA Common Stock, in accordance with the
terms thereof.



(g) In the event that the Closing Date occurs on or prior to May 20,
2002, then in respect of any options which the Company was committed to issue
to certain employees under the terms of its Offer to Exchange dated October
19, 2001 (the "Offer to Exchange"), CIENA will issue to the
relevant employees who are continuously employed by the Company and CIENA
through the relevant grant date CIENA options (the "CIENA Replacement
Options") in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer to Exchange
in replacement for options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that
were tendered by employees who accepted the Offer to Exchange. The number of
shares of CIENA Common Stock subject to each CIENA Replacement Option shall
equal (rounded down to the nearest whole share) the product of (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the cancelled option to which the
CIENA Replacement Option relates and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, subject to
adjustment for any split, recapitalization, or similar event. The exercise
price of each CIENA Replacement Option shall be the fair market value of the
CIENA Common Stock on the date of grant of the CIENA Replacement Option.

 

41 (h) Each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP (each, an "Assumed
Purchase Right") shall be assumed by CIENA. Each Assumed Purchase Right shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the terms and conditions set forth in the
ESPP and the documents governing the Assumed Purchase Rights, except that the
number of shares of CIENA Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof shall
equal the number of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise issuable upon
exercise thereof multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and the purchase price of
such shares of CIENA Common Stock on the Purchase Date (as defined in the
ESPP) shall be the lower of (i) the quotient determined by dividing 85% of the
fair market value per share of the Company Common Stock on the Offering Date
(as defined in the ESPP) for such Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) by
the Exchange Ratio and (ii) 85% of the fair marked value per share of CIENA
Common Stock on the applicable Purchase Date (with the number of shares
rounded down to the nearest whole share and the purchase price rounded up to
the nearest whole cent).



(i) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and CIENA shall confer and work together in good faith to agree upon
mutually acceptable employee benefit and compensation arrangements.



(j) To the extent that officers, directors and 10% stockholders of the
Company who are currently required to report their beneficial ownership of
equity securities of the Company pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
will be required in the judgment of CIENAs Board of Directors to report their
beneficial ownership of equity securities of CIENA following the Effective
Date under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the Board of Directors of CIENA
will adopt resolutions prior to the consummation of the Merger providing that
the receipt of CIENA equity securities from CIENA as a consequence of the
Merger and the related transactions contemplated hereby are intended to
be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and
that the approval is intended to grant the exemption from Section 16(b)
provided by Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act.



 

(k) If the Closing Date occurs prior to May 20, 2002, on the date on which
CIENA grants the CIENA Replacement Options, CIENA shall issue options to
purchase CIENA Common Stock to each individual listed on Schedule 5.9(k) (the
"Overseas Options") and subject to the terms and conditions described on
Schedule 5.9(k), provided that such individual has been continuously employed
by the Company through the Closing Date.



SECTION 5.10. Notification of Certain Matters.



The Company shall give prompt notice to CIENA, and CIENA shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of the occurrence of any event which would be
likely to cause (i) any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) any
covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement not to be
complied with or satisfied; or (iii) any failure of the Company or CIENA, as
the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

 

42 SECTION 5.11. Reorganization.



Each of CIENA and the Company adopts this Agreement as a tax-free plan of
reorganization and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
business combination to be effected by the Merger to be qualified as a
"reorganization" described in Section 368(a) of the Code. CIENA shall take no
action following the Effective Time that would have the effect of causing the
Merger to fail to so qualify.

 



SECTION 5.12. Indemnification.



From and after the Effective Time for a period of six years, CIENA shall
fulfill the obligations of the Company to indemnify each person who is or was
a director or officer of the Company against losses such person may incur
based upon matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time pursuant
to any applicable indemnification agreements and any indemnification provision
of the Company Certificate or its bylaws as each is in effect on the date
hereof. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, CIENA will cause
the Surviving Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in
effect, if available, directors and officers liability insurance covering
those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policy on terms comparable to those applicable
to the current directors and officers of the Company, provided that CIENA
shall not be required to pay an annual premium therefor in excess of 200% of
the last annual premium paid for the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance prior to the date of this Agreement but shall, in such
event, maintain such coverage as can be purchased for such amount.



SECTION 5.13. Actions by the Parties.



 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable law and regulations to consummate and
make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions and non-actions, waivers and consents, if any, from any governmental
agency or authority and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by any
governmental agency or authority; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from any other Person; (iii) the defending of
any claim, investigation, action, suit or other legal proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) the execution of additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party will promptly consult with the other and provide
necessary information (including copies thereof) with respect to all filings
made by such party with the any agency or authority in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

stockholders that is then publicly known or shall have publicly announced an
intention to make a CIENA Acquisition Proposal with respect to CIENA or any of
its Subsidiaries, (but, in the case of a termination if there has been no
Change in CIENA Board Recommendation, only if such CIENA Acquisition Proposal

or dispose of, and/or holds stock options, warrants or convertible securities
to acquire (whether or not vested) that number and class of shares of Company

of Company Capital Stock so owned of record or beneficially, together with any
other shares of capital stock of the Company acquired by such Stockholder
after the date hereof and during the term of this Agreement, being
collectively referred to herein as the "Subject Shares"); and



WHEREAS, as a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger

each of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;



(b) At any meeting of stockholders of the Company or at any adjournment
thereof or in any other circumstances upon which the Stockholders vote,
consent or other approval is sought, the Stockholder shall vote (or cause to
be voted) the Subject Shares against any proposal or any amendment of the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, which proposal or amendment

63 manner impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the Merger, the Merger Agreement
or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
change in any manner the voting rights of any class of capital stock of the
Company, and the Stockholder further agrees not to vote (or cause to be voted)
the Subject Shares in favor of any proposal to approve any transaction that

organizations qualified under Section 501I(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of

Stockholder to a third party as collateral for a loan, so long as the

the terms of this Agreement. The foregoing number of shares shall be
appropriately adjusted if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction.



(d) The Stockholder shall not, nor shall the Stockholder permit any
affiliate, director, officer, employee, investment banker, attorney or other
advisor or representative of the Stockholder to, (i) directly or indirectly

65 breach of this Agreement, CIENA, in addition to any other remedies at law or

67 Exhibit B: Affiliate Letter



 , 2002 

CIENA Corporation

1201 Winterson Road

Linthicum, Maryland 21090



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of ONI Systems Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of February , 2002 (the "Merger
Agreement") among CIENA Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("CIENA") and the
Company, the Company will enter into a business combination with CIENA or one
of its subsidiaries (the "Merger"). Capitalized terms used in this letter
without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger
Agreement.



As a result of the Merger, I will receive shares of Common Stock, $.01 par
value, of CIENA (the "CIENA Shares") in exchange for shares of capital stock
of the Company (the "Company Shares") owned by me or purchasable upon exercise
of stock options, warrants or convertible securities.



1. I represent, warrant and covenant to CIENA that in the event I receive any CIENA Shares as a result of the Merger: 



A. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and
discussed the requirements of such documents and other applicable limitations
upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the CIENA Shares, to
the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for the Company.



B. I have been advised that the issuance of the CIENA Shares to me pursuant
to the Merger has been or will be registered with the Commission under the
Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised
that, because at the time the Merger is submitted for a vote of the
stockholders of the Company, (a) I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the
Company and (b) the sale, transfer or other disposition by me of the CIENA
Shares will not have been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer
or otherwise dispose of the CIENA Shares issued to me in the Merger unless
(i) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the
volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under
the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other

 

68  disposition has been registered under the Act or (iii) in the opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to CIENA, such sale, transfer or other
disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.



C. I understand that CIENA is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of the CIENA Shares by me or on my behalf under
the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with
an exemption from such registration available.



D. I also understand that there will be placed on the certificates for the
CIENA Shares issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance: 



"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE
SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND CIENA,
A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF CIENA." 



E. I also understand that unless a sale or transfer is made in conformity
with the provisions of Rule 145, or pursuant to a registration statement,
CIENA reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates
issued to my transferee:



"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH
SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW
TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE
MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE

 

69  





REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."



F. Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my
part that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first
paragraph of this letter, nor as a waiver of any rights I may have to object
to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.



2. By CIENAs acceptance of this letter, CIENA hereby agrees with me that certificates with the legends set forth in paragraphs 1(E) and (F) above will be substituted by delivery of certificates without such legend if (i) one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the CIENA Shares received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then available to the undersigned, (ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the CIENA Shares received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable to the undersigned, or (iii) CIENA has received an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to CIENA to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Act no longer apply to the undersigned. 



    

Very truly yours, 

---
