ARTICLE II 

   

 _THE MERGER_   

  

 Section 2.1 _Capitalization of Holsum Holdings; Agreement to Merge_. 

  

 (a) _Capitalization of Holsum Holdings_. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Shareholders will contribute all of the outstanding capital stock of the Acquired Company to Holsum Holdings in exchange for capital stock of Holsum Holdings, with the Shareholders acquiring the same number of shares of Holsum Holdings as they owned in the Acquired Company, which will result in the Acquired Company being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holsum Holdings. 

   

 (b) _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of Arizona, the parties to this Agreement agree to effect the merger of Holsum Holdings with and into the Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "), with the Merger Sub as the surviving entity in the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ "), which will result in the Acquired Company being a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Surviving Entity and Fast Food Services being a second tier wholly-owned subsidiary of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (c) _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger in substantially the form of  _Exhibit A_ (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the Arizona Corporation Commission, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Arizona Corporation Code (" _ACC_ ") and the 

    ##### 

  

    

Arizona Limited Liability Company Act on the Closing Date. The Merger will
become effective upon such filing or at such time thereafter as is provided
in the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 (d) _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in the ACC and the Arizona Limited Liability Company Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Holsum Holdings and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Holsum Holdings and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (e) _Reporting of Merger_. Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, report the Merger for all Tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and shall take all actions consistent with the treatment of the Merger. 

   

 Section 2.2 _Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) _Calculation of Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Stock then issued and outstanding shall cease to exist and automatically be converted into the right to receive, without duplication: 

   

 (i) an amount of cash equal to (1) (A) $145,000,000 (i) less the Holsum Obligations, (ii) plus the Holsum Special Obligations Tax Benefit Amount, (iii) plus the SAR Plan Interest Benefit Amount, multiplied by (B) 0.5 (the " _Primary Cash Consideration_ ") _plus_ (2) the Special Cash Consideration, if applicable, _minus_ (3) $1,500,000 (collectively, the " _Cash Consideration_ "); and 

  

 (ii) the number of shares of Purchaser Stock equal to the Primary Cash Consideration divided by the Average Price; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Average Price is less than $21.00 per share (the " _Minimum Price_ "), then the Shareholders shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of Purchaser Stock equal to the Primary Cash Consideration divided by the Minimum Price plus an amount in cash (the " _Special Cash Consideration_ ") derived from the following formula: 

 

       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
    

Primary Cash Consideration

  |   |   |   |   |   | { _Primary Cash Consideration_ X Average
Price }  
  

  |   |   |   |   |   | Minimum Price   
   

   

 (iii) Subject to _Section 2.2(f)_, if, prior to the Closing, the Representative notifies the Purchaser that, in the judgment of Representatives tax advisors, the amount of the Special Cash Consideration would jeopardize the tax free nature of the Merger, the amount of the Special Cash Consideration will be reduced by an amount as agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Representative after consultation with their respective tax advisors to preserve the tax free nature of the Merger (the " _Reduction Amount_ "). The shares of Purchaser Stock into which the shares of Company Stock are converted pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_ are referred to in this Agreement as the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, collectively with the Cash Consideration, 

   ##### 

  

 

are referred to in this Agreement as the " _Merger Consideration._ " _Schedule
2.2(a)_ illustrates the operation of this _Section 2.2(a)_. 

   

 (b) The Merger Consideration shall be allocated among the Shareholders in the manner set forth in _Schedule 2.2(b)_; provided that the Cash Consideration payable to each Shareholder other than the Eisele Trust will first be allocated to the repayment of the promissory note payable by such Shareholder to the Eisele Trust, as provided in _Schedule 2.2(b)_, which amounts shall be updated as of the Closing, and paid to the Eisele Trust. All treasury shares of Holsum Holdings, if any, shall be cancelled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, all outstanding membership interests of the Merger Sub shall remain outstanding and be unaffected by the transactions described herein. 

   

 (c) _Escrow_. The parties hereto agree to enter at the Closing into an escrow agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Purchaser shall deliver Cash Consideration otherwise to be delivered to the Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, with such Cash Consideration to be withheld from the Cash Consideration to be received by each Shareholder in the proportion set forth on _Schedule 2.2(b)_, for use only to the extent the Purchaser or Merger Sub are entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of the Escrow Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. If requested by Representative, an additional portion of the Cash Consideration will be delivered into a separate escrow that may be established by the Shareholders (the " _Shareholders  Escrow_") for the funding among the Shareholders of any other amounts payable under this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Representative will advise the Purchaser as to the amount of Cash Consideration to be funded into the Shareholders Escrow and the amount thereof to be attributable to, and withheld from Cash Consideration otherwise payable to, each Shareholder. 

   

 (d) No certificates or script representing fractional shares of Purchaser Stock shall be issued in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, and no dividend, stock split, or other distribution of the Purchaser shall relate to any such fractional share interest, and no such fractional share interest shall entitle the holder thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of the Purchaser. In lieu of any such fractional share, the Shareholders shall be entitled to receive a cash payment therefor, without interest, at the _pro_ _rata_  amount based on the Average Price. 

   

 (e) With respect to each of the Holsum Special Obligations, the Purchaser intends to claim a Federal income Tax deduction in the first appropriate tax year on account of the payment of such liability. If subsequently any portion of the Federal income Tax deduction is disallowed, each Shareholder, with respect to each share of Company Stock held by such Shareholder at the Effective Time, shall, within sixty (60) days from the date that the determination to disallow the deduction has become final, return to the Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of the disallowed deduction times 37.2% divided by the total number of shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, provided, that the Representative shall have the right to have his advisors participate in any Federal income Tax audit where the deductibility of such items is an issue and to approve any settlement relating to the deductibility of such item, provided further that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and to comply with the "continuity of shareholder interest" requirements (the " _COI Requirements_ ") applicable to such Code section. Consequently, in an effort to comply with the COI Requirements, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Total Cash Consideration shall not exceed 58% (the " _Minimum Percentage_ ") of the Total Merger Consideration; _provided,_ _however_ , that solely for the purpose of this calculation, if the Single-Day Trading Price for the shares of Purchaser Stock is lower than the Average Price, then the Single-Day Trading Price shall be used, _provided_ , _further_ , that (A) the Representative may increase the Minimum Percentage to above 58% as reasonably determined by the Representative after consultation with his tax advisors and the Purchasers tax advisors; and (B) if the Single-Day Trading Price is below the Minimum Price and the Minimum Percentage is exceeded, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the portion of the Merger Consideration that will be paid in stock and that if the parties cannot reach agreement as to the number of shares of Purchaser Stock to be issued that, in the reasonable determination of the Representative, will satisfy the COI Requirements, then the Representative and the Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement. For the sake of clarity, any shares of Purchaser Stock issued at Closing (including any additional shares issued for the purpose of meeting the COI Requirements) shall, for all purposes of this Agreement other than for the purpose of determining whether the Total Cash Consideration is no greater than 58% of the Total Merger Consideration, be valued at the Average Price. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Appointment of Representative_. At or prior to the Closing, the Acquired Company and the Shareholders shall deliver to the Purchaser and the Merger Sub a Shareholder Acknowledgment, Consent and Power of Attorney substantially in the form attached as  _Exhibit C_ executed by each of the Shareholders, pursuant to which the Representative shall be given an irrevocable power of attorney to act exclusively on behalf of such Shareholders with regard to any matters contemplated by this Agreement, to act with regard to the Escrow Agreement and to allocate and distribute any payments received pursuant to this Agreement to the Shareholders, their personal representatives, heirs and assigns.

contemplated herein may be taken by unanimous written consent in lieu of
a meeting. 

   

 Section 2.7 _Net Working Capital Payment Adjustment_. 

  

 (a) For the purpose of calculating the Closing Date Working Capital, the Purchaser shall prepare a consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the accounting principles set forth on  _Schedule 2.7_ and in accordance with GAAP as of the Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall deliver such consolidated balance sheet and a schedule showing the calculation of the Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Working Capital_ ") to the Representative within forty-five (45) days of the Closing Date. The Representative shall have thirty (30) days following delivery of the balance sheet to review the consolidated balance sheet, and the expense of conducting such review shall be borne exclusively by the Representative. The Representative shall have the right to observe the conduct of the physical inventory associated with preparation of the schedule containing the Closing Date Working Capital, such inventory to occur within five (5) days prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) The Purchaser shall provide the Representative with access to (i) work papers of the Acquired Company used to calculate Closing Date Working Capital and (ii) books, non-privileged records and personnel of the Purchaser or the Acquired Company reasonably requested by the Representative to assist the Representative in his review of the Closing Date Working Capital. If the Representative disagrees with the Closing Date Working Capital, the Representative shall notify the Purchaser of such disagreement, setting forth in detail the particulars of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after its receipt of Closing Date Working Capital. In the event of any such notice of disagreement, the Purchaser and the Representative shall use their reasonable efforts for a period of twenty (20) days to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital. If at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve any disagreements, the Purchaser and the Representative shall select, as promptly as practicable, an independent accounting firm with nationally recognized standing other than a firm that is the primary accountant for either the Purchaser, the Acquired Company, Merger Sub or the Shareholders (the " _Accountants_ ") to resolve such disagreements. The Representative and the Purchaser shall each inform the Accountants in writing of their respective determinations of the Closing Date Working Capital and shall cooperate as reasonably requested by the Accountants in its determinations of all disputed items. The Accountants, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, shall resolve as promptly as practicable any such disagreements. The determination of the Accountants shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and such resolution shall be based on the provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation _Schedule 2.7_) relating to the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital. The Representative and the Purchaser shall share equally the fees and expenses incurred by the Accountants in resolving such disagreements. The date of the final resolution of the Working Capital as of the Closing Date shall be referred to as the " _Determination Date_." The amount of the Working Capital as of the Closing Date as finally determined pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the " _Final Working Capital Amount_." 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) In the event that the Final Working Capital Amount is more than the Upper Range of the Target Working Capital, then within ten (10) business days following the Determination Date, Purchaser shall pay to the Shareholders (in the proportions set forth on _Schedule 2.2(b)_) in cash the amount equal to the Final Working Capital Amount minus the Upper Range of the Target Working Capital. In the event that the Final Working Capital Amount is less than the Lower Range of the Target Working Capital, then Purchaser shall be entitled to claim from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the difference between the Lower Range of the Target Working Capital and the Final Working Capital Amount. 

   

 Section 2.8 _Payment Adjustment Amount_. If, during the period beginning on the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the thirty (30) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Payment Adjustment Anniversary_ "), the closing price of Purchaser Stock on the New York Stock Exchange has not equaled or exceeded the Target Price for at least ten (10) consecutive trading days, then the Purchaser shall pay to each Shareholder, within thirty (30) days following the Payment Adjustment Anniversary, an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the difference between the Target Price and the Measurement Date Price and (B) the number of shares of Stock Consideration of which such Shareholder is the Beneficial Owner on the Payment Adjustment Anniversary; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate amount that shall be paid to all of the Shareholders shall not exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Payment Adjustment Amount_ "). The Target Price and the Measurement Date Price shall be adjusted for any recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or like change in Purchasers capitalization following the Closing Date.

  _THE PURCHASER AND THE MERGER SUB_   

  

 The Purchaser and the Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to, and for the benefit of, the Acquired Company and the Shareholders as follows: 

  

 Section 5.1 _Organization_. Each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite corporate or similar powers and authority to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as currently conducted. Each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub is duly qualified to conduct business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 (a) Each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

No vote of, or consent by, the holders of any class or series of stock issued by the Purchaser is or will be necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Purchaser or Merger Sub of this Agreement or the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) This Agreement has been, and at the Closing each of the Ancillary Agreements will be, duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser and Merger Sub, and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof and thereof by the Acquired Company, Holsum Holdings, each Shareholder and each other party hereto or thereto, as the case may be, is or will be a valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser and Merger Sub, enforceable against the Purchaser and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms except (a) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar Laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors rights generally and (b) that the availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunctive or other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and would be subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 5.3 _No Conflicts; Consents_. The execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and compliance with the terms hereof and thereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby does not and will not: (a) violate the organizational documents of the Purchaser or Merger Sub; (b) violate any applicable Law or Order; (c) except as provided in _Section 7.3_ hereof, require the consent, approval or registration of, or any notice filing with, any Governmental Authority; or (d) require the consent or approval of any party to any agreement or commitment to which the Purchaser or Merger Sub is bound; or (e) result in a violation or breach of, conflict with, constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material right or obligation of the Purchaser or Merger Sub or to a loss of any material benefit to which the Purchaser or Merger Sub is entitled under any agreement to which it is a party or other instrument binding upon such company or any Permit or other similar authorization held by the Purchaser or Merger Sub. 

  

 Section 5.4 _Ownership of the Merger Sub Stock_. The Purchaser owns, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record, free and clear of any Lien, all of the issued and outstanding membership units of the Merger Sub. 

  

 Section 5.5 _Purchaser SEC Documents_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.5_, The Purchaser has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated therein) with the SEC required to be filed by the Purchaser since January 1, 2005 (such documents, the " _Purchaser SEC Documents_ "). Each of the Purchaser SEC Documents, as amended or superseded by a subsequent filing made prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material respects with, to the extent in effect at the time of filing, the requirements of the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act and SOX applicable to such Purchaser SEC Documents, and none of the Purchaser SEC Documents when filed or, if so amended or superseded, prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment or superseding filing, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the financial statements (including the related notes) of the Purchaser included in the Purchaser SEC Documents (or incorporated therein by reference) complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto in effect at the time of such filing, had been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Purchaser and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Except as disclosed in Purchaser SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Purchaser SEC Documents_ ") or _Schedule 5.5_, neither Purchaser nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, known or unknown, contingent or otherwise) nor, to the knowledge of Purchaser, does any basis exist therefor, other than (i) liabilities or obligations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred 

   ##### 

  

 

pursuant to contracts entered into after the date hereof not in violation of
this Agreement and (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred pursuant to this
Agreement. Neither the Purchaser nor Merger Sub is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance-sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Purchaser and any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries in the Purchasers published
financial statements or other Purchaser SEC Documents. 

   

 Section 5.6 _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the Purchasers knowledge, overtly threatened against the Purchaser, or before or by any Governmental Authority, that could adversely affect the Purchasers performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.7 _Broker s Fees_. The Purchaser has no liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder, or agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.8 _Financing_. The Purchaser has, and shall have at the Closing Date, sufficient cash and committed credit facilities (i) to pay the full consideration payable to Eisele and the Shareholders and (ii) to make all other necessary payments by it in connection with transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.9 _Tax-Free Reorganization_. Neither the Purchaser nor Merger Sub have knowledge that either the Purchaser or Merger Sub has taken or agreed to take any action (nor does the Purchaser or Merger Sub have knowledge of any fact or circumstance) before or after the Closing that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Purchaser currently does not intend to liquidate Merger Sub, or to merge it into another entity, after the Closing. Merger Sub is a limited liability company owned wholly by the Purchaser that is treated as a disregarded entity for federal and state income Tax purposes and neither the Purchaser nor Merger Sub intend to take any action after the Closing that would change the status of Merger Sub as a disregarded entity for federal and state income Tax purposes.

The Acquired Company shall cause those of its Affiliates that have adopted the Holsum Savings Plan to use commercially reasonable efforts to establish a 401(k) plan prior to Closing and transfer assets attributable to the Affiliates from the Holsum Savings Plan to the newly established 401(k) plan.

 Section 10.3 _Notice and Opportunity to Defend_. 

  

 (a) _Notice of Asserted Liability_. As soon as is reasonably practicable after a Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (as applicable under the circumstances, the Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") becomes aware of any claim that it has under _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_ hereof that may result in a Loss (a " _Liability Claim_ "), it shall give notice thereof (a " _Claims Notice_ ") to either LEE or the Purchaser and Merger Sub as may be applicable under the circumstances (as applicable under the circumstances, Eisele or the Purchaser and Merger Sub, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "). A 

    ##### 

  

    

Claims Notice shall describe the Liability Claim in reasonable detail, and
shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary and to the extent
feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified
Party. No delay in or failure to give a Claims Notice by the Indemnified
Party to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 10.3(a)_
shall adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that the
Indemnified Party has under this Agreement, or alter or relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party to
the extent that such delay or failure has not materially prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (b) _Opportunity to Defend_. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of a Claims Notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement or assertion of any Liability Claim of any Person other than a Purchaser Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, to assume and conduct the defense of such Liability Claim in accordance with the limits set forth in this Agreement with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, to satisfy the amount of any adverse monetary judgment that is reasonably likely to result; and (ii) the Liability Claim solely seeks (and continues to seek) monetary damages; and (iii) the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing that as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the Liability Claim (as finally determined pursuant to the provisions of this _Article X_) in accordance with the limits set forth in this Agreement (the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) are collectively referred to as the " _Litigation Conditions_ "). If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Liability Claim in accordance with this _Section 10.3(b)_ , the Indemnified Party may continue to defend the Liability Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Liability Claim as provided in this _Section 10.3(b)_, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (i) any of the Litigation Conditions cease to be met, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Liability Claim, the Indemnified Party may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense, the defense of any Liability Claim which the other is defending as provided in this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party, if it shall have assumed the defense of any Liability Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Liability Claim that (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a complete release from all liability in respect of such Liability Claim, or (ii) grants any injunctive or equitable relief, or (iii) may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle any Liability Claim, the defense of which has not been assumed by the Indemnifying Party, in its discretion exercised in good faith and upon advice of counsel, either before or after the initiation of litigation, at such time and upon such terms as the Indemnified Party deems fair and reasonable, provided that at least ten (10) days prior to any such settlement, written notice of its intention to settle is given to the Indemnifying Party.

All of the covenants and agreements of Eisele contained in this Agreement shall survive after the Closing Date in accordance with their respective terms. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Eisele have any liability for Losses arising under _Section 10.1(a)_ until the aggregate of all such Losses for which indemnification is sought therefor exceeds Seven Hundred Ninety Five Thousand Dollars ($795,000.00) (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), after which the Purchaser shall be entitled to be fully indemnified for all Losses exceeding the Threshold Amount, subject to the Cap (as defined below). Eiseles aggregate liability for all Losses under _Section 10.1(a)_ shall be limited to Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00) (the " _Cap_ "). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Losses arising pursuant to any matter constituting fraud under applicable Law by the Acquired Company or Eisele and any Liability Claim related to  _Section 10.1(a)(v) _or _Section 10.1(a)(vi)_ shall not be subject to the Threshold Amount or the Cap. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article X_, any indemnification obligations of Eisele to the Purchaser shall be satisfied in the following order until the full amount of such claim has been recovered: (i) the Purchaser shall make a claim pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement against that amount of the Escrow Fund, if any, that is not the subject of a previous claim by the Purchaser and (ii) in the event the amount of the Escrow Fund not subject to previous claims by the Purchaser is insufficient to satisfy its claim, the Purchaser shall seek to collect payment directly from Eisele to recover the amount of such claim (or lesser portion thereof which remains unpaid pursuant to clause (i) above), subject to the Cap. Eisele shall make such payment in cash. 

   

 (e) The Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_ hereof to the extent the subject matter of the claim is covered by insurance (including title insurance) held by the Acquired Company, but only to the extent that such insurance actually pays benefits to, or on behalf of, the Indemnified Parties or the Acquired Company. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) The indemnification obligations of the parties hereto pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be limited to actual Losses and shall not include consequential, punitive, special or loss of opportunity Losses, except to the extent any such consequential, punitive, special or loss of opportunity Losses are part of a Liability Claim made against an Indemnified Party. 

   

 (g) Each Indemnified Party shall take and shall cause their respective Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate and otherwise minimize any Loss to the maximum extent reasonably possible upon and after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Loss. 

   

 Section 10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement or in the case of fraud, the indemnification rights provided in this _Article X_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the parties hereto for any and all Losses related to a breach of any of the terms, conditions, covenants, agreements, representations or warranties contained herein or in any of the Ancillary Agreements hereto, or any right, claim or action arising from the transactions contemplated hereby (and each party hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent that it may do so, any other right or remedy that may arise under any Law); provided that the provisions of this _Section 10.4_ shall not preclude any party from bringing an action for specific performance, or any other equitable remedy to require any other party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement hereto.

 Section 12.14 _Severability_. Any provision hereof which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction will not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

 Section 12.15 _Construction_. The parties and their respective counsel have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
