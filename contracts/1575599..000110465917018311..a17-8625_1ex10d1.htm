such action shall be deferred until the next Business Day.

 



 

(g) The term "made available to Buyer," "delivered to Buyer" or similar

(i) all Liabilities for the Cure Amounts; and

2.5 _Assignment of Contracts, Permits and Other Assets_.

 



 

(a) _Executory Contracts_.

 



 

(i) _Schedule 2.5(a)(i)_ sets forth a list (the " ** _Executory Contract
List_** ") of all Executory Contracts to which any of Sellers is a party or by
which any of Sellers or any of their assets or properties are bound, including
all Material Contracts. Within the time period prescribed by the Bid
Procedures Order, Sellers shall prepare a contract and cure schedule that
identifies for each Contract on the Executory Contract List, the estimated
Cure Amounts (and if no Cure Amount is estimated to be applicable with respect
to any particular Executory Contract, the amount of such Cure Amount has been
designated for such Executory Contract as "$0.00") that must be paid in order
for Sellers to assume, and to assign to Buyer or its Affiliate Designees, as
applicable, each Contract listed thereon pursuant to this Agreement (the " **
_Contract and Cure Schedule_** "). From the Execution Date through (and
including) the Closing, promptly following any material changes to the
information set forth on such schedule (including any new Executory Contracts
to which any of Sellers becomes a party and any change in the Cure Amount of
any such Executory Contract), Sellers shall provide Buyer with a schedule that
updates and corrects the Contract and Cure Schedule. Sellers shall be
responsible for the verification of all Cure Amounts for each Executory
Contract and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to establish the proper
Cure Amounts, if any, for each Executory Contract prior to the Closing Date.
Subject to the terms and provisions of the Bid Procedures Order, Sellers shall
serve a cure notice that includes the Contract and Cure Schedule on the
counterparties to each Contract listed on the Executory Contract List. Any
counterparty to a Contract included on the Executory Contract List shall have
the time period prescribed by the Bid Procedures Order, or any other
applicable Bankruptcy Court Order, to file with the Bankruptcy Court and serve
on Buyer and Sellers an objection to the Cure Amounts listed on the Contract
and Cure Schedule and to the adequate assurance of future performance by
Buyer.

 



 

(ii) _Schedule 2.5(a)(ii)_ sets forth a list of all Contracts listed on the
Executory Contract List or any other Contract to which any of Sellers is a
party or by which any of Sellers or any of their assets or properties are
bound, that are to be assumed by Sellers and assigned to Buyer or its
Affiliate Designees, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement (an " **
_Assigned Contract_** "). All Contracts to which any of Sellers is a party or
by which any of Sellers or any of their assets or properties are bound that
are not designated as Assigned Contracts or listed on the Executory Contract
List shall be deemed to be " ** _Excluded Contracts_** ". Buyer may designate
the Preferential Right

 



      
 

 



 

Contract as an Assigned Contract up to five (5) Business Days prior to Closing
if Buyer reaches agreement with BP to amend such agreement in a manner
satisfactory to Buyer in its sole discretion; _provided_ that Buyer shall make
all payments for Cure Amounts for, and otherwise assume all liabilities with
respect to, the Preferential Right Contract if it becomes an Assigned
Contract. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.5(a)(ii)_ , Sellers
shall be obligated to pay all Cure Amounts (including, for avoidance of doubt,
amounts in excess of the estimated amounts) with respect to each Assigned
Contract. Buyer shall not be required to make any payment for Cure Amounts
for, or otherwise have any liabilities with respect to, any Contract that is
not an Assigned Contract. With respect to each Assigned Contract, Buyer or its
Affiliate Designees, as applicable, shall assume all obligations regarding the
demonstration of adequate assurance of future performance required with
respect to the Assigned Contracts under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.
For the avoidance of doubt, any additions or exclusions of Assigned Contracts
after the Execution Date will not result in any adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

 



 

(b) _Previously Omitted Contracts_.

 



 

(i) If, prior to Closing, and while the Bankruptcy Cases are pending, it is
discovered that a Contract should have been listed on the Executory Contract
List but was not listed on the Executory Contract List (any such Contract, a "
** _Previously Omitted Contract_** "), Sellers shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, following the discovery thereof (but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days following the discovery thereof and in any event
prior to dismissal of the Bankruptcy Cases), (A) notify Buyer of such
Previously Omitted Contract and all Cure Amounts (if any) for such Previously
Omitted Contract, and (B) if required by Buyer, file a motion with the
Bankruptcy Court on appropriate notice to the counterparties to such
Previously Omitted Contract seeking entry of an order (the " ** _Omitted
Contract Order_** ") fixing the Cure Amounts and approving the assumption by
Buyer or its Affiliate Designees, as applicable, and assignment to Buyer or
its Affiliate Designees, as applicable, of such Previously Omitted Contract in
accordance with this _Section 2.5(b)_ ; _provided_ , that no Previously
Omitted Contract shall be assumed and assigned unless such Previously Omitted
Contract shall be designated by Buyer as an "Assigned Contract" in accordance
with this _Section 2.5(b)(i)_ ); _provided, further_ , that Sellers shall be
obligated to pay all Cure Amounts in accordance with _Section 2.5(a)_ related
to any Previously Omitted Contract that is subsequently designated by Buyer as
an Assigned Contract pursuant to this _Section 2.5(b)(i)_.

 



 

(ii) Within five (5) Business Days of its receipt of the notice provided in
_Section 2.5(b)(i)(A)_ , Buyer shall deliver written notice to Sellers,
designating such Previously Omitted Contract as an Assigned Contract or an
Excluded Contract, as Buyer may determine in its sole discretion. For purposes
of the application of this _Section 2.5_ , each Previously Omitted Contract so
designated as an Assigned Contract shall be an Assigned Contract, and each
Previously Omitted Contract so designated as an Excluded Contract shall be an
Excluded Contract. Each Previously Omitted Contract shall then be treated in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.5_ with respect to Assigned
Contracts and Excluded Contracts.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Assigned Permits_. To the extent legally transferable, each of Sellers
will assume and assign and transfer to Buyer or its Affiliate Designees, as
applicable, and Buyer (or its Affiliate Designees) shall accept and assume
from such Seller, effective as of the Closing Date, all of such Sellers
right, title and interest in and to Permits held by such Seller and primarily
applicable to the Businesss or Sellers ownership or operation of the
Pipeline System, Plants, SWD Wells and the other Assets and all rights of such
Seller thereunder (the " ** _Assigned Permits_** "), including those listed on
_Schedule 2.5(c)_. All Permits to which any of Sellers is a party or by which
any of Sellers or any of their assets or properties are bound that are not
Assigned Permits shall be deemed to be " ** _Excluded Permits_** ".

 



 

(d) _Non-Transferable Contracts and Permits_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, and notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 363
and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign or transfer any Contract or Permit or any claim or right
or any benefit or obligation thereunder or resulting therefrom if (i) an
assignment or transfer thereof, without the consent of a third party thereto,
would constitute a breach or violation thereof or is otherwise prohibited or
would in any way adversely affect any of the rights of Buyer or any of its
Affiliate Designees (unless the restrictions on assignment or transfer
thereunder would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-406 through
9-409, inclusive, of the Uniform Commercial Code, as amended, or the
Bankruptcy Code), and (ii) the need for such consent is not obviated or such
prohibition overridden by the effect of the entry of the Sale Order unless and
until such consent shall have been obtained. Sellers shall, and shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Affiliates (and to the
extent applicable, any Insider) to, use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with Buyer at its request in endeavoring to obtain such consents
promptly.

 



 

2.6 _Preferential Purchase Rights_. Sellers shall, within three (3) Business
Days after the Execution Date, provide written notice to BP, with respect to
the preferential purchase right under the Preferential Right Contract. If the
preferential purchase right with respect to the Preferential Right Asset is
exercised by BP prior to the Closing, (i) such Preferential Right Asset and
the related Preferential Right Contract shall be excluded from the Assets and
Executory Contracts conveyed to Buyer or its Affiliate Designee, as
applicable, at the Closing, (ii) such Preferential Right Asset and the related
Preferential Right Contract shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets and Excluded
Contracts, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement, (iii) the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Preferential Right
Amount, and (iv) Sellers shall be entitled to retain all consideration
received for such Preferential Right Asset from BP (or any Affiliate thereof).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sellers may elect,
at such time that all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ (other than
the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(i)_ ) have been satisfied or waived,
to defer the sale of the Preferential Right Asset and to consummate the other
transactions contemplated herein in accordance with the terms hereof, except
that the Purchase Price paid at Closing will be reduced by the Preferential
Right Amount. Notwithstanding the Outside Termination Date, if within one
hundred twenty (120) days from the entry of the Sale Order, the condition set
forth in _Section 7.1(i)_ is satisfied or waived, the Buyer will purchase the
Preferential Right Asset for the Preferential Right Amount within three (3)
Business Days of such condition having been satisfied or waived. If the
condition set forth in _Section 7.1(i)_ is not satisfied or waived within one
hundred twenty (120) days of the entry of the Sale Order, neither the Buyer
nor any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates shall have any further obligation to purchase the Preferential
Right Asset or to pay Sellers the Preferential Right Amount.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
CONSIDERATION**

 



 

3.1 _Consideration_. The consideration for the sale and purchase of the Assets
contemplated by _Section 2.1_ , shall be an amount equal to $189,000,000 (the
" ** _Purchase Price_** "), as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and _Section
3.3_ (as so adjusted, the " ** _Adjusted Purchase Price_** "). At the Closing,
the Adjusted Purchase Price shall be paid by Buyer in cash in the manner set
forth in the Sale Order by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designed by Sellers prior to Closing.

 



 

3.2 _Deposit_. Buyer has deposited, via direct bank deposit or wire transfer
of immediately available Dollars, a cash deposit (the " ** _Deposit_** ") in
an amount equal to $16,000,000 with the Escrow Agent to be held and disbursed
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. If the Closing occurs,
the Deposit shall be applied toward the Purchase Price at the Closing, and the
Parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Sellers at the
Closing. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, then the
Deposit shall be disbursed in accordance with _Section 10.2_.

 



 

3.3 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
follows:

 



 

(a) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

 



 

(i) all Property Expenses paid by or on behalf of Sellers attributable to the
Assets, in each case, to the extent attributable to periods of time on and
after the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) the amount of any Property Taxes allocated to Buyer or any of its
Affiliate Designees pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ but paid by Sellers as of
the Closing Date;

 



 

(iii) an amount equal to the value of imbalances (gathering, processing,
transportation or otherwise) that are associated with the Assets owing to
Sellers as of the Closing Date, with the value to be based on the Gas Daily
published price for the Carthage Hub as of the Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date; and

 



 

(iv) any other amount expressly provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or
otherwise agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer as an upward adjustment
to the Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following amounts
(without duplication):

 



 

(i) all Property Expenses attributable to the Assets, in each case, to the
extent attributable to periods of time prior to the Closing Date and are
unpaid as of the Closing Date and paid or payable by Buyer;

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) the amount of any Property Taxes allocated to Sellers pursuant to
_Section 11.2(a)_ that are unpaid as of the Closing Date and paid or payable
by Buyer;

 



 

(iii) an amount equal to the value of imbalances (gathering, processing,
transportation or otherwise) that are associated with the Assets owed by
Sellers as of the Closing Date, with the value to be based on the Gas Daily
published price for the Carthage Hub as of the Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date; and

 



 

(iv) any other amount expressly provided for elsewhere in this Agreement
(including _Section 2.6_ ) or otherwise agreed upon in writing by Sellers and
Buyer as a downward adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



 

3.4 _Adjustment Methodology_. When available, actual figures will be used for
the adjustments to the Purchase Price at Closing. To the extent actual figures
are not available, estimates will be used, subject to final adjustments in
accordance with _Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.6_.

 



 

3.5 _Preliminary Settlement Statement_. No later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall submit to Buyer a preliminary
settlement statement setting forth Sellers good faith computation of the
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.3_ (the " **
_Preliminary Settlement Statement_** "). Sellers shall provide Buyer
reasonably sufficient data and information supporting the amounts reflected on
the Preliminary Settlement Statement (and reasonable access to Sellers
Representatives) to permit Buyer to perform or cause to be performed an audit
of the Preliminary Settlement Statement. Buyer shall have two (2) Business
Days following its receipt thereof to review the Preliminary Settlement
Statement. On the Business Day following expiration of such review period,
Buyer may submit a written report containing any changes Buyer proposes to be
made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The Parties shall attempt in
good faith to agree on a final Preliminary Settlement Statement and Adjusted
Purchase Price no later than one (1) Business Day prior to Closing. If the
Parties are unable to agree on an adjustment set forth in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement one (1) Business Day prior to Closing, then the amount of
such adjustment used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing shall be the
amount set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by Sellers
pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ , with such adjustments as the Parties have
agreed.

 



 

3.6 _Tax Allocation_. The Purchase Price (as determined for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes), shall be allocated among the Assets in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
(and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate).
Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver a draft
allocation for Sellers approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Buyer and Sellers shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes
relating to the allocation. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve any
such dispute within twenty (20) days of Buyers delivery of the draft
allocation to Sellers, such dispute shall be resolved promptly by the
Accounting Referee, the costs of which shall be borne equally by Buyer, on one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand. If the Adjusted Purchase Price is
further adjusted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the allocation
shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth in this
_Section 3.6_. Buyer and Sellers agree that they will file all Tax Returns
(including IRS Form

 



      
 

 



 

8594) consistent with the allocation agreed to by Buyer and Sellers, or
determined by the Accounting Referee (the " ** _Allocation_** "). Neither
Buyer nor Sellers shall take any Tax position inconsistent with the Allocation
and neither Buyer nor Sellers shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the
Allocation by any taxing authority without first giving the other party prior
written notice. If, contrary to the intent of the Parties hereto as expressed
in this _Section 3.6_ , any taxing authority makes or proposes an allocation
inconsistent with the Allocation, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each
other in good faith to contest such taxing authoritys allocation (or proposed
allocation); _provided, however_ , that, after consultation with the Party (or
Parties) adversely affected by such allocation (or proposed allocation), the
other Party (or Parties) hereto may file such protective claims or Tax Returns
as may be reasonably required to protect its (or their) interests.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or
Sellers from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any taxing
authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation, and neither Buyer nor
Sellers shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency
or adjustment by any taxing authority challenging the Allocation.

 



 

3.7 _Revenues and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except to the extent otherwise reflected in an adjustment to the Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 3.3_ :

 



 

(i) Sellers shall remain entitled to all of the rights of ownership (including
the right to all revenues and proceeds) of the Assets prior to the Closing
Date and shall remain responsible for all Property Expenses and Property Taxes
attributable to the period of time prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) subject to the occurrence of the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliate
Designees, as applicable, shall be entitled to all of the rights of ownership
(including the right to all revenues and proceeds from Third Parties) of the
Assets attributable to the period of time from and after the Closing Date,
and, shall be responsible (by payment, through the adjustments to the Purchase
Price hereunder or otherwise) for all Property Expenses and Property Taxes
attributable to the period of time from and after the Closing Date; and

 



 

(iii) all Property Expenses and Property Taxes attributable to the Assets, in
each case, that are: (A) incurred or apportioned with respect to operations
conducted prior to the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of Sellers and
(B) incurred or apportioned with respect to operations conducted on and after
the Closing Date, shall be the responsibility of Buyer.

 



 

(b) Without duplication of any adjustments made to the Purchase Price pursuant
to _Section 3.3_ , if (i) any Party receives monies belonging to another
Party, then such amount shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the end of
the month in which such amount was received, be paid over to the proper Party,
(ii) a Party receives an invoice of a Property Expense that is owed by another
Party, such Party receiving the invoice shall promptly forward such invoice to
the Party responsible for the same, and (iii) an invoice or other evidence of
a Property Expense is received by a Party, which is partially an obligation of
both Sellers, on one

 



      
 

 



 

hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, then the Parties shall consult with each
other, and each Party shall be responsible for its portion of such obligation
to the obligee.

6.2 _Access and Information_.

 



 

(a) From the Execution Date until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article X_ , but subject to
the other provisions of this _Section 6.2_ and obtaining any required Consents
of Third Parties (with respect to which consents Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), Sellers shall afford to Buyer and
its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, and
permit same to conduct a reasonable inspection of, all of the offices,
facilities, properties, assets, inventories, and non-privileged books,
records, and documents of Sellers, and will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish Buyer with such additional financial and operating data and
other information relating to the Business, the Assumed Liabilities and the
Assets as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request, including providing
access to any physical or virtual data room and any other access or
information provided to any other potential bidder. Sellers shall also make
available to Buyer and its Representatives, upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours, Sellers personnel knowledgeable with respect to the
Assets in order that Buyer may make such diligence investigation as Buyer
considers reasonably necessary or appropriate. All investigations and due
diligence conducted by Buyer or any of its Representatives shall be conducted
at Buyers sole cost, risk and expense and any conclusions made from any
examination done by Buyer or any of its Representative shall result from
Buyers own independent review and judgment. Buyer shall coordinate Buyers
and its Representatives access rights (including with respect to Sellers
personnel) and physical inspections of the Assets with Sellers and their
Representatives to minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the
conduct of business by Sellers, and Sellers shall have the right to accompany
Buyer and any Representative of Buyer in connection with any such access
rights. Buyer shall not be authorized to perform sampling of any environmental
media or perform testing or operation of any equipment without obtaining the
applicable Sellers prior written consent. Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause
all of its Representatives to, abide by all Governmental Authorities and
Sellers safety rules, regulations and operating policies while conducting
Buyers due diligence evaluation of the Assets, including any environmental or
other inspection or assessment of the Assets. No information provided to or
obtained by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.2(a)_ or otherwise shall limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder to Buyer, or the representations or warranties of, or the conditions
to the obligations of, the Parties. Buyer hereby indemnifies Sellers and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and all Damages
(including any injury, loss or damage arising out of such entry that may occur
to Buyer or any Representative of Buyer) caused by Buyer or any Representative
of Buyer during any office visit, field visit, environmental property
assessment or other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any
Representative of Buyer with respect to the Assets, REGARDLESS OF ANY
CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY ON THE PART OF ANY SELLER OR ANY
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY SELLER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF CLAIM WHETHER AT
COMMON LAW, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER ANY STATUTE OR REGULATION.

 



 

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that after the Closing, Sellers, their
respective Affiliates, successors to any of Sellers and their respective
Affiliates (including, without limitation, any liquidating trustee or chapter
7 trustee subsequently appointed to administer Sellers bankruptcy estate or
any assets that comprised such bankruptcy estate), Sellers prepetition
lenders and designated agents and representatives thereof (each such party, an
" ** _Access Party_** " and collectively, the " ** _Access Parties_** "), may
need access to information or documents or other business records in the
control or possession of Buyer and its Affiliates (whether such records are
physical or electronic, including, without limitation, any records stored on
any computer systems or similar information systems acquired by Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement for one or more purposes, including without limitation: (i)
preparing or filing Tax Returns; (ii) selling, using, monetizing or otherwise
disposing of any Excluded Assets; and (iii) pursuing any Avoidance Actions or
other claims or causes of action of any of Sellers or their bankruptcy estate
(other than claims or causes of action against Buyer). Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate in connection with, and, during normal business hours, make
available for inspection and copying by such Access Parties or their
successors or representatives, upon prior written request and at their sole
cost and expense, such information, documents, business records and other
analogous information included in the Assets, as reasonably requested by such
Access Parties.

 



 

6.3 _Regulatory Filings_. From the Execution Date until the Closing, each of
Buyer and Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (a)
make or cause to be made the filings required of such Party or any of its
Affiliates under any applicable Laws, including the HSR Act, with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to pay any fees due of it
in connection with such filings, as promptly as is reasonably practicable and
in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the Execution Date (except
for such filings that are customarily made after the assignment of properties
similar to the Assets), (b) cooperate with and assist the other Party and
furnish all information in such Partys possession that is necessary in
connection with such other Partys filings and in obtaining the relevant
Consent from the applicable Governmental Authority, (c) use commercially

waiting periods under the HSR Act (including requesting early termination
thereof) and any other Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by

the extent permitted under applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Law, consult and cooperate in advance with the other Party prior to making,
and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection with,
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and
opinions made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with all
meetings, actions and proceedings with Governmental Authorities relating to
such filings, and (f) comply, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, with
any requests received by such Party or any of its Affiliates under the HSR Act
and any other Laws for additional information, documents or other materials.
Neither Party shall participate in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority with respect to such filings or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority, unless, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
the Governmental Authority, gives the other Party reasonable prior notice of,
and an opportunity to attend and participate in, such meeting. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed so as to
require Buyer or Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates, without its
written consent, to sell, license, dispose of, hold separate or operate in any
specified manner any assets or businesses of Buyer or Sellers (or to require
Buyer or Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates to agree to any of the
foregoing). The obligations of each party under this _Section 6.3_ to use
commercially reasonable efforts with respect to antitrust matters shall be
limited to compliance with the reporting provisions of the HSR Act and other
applicable Laws and with its obligations under this _Section 6.3_.

 



 

6.4 _Governmental Consents_. Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.3_
, Sellers and Buyer shall each use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain at the earliest practical date all Consents, waivers, approvals,
orders, Permits, authorizations and declarations from, make all filings with,
and provide all notices to, all Governmental Authorities (including Bankruptcy
Court approvals) which are required to consummate, or in connection with, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.5 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_. If, after the Execution Date but prior to
the Closing Date, all or any portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by
fire or other casualty (a " ** _Casualty_** ") or is taken in condemnation or
under right of eminent domain (a " ** _Condemnation Proceeding_** "), then
Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close and Sellers, at Closing, shall
pay to Buyer (or its designee) all sums paid to Sellers by Third Parties by
reason of such Casualty or Condemnation Proceeding with respect to the
affected Assets and shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or Buyers
designee all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in recovery
proceeds, unpaid awards and other rights against Third Parties (excluding any
liabilities or claims of or against Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates and Representatives) arising out of such Casualty or Condemnation
Proceeding with respect to the affected Assets; _provided, however_ , that
Sellers shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Sellers) all
rights, title, interests and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of
Sellers costs and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in pursuing or
asserting any such insurance claims or other rights against Third Parties or
in defending or asserting rights in connection with such Casualty or
Condemnation Proceeding; _provided, further_ , if the costs and expenses
associated with any such Casualty and/or Condemnation Proceedings exceed (or
are likely to exceed), in aggregate, ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price,
either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other
Party prior to Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

6.6 _Seller Marks_. Buyer shall obtain no right, title, interest, license or
any other right whatsoever to use the terms "Azure" or any trademarks, service
marks, slogans or logos containing or comprising the foregoing, or any
trademark, service mark, slogan or logo confusingly similar thereto or
dilutive thereof (collectively, the " ** _Seller Marks_** "). From and after
the Closing, Buyer agrees (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) that it
shall (a) cease using the Seller Marks in any manner, directly or indirectly,
as promptly as possible after the Closing and in any event within ninety (90)
days following the Closing Date, and (b) remove, strike over or otherwise
obliterate all Seller Marks from all Assets and all other materials owned,
possessed or used by Buyer or its Affiliates within ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date. With respect to any Seller Mark that may appear on any of
the physical assets constituting the Assets, Buyer is hereby granted a fully-
paid-up, royalty-free, limited right and license solely to allow Buyer to
display or retain such Seller Mark on such Assets, in the places and in the
forms in which they appear on such Assets at Closing, for ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date.

 



 

6.7 _Record Retention_. To the extent required by Law or otherwise, Sellers
and Buyer agree that each of them shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the Business for a
period of five (5) years from the Closing Date and shall make such records and
personnel available to the other as may be reasonably required by such party
in connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by, Actions
against or governmental investigations of Sellers or Buyer or any of their
Affiliates or in order to enable Sellers or Buyer to comply with their
respective obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document
or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event Sellers or Buyer
wish to destroy (or permit to be destroyed, including pursuant to any
liquidation or winding up of such Person) such records after that time, such
Party shall first give forty-five (45) days prior written notice to the other,
and such other Party shall have the right, at its option and expense, upon
prior written notice given to such Party within that forty-five (45) day
period, to take possession or make copies of the records within forty-five
(45) days after the date of such notice. This covenant shall survive Closing.

 



 

6.8 _Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees_. Buyer acknowledges that none of
the Security Arrangements are transferable to Buyer. Except to the extent
that Buyer will, as of Closing, be covered by the Security Arrangements of the
operators of the applicable Assets, then on or before the Closing Date, Buyer
will obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of Buyer, replacements for
such Security Arrangements, to the extent such replacements are necessary to
permit the cancellation as of Closing of the Security Arrangements posted by
Sellers and/or their respective Affiliates. To the extent cancellation of any
Security Arrangement has not occurred as of the Closing Date, and Sellers
waive compliance with this _Section 6.8_ at Closing, Buyer shall, after
Closing, fully indemnify Sellers and their respective Affiliates for any claim
made by any Third Party in respect of any such Security Arrangement until such
time that such Security Arrangement is terminated. For the avoidance of doubt,
this covenant shall survive the Closing.

 



 

6.9 _Assigned Permits_. Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, take all commercially reasonable actions necessary or desirable
under the applicable Laws with the appropriate Governmental Authorities to
transfer the Assigned Permits to Buyer, and to assist Buyer in obtaining any
other Permits required for the operation and conduct of the Business or the
Assets. If the applicable Laws require certain actions to be taken upon or
after Closing, Sellers shall take all commercially reasonable actions
necessary or desirable under the applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Laws with the appropriate Governmental Authorities to transfer the Assigned
Permits to Buyer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing. Any
and all fees required by any Governmental Authority or any Person to obtain or
for the transfer of a Permit shall be paid directly by and be the sole
responsibility of Buyer.

 



 

6.10 _Access to Title Records_. From the date hereof until Closing, Sellers
will make available to Buyer for Buyers inspection copies of all deeds,
easements, rights-of-way, leases, surveys, title policies, title reports and
other records in Sellers or any of their Affiliates possession or control
relating to the title to the Real Property Interests (the " ** _Title
Records_** "). Sellers will cooperate with Buyer and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate Buyers inspection of the Title Records;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall have no obligation to cure,
correct or remove, or cause the cure, correction or removal of, any purported
Liens or other title defects disclosed in the Title Records.

 



 

6.11 _Post-Closing Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing, Sellers
shall, and shall direct its Representatives and Affiliates to, keep
confidential and not disclose any and all information relating to the Assets
(the " ** _Restricted Information_** "), and shall not, directly or
indirectly, use such Restricted Information for any purpose, except as and to
the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents. The obligation shall continue indefinitely from the Closing Date
and shall not apply to any information that (a) is in the public domain, (b)
is published or otherwise becomes part of the public domain through no fault
of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or (c) becomes available to
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from
a source that did not acquire such information (directly or indirectly) on a
confidential basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers may make
disclosures required by applicable Law or as is necessary to enforce this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that Sellers, to the extent practicable,
shall provide Buyer with prompt notice thereof so that Buyer, at its sole cost
and expense, may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive
compliance with the provisions of this _Section 6.11_. In the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained or Buyer waives compliance
with the provisions of this _Section 6.11_ , Sellers shall or shall cause the
Person required to disclose such Restricted Information to furnish only that
portion of the information that such Person is legally required, and, to the
extent practicable, Sellers shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment is accorded the
Restricted Information so furnished.

 



 

6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Sellers shall give notice to Buyer as
promptly as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of, and in any event
(x) prior to Closing of (a) any fact, change, condition, circumstance, event,
occurrence or non-occurrence that has caused or is reasonably likely to cause
any representation or warranty in this Agreement made by Sellers to be untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect at any time after the date hereof and
prior to the Closing, (b) any material failure on its part to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder, (c) the institution of, written threat or, to the Knowledge
of Sellers, oral threat of institution of any Proceeding against Sellers
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or (d) any
material theft, damage, condemnation, taking, destruction or Casualty or
Condemnation Proceeding relating to the Assets; and (y) prior to the Sale
Order or the receipt of any proposal from a Third Party for any transaction
(or series of transactions) involving the sale, transfer, lease or other
disposition

 



      
 

 



 

of, directly or indirectly, including through an asset sale, stock sale,
merger, foreclosure, reorganization or other similar transaction, including
pursuant to a stand-alone plan of reorganization or refinancing, directly or
indirectly, all or a portion of the Assets (or agreement to do any of the
foregoing) to a Person or Persons other than Buyer or to effect any other
transaction the consummation of which would be substantially inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement (such a transaction, an " ** _Alternative
Transaction_** "), other than the Back-Up Bid; _provided_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.12_ shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice, or
the representations or warranties of, or the conditions to the obligations of,
the Parties.

 



 

6.13 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Sellers shall
provide Buyer with the contact information for each then-current Employee.
Additionally, after the Execution Date, Sellers shall provide Buyer with
reasonable access during normal business hours to additional employee
information relating to each Employee, in each case to the extent permissible
under applicable Laws (including any limitations applicable to medical or any
other records) and as necessary in order to assist Buyer in satisfying its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.13_. At least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Buyer or its Affiliate may make offers to hire any of
the Employees, subject to any such Employee satisfying Buyers lawful pre-
employment screening process and the occurrence of the Closing, with such
offers to become effective on the Closing Date and at base salaries or hourly
rates of pay (as applicable), bonuses and other compensation opportunities,
and employee benefits that are set in Buyers sole and absolute discretion.
For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be under no obligation whatsoever to
hire or offer to hire any or all of the Employees.

 



 

(b) This _Section 6.13_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.13_ ,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.13_. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend,
or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 6.13_ shall
not create any right of any employee or any other Person to any continued
employment with Sellers, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 



 

6.14 _No Dismissal_. During the period commencing on the Execution Date and
ending on the earlier of (a) the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (b) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ ,
Sellers covenant that, without Buyers prior written consent, none of Sellers
nor any of their appointees, Representatives (including legal counsel),
agents, trustees, or other similar Person shall take any action designed to
(i) dismiss the Bankruptcy Cases (including making any request to the
Bankruptcy Court in relation to any such dismissal), or (ii) convert the
Bankruptcy Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (including
making any request to the Bankruptcy Court in relation to any such
conversion), in the case of either (i) or (ii), at any time prior to the
Closing Date.

 



       
 

 



 

6.15 _RESERVED_.

 



 

6.16 _Transition Services; Non-Solicitation_. Sellers and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith and enter into a
Transition Services Agreement, effective as of the Closing Date, pursuant to
which Sellers and their Affiliates will provide certain services to Buyer for
a period to be mutually agreed by the Parties of up to six (6) months after
the Closing for a monthly fee to be mutually agreed by the Parties. Buyer
agrees that such Transition Services Agreement will contain payment terms that
require prepayment of each months services on the first day of such month.
Buyer agrees that during such mutually agreed period and for twelve (12)
months thereafter, Buyer shall not, without Sellers (or their applicable
Affiliates) prior written consent, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit,
encourage, entice or induce any employee of Sellers providing such services to
terminate his or her employment or engagement with any Seller or (b) hire any
such employee.

 



 

6.17 _BP Gas Gathering Agreement_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the date that is six (6) months
after Closing, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate
and enter into, and Buyer may participate and, at Sellers request, reasonably
assist Sellers in negotiating and entering into, a BP Partial Assignment;
_provided, however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
require Buyer to expend any costs or expenses or make any commercial
concession with respect to any such assistance or participation, whether
before or after the Closing. If the BP Partial Assignment is not obtained
prior to or at Closing, Buyer shall assume the BP Back-to-Back Agreement and
the BP Back-to-Back Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) Unless the BP Partial Assignment is obtained prior to Closing, Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the BP Back-to-Back
Agreement to be amended, effective as of the Closing, to afford Buyer
reasonable audit rights of the accounts of (i) Azure Shelby and (ii) Azure
Midstream Energy, LLC related to the BP Gas Gathering Agreement; _provided_ ,
that the failure to obtain such amendment shall not be deemed to be a failure
of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ to be satisfied.

 



 

6.18 _Bankruptcy Deposits_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, at
Sellers sole cost and expense, reasonably assist, but shall have no
obligation to substitute, Sellers in obtaining the return of any and all
outstanding Bankruptcy Deposits and shall promptly (but no later than three
(3) Business Days following receipt of any such Bankruptcy Deposit) deliver

11.2 _Allocation of Property Taxes_.

respect to the Assets for any Tax period beginning on or after the Closing
Date (a " ** _Post-Closing Tax Period_** "); and (iii) responsibility for
Property Taxes with respect to the Assets for a Straddle Period shall be
allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately prior
to the Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on the
Closing Date by prorating each such Property Tax based on the number of days
of such Straddle Period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period, on the one
hand, and the number of days of such Straddle Period included in the Post-
Closing Tax Period, on the other hand. Sellers shall be liable for the
proportionate amount of such Property Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of
such Property Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt of any bill for such Property Taxes, Buyer or Sellers, as
applicable, shall present a statement to the other setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which each is entitled under this _Section 11.2(b)_ (taking
into account any adjustments to the Purchase Price that were taken into
account pursuant to _Sections 3.3(a)(ii)_ and _3.3(b)(i)_ ), with respect to
such Property Taxes, together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably
necessary to calculate the proration amount. The proration amount shall be
paid by the Party owing it to the other within 10 days after delivery of such
statement. In the event that Buyer or Sellers make any payment for which it is
entitled to reimbursement under this _Section 11.2(b)_ , the applicable Party
shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than 10 days
after the presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which the presenting Party is entitled along with such
supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of
reimbursement.

 



      
 

 



 

11.3 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate fully
with each other, including with respect to the furnishing or making available
during normal business hours of records, personnel (as reasonably required),

in connection with the preparation of all Tax Returns by Buyer or Sellers with
respect to the Assets, the making of any election relating to Taxes with
respect to the Assets, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority
with respect to the Assets and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit
or proceeding relating to any Tax with respect to the Assets or the
Allocation. Such cooperation shall include the retention of records and
information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided

respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any Tax period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective Tax periods, and such additional period as
necessary for any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to any
proposed assessment, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Governmental Authority.

 



 

11.4 _Tax Audits_. Sellers shall control any Proceeding with respect to any
Property Taxes or Tax Returns for Property Taxes relating to any Assets (" **
_Tax Audit_** ") solely relating to any taxable period ending before the
Closing Date, and Buyer shall control any other Property Tax Audit. Neither

consent, which consent such other Party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay
or condition.

 



 

11.5 _Tax Refunds_. Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of Property Taxes
with respect to the Assets with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer
shall be entitled to any refund of Property Taxes with respect to the Assets
with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period. Refunds for a Straddle Period shall
be apportioned based on the Property Taxes for such period that were paid by
or on behalf of Buyer and Sellers. The Parties and their Affiliates shall
reasonably cooperate with the other Party in connection with obtaining any
refund of Taxes as set forth in this _Section 11.5_. If a Party receives a
refund to which the other Party is entitled, such recipient Party shall

Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign this
Agreement or any rights, interest, obligations or other parts hereof without

12.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Appendixes,
Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and the Transaction Documents and the

and supersede any other agreements or representations, whether written or
oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of the Parties
or any of their respective Affiliates relating in any way to the transactions
contemplated hereby or the subject matter of this Agreement. Each Party agrees
not to assert that it did not understand it, that it mistakenly signed it,
that it signed under duress or coercion, that it lacks mental or other
capacity, that one Party has discriminated against the other Party in any way
or that it has made any representations or has any understanding or agreement
other than as set forth in this Agreement, which fully recites all agreements

obligations at Law or under the applicable rules of any stock or commodities
exchange, and, to the extent reasonably practicable, after consultation with
the other Party and such other Partys reasonable review and comment.

 



 

12.11 _Non-Waiver_. No waiver by either Party of any default by the other
Party in the performance of any provision, condition or requirement herein
shall be deemed to be a waiver of, or in any manner release the other Party
from, performance of any other provision, condition or requirement herein, nor
shall such waiver be deemed to be a waiver of, or in any manner a release of,
the other Party from future performance of the same provision, condition or
requirement. Any delay or omission of either Party to exercise any right
hereunder shall not impair the exercise of any such right, or any like right,
accruing to it thereafter. The failure of either Party to perform its
obligations hereunder shall not release the other Party from the performance
of such obligations.

the transactions contemplated herein are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the
