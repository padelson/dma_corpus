accordance with this _Section 2.3_ and  _Schedule 2.3(a)_ hereto.

(b) The Sellers Representative shall have fifteen (15) Business Days

such objection.

(c) In connection with the Sellers Representatives review and regardless
of whether any Dispute Notice has been served, the Sellers Representative and
its Representatives shall have reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice and in such a manner as to not unduly
interfere with the operations of the business, to all relevant work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by Purchaser or
its Representatives in connection with the preparation of the Preliminary
Earnout Payment Statement or the amounts or calculations set forth thereon and
to personnel of Purchaser and its Representatives and any other information
which the Sellers Representative reasonably requests, and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, cooperate with the Sellers
Representative and its Representatives in connection therewith.

(d) In the event that the Sellers Representative shall deliver a Dispute

such resolution, if any, any adjustments to the Preliminary Earnout Payment
Statement shall be made in accordance with the written agreement of Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative. If Purchaser and the Sellers Representative

longer period as Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall agree in
writing) of the delivery of such Dispute Notice, such dispute shall be
resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, and such determination shall be

the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of
such disputed items.

(e) The Preliminary Earnout Payment Statement, (i) if no Dispute Notice
has been timely delivered as of the sixteenth (16th) Business Day following
receipt of the Preliminary Earnout Payment Statement from Purchaser, or (ii)
if a Dispute Notice has been timely delivered, as determined pursuant to the
resolution of such dispute in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_, shall be,
respectively, the " _Final Earnout Payment Statement_ ".

(f) Within five (5) Business Days after the date that the Final Earnout
Payment Statement is determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ (but in any
event no later than April 5, 2010) (the applicable date being referred to as
the " _Earnout Due Date_ "), Purchaser shall pay an aggregate amount in cash
equal to the Earnout Payment, if any, as reflected on the Final Earnout
Payment Statement less the aggregate amount of EO Setoff Amounts, if any, to
each Selling Unit Holder and Blocker Party in an amount equal to (i) the
product of the Earnout Payment as reflected on the Final Earnout Payment
Statement multiplied by such Selling Unit Holders or Blocker Partys direct
(or indirect in the case of the Blocker Parties) ownership percentage in
PinnOak as set forth opposite such Selling Unit Holders or Blocker Partys
name on _Schedule 2.3(f)_ (the percentage applicable to a Selling Unit Holder
or Blocker Party being referred to as such Persons " _Ownership Percentage_
") less (ii) the aggregate amount of EO Setoff Amounts, if any, allocable to
such Selling Unit Holder or Blocker Party in accordance with  _Section
8.6(a)_.

(g) For purposes of this _Section 2.3_:

set forth on _Schedule 2.3(a)_ , but shall in no event exceed $326.0 million.

such Monthly Statement and to personnel of Purchaser and its Representatives
and any other information which the Sellers Representative reasonably
requests, and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
cooperate with the Sellers Representative and its Representatives in
connection therewith. In addition, during the Earnout Period, Purchaser shall
at the Sellers Representatives reasonable request, but not more frequently
than quarterly, meet (telephonically or in person) with Purchaser to discuss
the operation of the business of PinnOak, including, but not limited to,
financial results or other issues relating to the Earnout Payment and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, cooperate with the
Sellers Representative and its Representatives in connection therewith. No
failure or delay by the Sellers Representative to raise any objection to or
dispute any amount set forth on a Monthly Statement shall be deemed an
acceptance of any such amount or operate as a waiver by the Sellers
Representative of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the right of the

Selling Unit Holders for all reasonable expenses, including attorney fees,
incurred by the Selling Unit Holders in connection with seeking
the collection of the Earnout Payment.

(m) Each of the Selling Unit Holders, the Earnout Participants and the
Sellers Representative acknowledges and agrees that (i) Purchaser makes no
representations nor provides any assurances whatsoever as to the feasibility
of achieving the Earnout Payment or any portion thereof and (ii) neither
the Purchaser nor, from and after the Closing Date, PinnOak owe any fiduciary
duty to the Selling Unit Holders, the Earnout Participants or the Seller
Representative by virtue of the Earnout Payment.

Section 2.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. As promptly as practicable
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and in any case prior

of the Purchase Price (and all other capitalizable costs) among the assets for
purposes of Section 751 of the Code as of the date of the Closing. Within 120
days after the Closing in compliance with Section 751 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder and consistent with the Initial Tax
Allocation Statement, the Selling Unit Holders shall prepare or cause to be
prepared a statement (the " _Tax Allocation Statement_ ") allocating the

Purchaser, PinnOak and the Selling Unit Holders shall (i) timely file all
forms and Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with such
allocation, (ii) be bound by such allocation for purposes of determining
Taxes, (iii) prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to prepare and file,

Allocation Statement is disputed by any Tax authority, the party receiving
notice of such dispute shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
concerning the existence and resolution of such dispute.

transactions contemplated hereby. PinnOak is duly qualified, licensed or
admitted to do business and is in good standing in those jurisdictions set
forth in _Section 4.1 of the Disclosure Schedule_, which are the only
jurisdictions in which the ownership, use or leasing of its assets
and properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such
qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for those
jurisdictions in which the failure by PinnOak to be so qualified, licensed or
admitted and in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by PinnOak, the performance by
PinnOak of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by PinnOak of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all of the
members of PinnOak and all requisite limited liability company action on the
part of PinnOak. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
PinnOak, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Selling Unit Holders and Purchaser) this Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of PinnOak, enforceable against PinnOak in
accordance with its terms, subject to the

 effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance or similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Section 4.2 _Subsidiaries_. Each Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of
formation is identified in  _Section 4.2 of the Disclosure Schedule_. Each
Subsidiary is a limited liability company duly formed, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation, and has full
limited liability company power and authority to conduct its business as and
to the extent now conducted and to own, use and lease its assets and
properties. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do
business and is in good standing in those jurisdictions specified in _Section
4.2 of the Disclosure Schedule_, which are the only jurisdictions in which the
ownership, use or leasing of its assets and properties, or the conduct or
nature of its business, makes such qualification, licensing or
admission necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure by
such Subsidiary to be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding equity
interests or other voting securities of each Subsidiary are owned directly by
PinnOak free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens). Other than
the Subsidiaries, PinnOak does not own, directly or indirectly, any equity
interest in any Person, nor is it a partner or member of any partnership,
limited liability company or joint venture.

Section 4.3 _No Conflict_. Assuming all consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions described in _Section 4.4_ have been
obtained, and except as set forth in _Section 4.3 of the Disclosure Schedule_
or as may result from any facts or circumstances relating to Purchaser, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by PinnOak and the
consummation by PinnOak of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and
will not (a) violate or conflict with the certificate of formation or
operating agreement of PinnOak or any Subsidiary, (b) conflict with or violate
any Law or Governmental Order applicable to PinnOak or any Subsidiary, or (c)
result in any material breach of, or constitute a material default (or event
which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a
material default) under, or give to any Person any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any
Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any of the assets or properties of
PinnOak or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract to which PinnOak or any
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective assets or properties
are bound. 

Section 4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except as set forth in _Section
4.4 of the Disclosure Schedule_, the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by PinnOak do not, and the performance of this Agreement by PinnOak will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or other action by, or filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority or Person, except (a) the
notification requirements of the HSR Act and foreign antitrust and competition
law requirements, (b) where failure to obtain

 such consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing or
notification, would not prevent PinnOak from performing any of its
material obligations under this Agreement, (c) as may be necessary as a
result of any facts or circumstances relating solely to Purchaser or its
Affiliates or (d) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals or
authorizations, to take such action, or to make such filing or notification
(other than any of the foregoing addressed in clause (a) through (c) above)
would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5 _Capitalization_. _Section 4.5 of the Disclosure Schedule_
sets forth the entire authorized equity interests of PinnOak and the total
number of issued and outstanding Units. All of the outstanding Units are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned, beneficially and of
record, by the Selling Unit Holders in the classes, amounts and percentages
set forth in _Section 4.5 of the Disclosure Schedule_, and no Units are
subject to any preemptive rights. There are no outstanding options, warrants,
calls, rights or other contracts or instruments of any character (including
any member or operating agreement, buy-sell agreement or other similar
agreement) requiring, and there are no securities of PinnOak outstanding which
upon conversion or exchange would require, the issuance, sale or transfer
of any additional membership interests, units or other equity securities of
PinnOak or other securities convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing
the right to subscribe for or purchase membership interests, units or other
equity securities of PinnOak. None of the Units were issued or, since
issuance, has been transferred, in violation of Law or contract, including any
pre-emptive right, right of first refusal or other similar right of any
Person. There are no restrictions on the transfer of the Units as
contemplated in this Agreement.

with past practice. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
PinnOak (or the applicable Subsidiary) has a good and valid title to all of

and Existing Title Insurance Policies made available by PinnOak are true,
correct and complete in all material respects. Other than the Farming and
Residential Leases (as defined below) and other than as set forth in Schedule
B of any of the Existing Title Insurance Policies or on _Section 4.10(c) of
the Disclosure Schedule_, neither PinnOak nor any of the Subsidiaries is a
party to any lease, license, sublease or similar occupancy agreement under

business of PinnOak and to comply with applicable Law (other than any non-
compliance which would not have a Material Adverse Effect); PinnOak (or the
applicable Subsidiary) is not in material default under any document
evidencing such easement or right of way; and, to the Knowledge of PinnOak,
(i) all such documents are in full force and effect, (ii) the other party to
each document is not in material default thereunder and (iii) to the
Knowledge of PinnOak, no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of
time, would constitute a material breach or default by PinnOak (or such
Subsidiary) or the other party under any such document.

representation or warranty with respect to the accuracy or completeness of
any such study.

PinnOak. Except for such claims which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect, there are no pending or threatened claims of which PinnOak has been
given written notice by any Person against its use of any Intellectual
Property. PinnOak has such ownership of or such rights by license, lease or
other agreement to the Intellectual Property as are necessary to conduct the

such rights would not have a Material Adverse Effect. PinnOak or its
Subsidiaries owns and has good and exclusive title to each item of

Permitted Liens. None of the Intellectual Property is subject to any Action or
Governmental Order restricting in a material respect the use, transfer or

material respect the validity, use or enforceability of such Intellectual
Property.

two years, (iii) the most recent summary plan description, (iv) the most
recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter, (v) all material
contracts, arrangements or agreements related to each Employee Plan, and (vi)
all material correspondence received from any governmental agency with
respect to an Employee Plan.

compensation due any Employee.

(m) No prior payment of any amount, nor any payment due or to become due

Regarding Eligibility for Retiree Health Care between U.S. Steel Mining
Company, LLC and the United Mine Workers of America, International Union,
dated as of May 6, 2003, and the related Agreement between the International
Union, United Mine Workers of America, and United States Steel Corporation,
dated May 6, 2003, each remain in full force and effect and the transactions

Act, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety and health,
mine safety and workers compensation (collectively, the " _Employment and
Labor Laws_ "), in each case except (i) for citations issued by the Mining

its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of PinnOaks and the
Subsidiaries continuing operations or (ii) for violations the existence of

have been paid (regardless of whether set forth on a Tax Return) other than
Taxes which are not yet due or which, if due, are not delinquent or are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or have not been
finally determined, and for which, in each case, adequate reserves have been
established in the books and records of PinnOak and the Interim Financial
Statements. PinnOak has not received any written notice of deficiency from a
Governmental Authority for any material Tax against PinnOak. Neither PinnOak

to treat PinnOak as an association or corporation for U.S. federal or state
Tax purposes. Except as set forth in  _Section 4.16 to the Disclosure
Schedule_, there are no Tax claims, audits or proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of PinnOak, threatened in connection with PinnOak or with respect to
which PinnOak could have any liability. There are not currently in force any
waivers or agreements binding upon PinnOak for the extension of time for the
assessment or payment of any Tax. PinnOak and each Subsidiary, as applicable,
has properly withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and
paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor or
other third party. PinnOak is not a party to or

 bound by any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement with any other Person
nor does it have any contractual obligation to indemnify any other Person
with respect to Taxes. Neither the Units nor PinnOaks assets are subject to
any Liens due to Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable). No written
claim has been received by, or communicated in writing to, PinnOak from a
Taxing authority in a jurisdiction where PinnOak or any Subsidiary does not
file Tax Returns contending that PinnOak or any such Subsidiary is or may be
subject to Tax in such jurisdiction.

ARTICLE V

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER_

Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Selling Unit Holders as
follows:

Section 5.1 _Organization and Authority_. Purchaser is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Ohio. Purchaser has all necessary corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement, to carry out its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to purchase, own
and hold the Units and to pay the Purchase Price. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Purchaser, the performance by Purchaser of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action on the part of Purchaser. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Purchaser, and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Selling Unit Holders and PinnOak) this Agreement constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against
Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject,
as to enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

Section 5.2 _No Conflict_. Assuming all consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions described in _Section 5.3_ have been
obtained, and except as may result from any facts or circumstances relating
solely to PinnOak or the Selling Unit Holders, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Purchaser and the consummation by Purchaser
of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) violate or
conflict with the articles of incorporation or code of regulations of
Purchaser, (b) conflict with or violate, in any material respect, any Law or
Governmental  



 

35 _CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL HAS BEEN_

_OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE_

_SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION._

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 Order applicable to Purchaser, or (c) result in a material breach of, or
constitute a material default (or event which with the giving of notice
or lapse of time, or both, would become a material default) under, or give to
any Person any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any
of the assets or properties of Purchaser or pursuant to, any Contract to
which Purchaser is a party or by which any of their respective assets or
properties are bound.

Section 5.3 _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Purchaser do not, and the performance of this Agreement by
Purchaser will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or other
action by, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority or
Person, except (a) the notification requirements of the HSR Act and foreign
antitrust and competition law requirements, (b) where failure to obtain such
consent, approval, authorization or action, or to make such filing or
notification, would not prevent Purchaser from performing any of its material
obligations under this Agreement, or (c) as may be necessary as a result of
any facts or circumstances relating solely to PinnOak or its Affiliates.

Section 5.4 _Legal Proceedings_. As of the date hereof, there are no
Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against,
relating to or affecting Purchaser or any of its assets and properties which
would reasonably be expected to result in the issuance of a Governmental Order
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.5 _Purchase for Investment; Ability to Evaluate Risk_.

(a) The Units will be acquired by Purchaser (or, if applicable, its
assignee pursuant to _Section 10.6_) for its own account for the purpose of
investment, it being understood that the right to dispose of such Units shall
be entirely within the discretion of Purchaser (or such assignee, as the case
may be). Purchaser (or such assignee, as the case may be) will refrain from
transferring or otherwise disposing of any of the Units, or any interest
therein, in such manner as to cause PinnOak to be in violation of the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or applicable state securities
or blue sky laws.

(b) Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of holding the Units for
an indefinite period, and has knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters such that it is capable of evaluating the risks of the
investment in the Units.

Section 5.6 _Capital Adequacy; Solvency_. Purchaser represents that
immediately after the sale of the Units and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, Purchaser (and any successor corporation) will have a
positive net worth (calculated in accordance with GAAP) and will not be
insolvent (as defined under the federal  



 

36 _CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL HAS BEEN_

_OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE_

_SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION._

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 Bankruptcy Code (the " _Bankruptcy Code_ ") and in equity) and that the
purchase of the Units and any borrowing by Purchaser in connection with such
transactions will not have the effect of hindering, delaying or defrauding any
creditors of Purchaser (or any successor corporation). Purchaser further
represents that, based on the information provided to it by PinnOak to date,
the Purchase Price is a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the
Units.

Section 5.7 _Brokers_. Except for Hill Street Capital LLC, no broker,
finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other
fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser.
Purchaser is solely responsible for the fees and expenses of Hill Street
Capital LLC.

Section 5.8 _Availability of Funds_. Purchaser currently has sufficient
immediately available funds in cash or cash equivalents and will at the
Closing have sufficient immediately available funds, in cash, to pay the
Purchase Price and to pay any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
and to effect the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.9 _Due Diligence; Reliance on Experts_.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own inquiry
and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, PinnOak and the Subsidiaries and, in connection with such
inquiries and investigations, Purchaser has relied on its own financial, legal
and other experts and advisors in arriving at Purchasers decision to execute,
deliver and consummate this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Purchaser is not relying on any representations and warranties of
PinnOak (including, without limitation, any reserve estimates, projections or
information) except as expressly set forth in _Article IV_ of this
Agreement. 

(b) In connection with Purchasers investigation of PinnOak, Purchaser
has received from PinnOak certain estimates, projections and other forecasts
for the business of PinnOak, and certain plan and budget information.
Purchaser acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, that
Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties, that Purchaser is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to
it. For the avoidance of doubt, without limiting the generality of _Section
4.21_, except as provided herein, PinnOak makes no representation or warranty
with respect to any estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or budgets
referred to in this _Section 5.9_ other than to the capital expenditure
budget to the extent referenced in _Sections 4.6(e)(iii) and 6.1(f)(v)_
herein.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause each Employee
(as defined below) as of the Closing Date to be given full credit for all
service with PinnOak or any Subsidiary (and any predecessor entity, to the
extent PinnOak or a Subsidiary gives service credit for service with such
predecessor entity) before the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under any employee benefit plans or arrangements of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates in which the Employee participates on or after the
Closing Date other than the Purchasers retiree medical plans, to the same
extent such service is recognized by PinnOak immediately prior to the Closing
Date (except to the extent that the crediting of such service would result in
duplication of benefits). In the event an Employee shall participate in any
employee welfare benefit plans of Purchaser or its Affiliates (the "
_Purchaser Welfare Plans_ ") in the calendar year containing the Closing Date,
and such participation commences other than at the expiration of the plan year
under the corresponding welfare benefit plan maintained for the Employee by
PinnOak or any Subsidiary immediately prior to such participation (the "
_PinnOak Welfare Plans_ "), Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
(i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to the Employee under the Purchaser Welfare Plans, other
than to the extent limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect
with respect to the Employee under the PinnOak Welfare Plans have not been
satisfied as of such participation date, and (ii) provide each

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 Employee with credit for any co-insurance and deductibles paid in the
calendar year of the Closing prior to such participation date in satisfying
any deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Purchaser Welfare
Plans.

(b) For a period of six months immediately following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall provide, or to cause to be provided, to each Employee who is
not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, employee benefit and
compensation programs that are no less favorable than those provided to such
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, other than with respect to
the Purchasers retiree medical plan. Except as specifically provided in this
_Section 6.5_, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require
Purchaser to retain any employees it hires for any period of time, in any
particular position, at any particular compensation rate or with any
particular rights or benefits. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as requiring Purchaser to make an offer of employment on any basis other than
an employment-at-will basis.

(c) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume PinnOaks obligations
under each of the agreements set forth in _Section 6.5(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule_ and shall execute such documents and take such actions as may be
necessary to effectuate such assumption pursuant to the terms of such
agreements.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Employee_ " means all of the
following: (i) all persons who are active employees on the Closing Date,
including employees on vacation and employees on a regularly scheduled day
off from work (Employees on temporary leave for purposes of jury or annual
two-week national service/military duty shall be deemed to be active
employees); (ii) employees who on the Closing Date are on non-medical leave
of absence; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such employee shall be guaranteed
reinstatement to active service if his return to employment is contrary to the
terms of his leave, unless otherwise required by applicable Law (for
purposes of the foregoing, non-medical leave of absence shall include
maternity or paternity leave, leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993, educational leave, military leave with veterans reemployment rights
under federal Law, or personal leave, unless any of such is determined to be
a medical leave); and (iii) employees who on the Closing Date are on
disability or medical leave and for whom it has been one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days or less since their last day of active employment; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such employee shall be guaranteed reinstatement to active
service if he is incapable of working in accordance with the policies,
practices and procedures of Purchaser.

Section 6.6 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser
shall be responsible for the timely payment of all sales (including bulk
sales), use, value added, documentary, stamp, gross receipts, registration,
transfer, conveyance, excise, recording, license and other similar taxes and
fees arising out of or in connection with or attributable to the transactions
effected pursuant to this Agreement (" _Transfer_  



 

42 _CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL HAS BEEN_

_OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE_

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

  _Taxes_ "). Purchaser shall prepare and in a timely manner file all Tax
Returns in respect of Transfer Taxes. Purchaser and the Selling Unit
Holders shall reasonably cooperate with each other in attempting to minimize
Transfer Taxes.

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
all Tax Returns for each of PinnOak and the Subsidiaries for all periods
ending after the Closing Date, which Tax Returns shall be consistent with past
practice. In the case of Tax Returns for periods starting on or before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "),
Purchaser shall provide the Sellers Representative with an opportunity to
review and comment on such Tax Returns no less than thirty (30) days prior to
the due date thereof. Purchaser shall make, or cause to be made, any changes
to such Tax Returns reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative so long
as none of such changes result in any additional material Taxes to Purchaser,
PinnOak or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates. The Sellers Representative
shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by PinnOak and the Subsidiaries for all periods
ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Period_ "). As soon as
practicable, but in any event within fifteen (15) days after the Selling
Representatives or Purchasers request, as the case may be, Purchaser
shall deliver to the Selling Representative or the Selling Representative
shall deliver to Purchaser, as the case may be, such information and other
data relating to the Tax Returns and Taxes of PinnOak and the Subsidiaries and
shall provide such other assistance as may reasonably be requested, to cause
the completion and filing of all Tax Returns or to respond to audits by any
taxing authorities with respect to any Tax Returns or taxable periods or to
otherwise enable the Selling Representative, Purchaser or PinnOak, or their
respective subsidiaries to satisfy their accounting or Tax requirements.

(c) Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
all Tax Returns for QPII-AIV for all periods ending after the Closing Date,
which Tax Returns shall be consistent with past practice. In the case of Tax
Returns for Straddle Periods, Purchaser shall provide Questor with an
opportunity to review and comment on such Tax Returns no less than thirty (30)
days prior to the due date thereof. Purchaser shall make, or cause to be
made, any changes to such Tax Returns reasonably requested by Questor so long
as none of such changes result in any additional material Taxes to Purchaser,
PinnOak or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates. In order to apportion
Taxes of QPII-AIV with respect to a Straddle Period, the parties shall, to
the extent permitted under applicable Tax Law, elect to treat for all purposes
the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year of QPII-AIV. In any case
where applicable Tax Law does not permit QPII-AIV to treat the Closing Date
as the last day of the taxable year or period, the portion of any Taxes that
are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing (the
" _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ") shall be deemed: (i) in the case of Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis (and not based on invoices, sales,
receipts, income, payments or similar amounts), to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of  



 

43 _CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL HAS BEEN_

_OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE_

_SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION._

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Year; and (ii) in the case of
Taxes not described in _clause (i)_ (such as taxes based upon or related to
invoices, sales, receipts or income), an amount that would be payable if the
taxable year or period ended at the Closing. Questor shall prepare and file,
or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by
QPII-AIV for all Pre-Closing Periods. As soon as practicable, but in any
event within fifteen (15) days after Questors or Purchasers request, as the
case may be, Purchaser shall deliver to Questor or Questor shall deliver to
Purchaser, as the case may be, such information and other data relating to
the Tax Returns and Taxes of QPII-AIV and shall provide such other assistance
as may reasonably be requested, to cause the completion and filing of all Tax
Returns or to respond to audits by any taxing authorities with respect to any
Tax Returns or taxable periods or to otherwise enable the Blocker Parties,
QPII-AIV, Purchaser or PinnOak, or their respective subsidiaries to satisfy
their accounting or Tax requirements.

Section 6.7 _Insurance and Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause PinnOak to continue
to indemnify and hold harmless each of PinnOaks and the Subsidiaries
present and former directors, officers, Employees and agents, in their
capacities as such, from and against all damages, costs and expenses actually
incurred or suffered in connection with any threatened or pending Action at
law or in equity relating to the business of PinnOak (including actions
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby) or the
status of such individual as a director, officer, Employee or agent at or
prior to the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.
Purchaser shall cause PinnOak to retain in the certificate of formation or
operating agreement of PinnOak and each Subsidiary any indemnification
provision or provisions in effect as of the date hereof for the benefit of
PinnOaks and the Subsidiaries officers, directors, Employees and agents that
existed immediately prior to Closing and during the time period prior to
Closing, and not thereafter amend the same with respect to such persons
(except to the extent that such amendment preserves, increases or broadens the
indemnification or other rights theretofore available to such officers,
directors, Employees and agents).

(b) For six years from the Closing, Purchaser shall cause to be
maintained in effect an officers and directors liability insurance and
indemnification policy, with an insurer with a Standard and Poors rating of at
least A that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Closing covering each Person currently covered by such insurance policies
held by or for the benefit of PinnOak and the Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, Employees and agents on terms with respect to
coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those of such policies in
effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing Insurance_ "). Purchaser
shall satisfy its obligations under this _Section 6.7(b)_ by purchasing a
"tail" policy from an insurer with a Standard and Poors rating of at least A,
which (i) has an effective term of six years from the Closing, (ii) covers
each Person currently covered by the Existing Insurance for  



 

44 _CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL HAS BEEN_

_OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE_

_SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION._

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing and (iii)
contains terms that are no less favorable than those of the Existing
Insurance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be obligated to
make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums
exceed 200% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof for such
insurance (the " _Current Premium_ "). If such premium for such insurance
required to be maintained pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_ would at any time
exceed 200% of the Current Premium, then Purchaser shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in its good faith determination,
provide the maximum dollar loss coverage available at an annual premium equal
to 200% of the Current Premium.

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. For the period from the date hereof
until one year immediately following the Closing, the Selling Unit Holders and
Purchaser shall consult with each other and will mutually agree upon any
press release or public announcement pertaining to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement prior to such consultation and agreement,
except as may be required by applicable Law, Governmental Authority or stock
exchange rule in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or
make such public announcement shall consult in good faith with the other
party before issuing any such press release or making any such public
announcement.

Section 6.9 _Affiliate Transactions_. Immediately prior to the Closing
and except as set forth in _Section 6.9 of the Disclosure Schedule_, all
Indebtedness and other amounts owing under Contracts between the Selling Unit
Holders or any officer, Employee, director or Affiliate of the Selling Unit
Holders (other than PinnOak and the Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and
PinnOak or any Subsidiary, on the other hand, will be paid in full, and the
Selling Unit Holders will terminate and will cause any such officer, Employee,
director or Affiliate of the Selling Unit Holders to terminate each such
Contract with PinnOak or such Subsidiary, as applicable (except for
employment arrangements of PinnOak or any Subsidiary for compensation and
employee benefits for services performed).

Section 6.10 _Beard-Pinnacle Facilities_. PinnOak and the Selling Unit
Holders agree that, in the event the sale of the Beard-Pinnacle facilities is
consummated prior to the Closing, the proceeds of the sale, including any
repayment of Indebtedness owed by Beard-Pinnacle, LLC to PinnOak, will
promptly be applied by PinnOak to reduce amounts outstanding under the Credit
Facility. In the event the sale of the Beard-Pinnacle facilities is
not consummated prior to the Closing, the Selling Unit Holders will cause all
of the outstanding equity interests in Beard-Pinnacle, LLC (other than the
equity interests held by QPII-AIV) to be contributed to PinnOak prior to the
Closing.

Section 6.11 _Further Action_. For a period of twelve (12) months from
and after the Closing Date, each of the parties hereto shall execute and
deliver such documents and other papers and take such further actions as may
be reasonably required

_SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION._

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and give effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.12 _No Solicitation_. PinnOak agrees that neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use all reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives not to (and shall not authorize any of them to) directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries with respect to, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any offer or proposal for an Alternative Proposal; (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any nonpublic information with respect to, any Alternative Proposal;
(iii) engage in discussions with any Person with respect to any Alternative
Proposal, except as to the existence of these provisions; (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal; or (v) enter into any letter
of intent or similar document or any contract agreement or commitment
contemplating any Alternative Proposal or transaction contemplated thereby.
PinnOak and its Subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Alternative Proposal. As promptly as
practicable after receipt of any Alternative Proposal or any request
for nonpublic information or inquiry which it reasonably believes would lead
to an Alternative Proposal, PinnOak shall provide Purchaser with oral and
written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making
any such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry.

the Purchasers right to set-off the Deferred Payment pursuant to and in
accordance with  _Section 8.6(a)_ and, with respect to any other claim made

right first to set-off the Deferred Payment with any balance to be funded
by Purchasers right to set-off the Earnout Payment pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 8.6(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
the aggregate amount of Losses the Purchaser Indemnified Parties would be
entitled to set-off in accordance with the terms of the Selling Unit Holders
indemnification obligations under this _Article VIII_ exceeds the amount of
the Deferred Payment plus the amount of the Earnout Payment that is earned by
the Selling Unit Holders, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will have no
recourse against the Selling Unit Holders other than to set-off against the
aggregate amount of the

performance (or nonperformance) or breach (including any inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty) by a Selling Unit Holder or PinnOak of this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule or any other document referenced herein
for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party may assert any other right to
indemnification, hold harmless, reimbursement, defense, contribution, payment
or recovery from a Selling Unit Holder, PinnOak or any of their respective
Affiliates (whether under this Agreement or under any Law or otherwise) other

and agrees not to assert such right, and Purchaser agrees to cause each other

") for and against any and all Losses, arising out of or resulting from:

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser

(i) unless the Purchaser Indemnified Party has given the Selling Unit

Indemnifying Party") a Claim Notice with respect to such claim (x) prior to
the applicable Cut-Off Date and (y) in any event prior to the Earnout Due
Date;

(ii) if any Loss suffered or arising in connection with such claim is less
than $100,000 from any single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the
same facts, events or circumstances (a " _Covered Loss_ ");

million dollars ($10,000,000) (the " _Basket_ "), in which event the Selling
Unit Holder Indemnifying Parties shall be liable solely for the amount of the
Covered Losses and such indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _clause (ix)_ of 
_Section 8.2(a_) that are in excess of the Basket and, solely in the case of
Covered Losses, less than the Indemnity Cap; and

(iv) to the extent that the total of all such Losses (subject to the

shall exceed twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) (the " _Indemnity Cap_
"); _provided_ that the limitations contained in _Sections 8.4(a)(i), (ii)

Holder for claims under this _Article VIII_ shall be, with respect to claims

pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 8.6(a)_ and, with respect to any
other claim made under _Section 8.2(a), (b) or (c)_, exclusively funded by
the Purchasers right first to set-off the Deferred Payment with any balance
to be funded by Purchasers right to set-off the Earnout Payment pursuant to

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that the indemnity obligations of
each Selling Unit Holder pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(iii) and (iv)_ and of

 except for claims based on fraud, in each case will be funded solely and
exclusively by the Purchasers right first to set-off the Deferred

Purchasers right to set-off the Earnout Payment payable to such Selling Unit
Holder pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 8.6(a)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for
purposes of this _Article VIII_ , in determining the amount of Losses

warranties shall be disregarded; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply with respect to _Sections 4.6(a), (c) and (d)(v)_ above.

Section 8.5 _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_.

(a) An Indemnified Party shall promptly, and in any event within thirty
(30) calendar days, or, in the case of any Third Party Claim, within ten (10)
calendar days, after the Indemnified Party has in good faith determined that
an event has occurred that would be reasonably expected to give rise to a
right of indemnification under this _Article VIII_ , notify the Indemnifying
Party in writing of the matter that the Indemnified Party has in good faith
determined gives rise or is reasonably expected to give rise to such right of
indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or threatened
claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such
claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), stating the amount of the Loss, if
known, and method of computation thereof, describing in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances with respect to such matter and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right
of indemnification is claimed or arises (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article VIII_ with
respect to Third Party Claims except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
is prejudiced by such failure. Anything in this _Article VIII_ to the
contrary notwithstanding, notices for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered before the
expiration of the survival period, if any, for such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement as specified in _Section 8.1_ (the " _Cut-off Date_ ")
or, in any event, on or prior to Earnout Due Date.

(b) At any time after the receipt of a Claim Notice from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section 8.5(a)_ regarding a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such
Third Party Claim with all expenses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party
(solely, in the case of indemnification by the Selling Unit Holders, through
the Purchasers right to set-off the Deferred Payment and Earnout Payment
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this _Article VIII_ ) and
through counsel of its choice (after consultation with the Indemnified Party)
if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party and the
proceeding or claim involves money damages and not an injunction or other
equitable

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 relief that could have an adverse effect on PinnOak or the Subsidiaries and
the Indemnifying Party irrevocably acknowledges in writing its liability to
the Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_ and agrees to indemnify the
Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ ; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim promptly but in no event later than twenty (20) days
after its receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to such Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse (solely, in the case of
indemnification by the Selling Unit Holders, through the Purchasers right to
set-off the Deferred Payment and Earnout Payment pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms of this _Article VIII_ ) the Indemnified Partys reasonable
expenses incurred in the defense of such Third Party Claim prior to the date
the Indemnifying Party ultimately does assume such defense; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict
of interest that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of
the Indemnified Party for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to retain its own counsel, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (solely,
in the case of indemnification by the Selling Unit Holders, through the
Purchasers right to set-off the Deferred Payment and Earnout Payment pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of this _Article VIII_ ). If the
Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against
any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party has exercised such right, the Indemnified Party shall make
available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense
(solely, in the case of indemnification by the Selling Unit Holders, through
the Purchasers right to set-off the Deferred Payment and Earnout Payment
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this _Article VIII_ ), all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials, and information in the Indemnified
Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto
as is reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event
the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense
against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the
Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense (solely, in the case of
indemnification by the Selling Unit Holders, through the Purchasers right to
set-off the Deferred Payment and Earnout Payment pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms of this _Article VIII_ ), all such witnesses, records,
materials and information in the Indemnifying Partys possession or under the
Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnified Party; and in such event, the Indemnified Party shall consult
with, and give due consideration to the advice of, the Indemnifying Party
as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party regarding the
defense of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
_Article VIII_ , the Indemnifying Party shall not have the obligation to
indemnify any Loss with respect to a Third Party Claim for which the
Indemnified Party is conducting the defense if the Indemnified Party has
failed to consult with the Indemnifying Party after the Indemnifying Party has
requested, in writing, such consultation regarding such Third Party Claim. No
such Third Party Claim may be settled by the Indemnified Party without



 

55 _CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL HAS BEEN_

_OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE_

_SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION._

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed); _provided_ , that, if the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may provide such consent under reservation of rights with
respect to any obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Losses
resulting from such Third Party Claim.

Section 8.6 _Set-Off Rights_.

(a) Any payments required to be made to Purchaser or a Purchaser Indemnified
Party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , except payments for claims based on
fraud, shall be, with respect to claims made solely under _clauses (i) and
(ii)_ of _Section 8.2(a)_, solely and exclusively funded by the Purchasers
right to set-off the Deferred Payment and, with respect to any other claim
made under _Section 8.2(a), (b) or (c)_, exclusively funded by the
Purchasers right first to set-off the Deferred Payment with any balance to be
funded by Purchasers right to set-off the Earnout Payment. If (i) the
Selling Unit Holder Indemnifying Party shall not have objected to the amount
claimed by a Purchaser Indemnified Party for indemnification with respect to
any Loss or (ii) the Selling Unit Holder Indemnifying Party shall
have delivered notice of its disagreement as to the amount of any
indemnification requested by such Purchaser Indemnified Party and either (A)
the Selling Unit Holder Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and, Purchaser,
on the other hand, shall have, subsequent to the giving of such notice,
mutually agreed that the Selling Unit Holder Indemnifying Party is obligated
to indemnify such Purchaser Indemnified Party, as the case may be, for a
specified amount or (B) a final nonappealable award shall have been issued by
the court having jurisdiction over the matters relating to such claim by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party for indemnification from the Selling Unit Holder
Indemnifying Party, Purchaser shall, subject to the limitations contained in
this _Article VIII_ , have the right to set-off against Purchasers payment
obligations with respect to the Deferred Payment the amount determined to be
owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_  (any such
amount, a " _DP Setoff Amount_ ") and, in the event that the aggregate amount
determined to be owed to all Purchaser Indemnified Parties under this _Article
VIII_ exceeds $112,500,000, Purchaser shall have the right, for claims other
than under _clauses (i) and (ii)_ of _Section 8.2(a)_ and subject to the
other limitations contained in this _Article VIII_ , to set-off against
Purchasers payment obligations with respect to the Earnout Payment such
excess amount determined to be owed to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under
this _Article VIII_ (any such excess amount, a " _EO Setoff Amount_ " and
collectively with the DP Setoff Amount, the " _Setoff Amount_ "), in each
case pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
_Article VIII_. With respect to any claim for indemnification requested by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party prior to the applicable Cut-Off Date or, in any
event, the Earnout Due Date which is not finally resolved pursuant to clause
(i) or (ii) of the immediately proceeding sentence as of the due date of the
Deferred Payment or Earnout Payment, as applicable, Purchaser shall have the
right to withhold from the amount of the Deferred Payment or Earnout Payment,
as applicable, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such disputed
claims; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amounts

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 withheld shall accrue interest pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
of _Section 2.2(c)(iv)_ (with respect to amounts withheld from the Deferred
Payment) or _Section 2.3(l)_ (with respect to amounts withheld from the
Earnout Payment), as applicable.

(i) In the case of any amount of indemnity determined to be payable as a
result of any claim in respect of a Loss arising under _clause (i), (ii), (v),
(vi), (vii), (viii) or (ix)_ of  _Section 8.2(a)_ or _clause (i)_ of
_Section 8.2(b)_, the Setoff Amount shall be setoff against the Deferred
Payment and Earnout Payment, if applicable, payable to all of the Selling Unit
Holders pro rata based on each Selling Unit Holders Ownership Percentage
(subject, in case of claims in respect of a Loss arising under _clauses (i)
and (ii) and (ix)_ of _Section 8.2(a)_, to the limitations contained in 
_Section 8.4(a)_).

(ii) In the case of any amount of indemnity determined to be payable as a
result of any claim in respect of a Loss arising under _clause (iii) or (iv)_
of _Section 8.2(a)_, the Setoff Amount shall be setoff solely against the
Deferred Payment and Earnout Payment, if applicable, payable to the breaching
Selling Unit Holder responsible for such claim.

(iii) In the case of any amount of indemnity determined to be payable as a
result of any claim in respect of a Loss arising under _clause (ii)_ of
_Section 8.2(b)_, the Setoff Amount shall be setoff solely against the amount
of the Deferred Payment and Earnout Payment, if applicable, payable to the
Questor Members and the Blocker Parties pro rata amongst the Questor Members
and the Blocker Parties based on their Ownership Percentage.

(iv) In the case of any amount of indemnity determined to be payable as a
result of any claim in respect of a Loss arising under _clause (iii)_ of
_Section 8.2(b)_, the Setoff Amount shall be setoff solely against the amount
of the Deferred Payment and Earnout Payment, if applicable, payable to Regent.

(v) In the case of any amount of indemnity determined to be payable as a
result of any claim in respect of a Loss arising under _Section 8.2(c)_, the
Setoff Amount shall be setoff solely against the amount of the Deferred
Payment and Earnout Payment, if applicable, payable to the Blocker Parties.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that the right of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ shall expire on the

_SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION._

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 Earnout Due Date and, other than with respect to claims validly pending as
of such date in accordance with _Section 8.6(a)_, no amounts shall be owed
by the Selling Unit Holders after the Earnout Due Date (whether by setoff or
otherwise).

Section 8.7 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to
Losses for which indemnification is provided under this _Article VIII_ , (a)
each Loss shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis, (b) all Losses shall be
net of any third-party insurance proceeds that have been or are subsequently
recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to
the right of indemnification (and if subsequently recovered shall be promptly
delivered to the Indemnifying Party), and (c) in no event shall the
Indemnifying Party have liability to the Indemnified Party for any
consequential, special, incidental, indirect, or punitive damages, lost
revenue, profits or income, diminution in value of securities, loss of
business reputation, or opportunity or similar items (except, in each case, to
the extent awarded or assessed against the Indemnified Party in connection
with a Third Party Claim pursuant to a final and non-appealable Governmental
Order or award of an arbitrator, arbitration panel, or similar adjudicative
body). In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any
amount in respect of a matter for which an Indemnifying Party has indemnified
it pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay
over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the amount of expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery),
but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously paid by the
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
claim and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or
defending any claim arising out of such matter. The obligations of the Selling
Unit Holder Indemnifying Parties to indemnify and hold harmless any Purchaser
Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_ , to the extent applicable, shall
terminate as of the Cut-Off Date of the representation, warranty or covenant
pursuant to _Section 8.1_; _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as
to which any Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have, before such Cut-Off Date,
previously made a claim by delivering a Claim Notice with respect to such
claim pursuant to _Section 8.5_ to the Selling Unit Holders.

Section 8.8 _Mitigation of Damages_. Purchaser shall take and shall
cause its Affiliates (including PinnOak after the Closing) to take
commercially reasonable steps, excluding the payment of any material fees,
costs or expenses, to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event
that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise to Losses.
The Indemnified Parties shall take commercially reasonable steps, excluding
the payment of any material fees, costs or expenses, to mitigate any Losses
upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or
does, give rise Losses. If any amounts recovered or recoverable under
insurance policies or other collateral sources (including the Asset Purchase
Agreement, dated as of May 23, 2003, by and among PinnOak, Pinnacle Mining
Company, LLC, Pinnacle Land Company, LLC, U.S. Steel Mining Company, LLC and
United States Steel Corporation, which the Purchaser and PinnOak, after the
Closing, agree to use

 commercially reasonable efforts to enforce) are not received before any
claim for indemnification is paid pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , then
the Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to pursue
such insurance policies or collateral sources, and if the Indemnified Parties
receive any recovery, the amount of such recovery shall be applied first, to
reimburse the Indemnified Parties for their out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) expended in pursuing such recovery,
second, to refund any payments made by the Indemnifying Parties which would
not have been so paid had such recovery been obtained before such payment to
the extent that such recovery, together with any indemnification payment by
the Indemnifying Party, exceeds the applicable Losses related to such claim,
and third, any excess to the Indemnified Parties. The Indemnified Parties
shall assign or otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties
to pursue any claims against, or otherwise recover amounts from, any Person
liable or responsible for any Losses for which indemnification has
been received pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 8.9 _Pending Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement:

(a) During the period commencing as of the Closing Date and expiring on
the Earnout Due Date (or earlier with respect to a given Pending Matter if
such Pending Matter is resolved earlier in accordance with the terms hereof)
(the " _Litigation Period_ "), the Selling Unit Holders shall control
the proceedings involving the current subject matter of the Actions described
in _paragraphs 1 and 3 of Section 4.7 of the Disclosure Schedule_ (the "
_Pending Matters_ ") by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will
be handled with due care by the Selling Unit Holders to a final judgment or
will be settled at the discretion of the Selling Unit Holders (but only with
the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, in the case of any settlement that provides for (a) an injunction
or other equitable relief that would have an adverse effect on PinnOak or the
Subsidiaries or (b) the payment of monetary damages in excess of the aggregate
amount of the Deferred Payment and Earnout Payment). The Selling Unit Holders
will have full control of such proceedings, including (except as provided in
the immediately preceding sentence) any settlement thereof. For the avoidance
of doubt, PinnOak shall bear the costs and expenses incurred by it in
connection with the Pending Matters, including the costs and expenses of
PinnOaks current counsel (or any replacement counsel) which represents
PinnOak in the Pending Matters, subject to the control of the Selling Unit
Holders as provided in this _Section 8.9(a)_; _provided_ that such costs and
expenses will be counted towards the Basket under _Section 8.4(a)(iii)_ and
the Selling Unit Holders shall indemnify Purchaser, by way of a set-off right
under _Section 8.6(a)_, for any such fees incurred after the aggregate amount
of Covered Losses (including such fees) exceed the amount of the Basket.
Purchaser may retain separate counsel to represent it in, but not control,
any defense or settlement of a Pending Matter pursuant to this _Section
8.9(a)_, and Purchaser will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
such separate counsel; _provided_ that such fees will be counted towards
the Basket under _Section 8.4(a)(iii)_ and the Selling Unit Holders

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 shall indemnify Purchaser, by way of a set-off right under _Section
8.6(a)_, for any such fees incurred after the aggregate amount of
Covered Losses (including such fees) exceeds the amount of the Basket.

(b) During the Litigation Period, Purchaser will cooperate, and will cause
PinnOak, the Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives to
cooperate, with the reasonable requests of the Selling Unit Holders and their
counsel to assist in the defense of the Pending Matters, including, without
limitation, by providing reasonable access to the books, records and other
data relating to the business of PinnOak and the Subsidiaries and the right to
make copies and extracts, at the Selling Unit Holders expense, therefrom and
to make available (including for purposes of meetings, interviews,
depositions or hearings regarding the Pending Matters) all personnel
reasonably necessary (and to schedule any such meetings, interviews,
depositions or hearings, if possible, at such times as are reasonably
convenient for such personnel and to minimize interference with the ongoing
business of PinnOak and the Subsidiaries) and any other information in order
to fulfill the Selling Unit Holders obligations under this  _Section 8.9_.
During the Litigation Period, Purchaser, PinnOak and the Subsidiaries shall
execute any reasonably necessary documentation in order to evidence the
authority of the Selling Unit Holders pursuant to the terms hereof, including
any required limited powers-of-attorney.

Section 8.10 _Nature of Payments_. Any indemnity payments made under
this _Article VIII_ shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment of the
Purchase Price.

ARTICLE IX

to perform or comply with any of its material covenants or agreements
contained herein, or (ii) breaches its representations or warranties in any
material respect and such breach would materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case such that
the condition set forth in _Sections 7.3(a)_ or _(b)_ would not be satisfied
(a " _Terminating Purchaser Breach_ "); _provided_ , that if such Terminating

efforts, and Purchaser continues to exercise such best efforts, PinnOak may
not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)_;

(c) by Purchaser, if the Selling Unit Holders or PinnOak (i) breach or fail

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 covenants or agreements contained herein, or (ii) breaches their
representations or warranties in any material respect and such breach would
have a Material Adverse Effect, in each case such that the condition set
forth in _Section 7.2(a), (b), (d) or (e)_ would not be satisfied (a "
_Terminating Sellers Breach_ "); provided that, if such Terminating
Sellers Breach is curable by the Selling Unit Holders and PinnOak through the
exercise of their best efforts, and the Selling Unit Holders and PinnOak
continue to exercise such best efforts, Purchaser may not terminate this
Agreement under this  _Section 9.1(c)_;

(d) by any party hereto, if the Closing shall not have occurred prior
to August 31, 2007; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that, as of

been satisfied or waived (other than such conditions that say their terms
are satisfied at the Closing) other than the condition set forth in _Section
7.1(a)_, the termination date may be extended from time to time at the option
of the Sellers Representative by up to an aggregate of sixty (60) days;
_provided further_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 9.1(d)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of,
or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such
date; or

(e) by any party hereto, in the event of the issuance of a Governmental
Order (which Governmental Order the parties hereto shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to lift) restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the transactions contemplated herein and such Governmental Order having been
made final and non-appealable.

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto,
except as set forth in _Section 6.3_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any breach by
such party of any covenant set forth in this Agreement; provided, further,
that the obligations of the parties set forth in _Article X_  hereof shall
survive any such termination.

Section 9.3 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any party may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound
thereby. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any term or provision
of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

Section 9.4 _Reimbursement of Purchaser Expenses_. In the event that
this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ and
the Selling Unit Holders enter into an agreement in respect of and consummate
within twelve (12) months

Section 10.3 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Selling
Unit Holders, PinnOak and Purchaser with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Section 10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other party, except that Purchaser may, without such prior
written consent, at any time, transfer or assign its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement (i) to one or more of its Affiliates,
provided that any such Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by all of the
terms, conditions and provisions herein, but no such assignment referred to
in clause (i) shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder or (ii) as
part of a collateral assignment to any lender of Purchaser. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

Section 10.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly
provided herein, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto
and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

Section 10.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the Selling Unit
Holders, PinnOak and Purchaser specifically referencing this Agreement.

Section 10.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that

 performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any
other remedy at law or equity, without the necessity of demonstrating the
inadequacy of money damages.

Section 10.10 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement
shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts to be made and performed entirely therein
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any
other jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto hereby expressly and
irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of
any other competent court of the State of Delaware located in New Castle
County (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ "), preserving, however, all
rights of removal to such federal court under 28 U.S.C. Section 1441, in
connection with all disputes arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and agrees not to commence
any litigation relating thereto except in such courts. If the
aforementioned courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction, then the
proceeding shall be brought in any other state or federal court located in the
State of Delaware, preserving, however, all rights of removal to such federal
court under 28 U.S.C. Section 1441\. Each party hereby waives the right to
any other jurisdiction or venue for any litigation arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to
which any of them may be entitled by reason of its present or future
domicile. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees
that each of the other parties shall have the right to bring any action or
proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by the Delaware Courts
in any other court or jurisdiction.

Section 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE SELLING UNIT HOLDERS, PINNOAK AND
PURCHASER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE
SELLING UNIT HOLDERS, PINNOAK OR PURCHASER IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

Section 10.12 _Appointment of Sellers Representative_.

(a) By virtue of approval and adoption of this Agreement, each Selling Unit
Holder hereby constitutes and appoints Regent (the " _Sellers Representative_
") as the sole, exclusive, true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-
in-fact, in such Selling Unit Holders name, place and stead, and on its
behalf, with respect to any and all matters relating to, arising out of, or
in connection with, _Section 2.3_ or _Section 6.6(a)-(b)_ of this Agreement.

(b) The Sellers Representative agrees to consult with and consider the
comments and suggestions of the Selling Unit Holders in connection with  



 

65 _CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL HAS BEEN_

_SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION._

_ASTERISKS DENOTE SUCH OMISSIONS._



 

 any actions to be taken by the Sellers Representative in its capacity as
Sellers Representative. The Sellers Representative acknowledges and agrees
to deliver to the Selling Unit Holders a copy of the Preliminary Earnings
Payment Statement promptly upon receipt from Purchaser and to afford the
Selling Unit Holders a reasonable opportunity to review, comment on and
consult with the Sellers Representative regarding such Preliminary Earnings
Payment Statement and any Dispute Notice before any disclosure or delivery
thereof to Purchaser.

(c) The Sellers Representative will not be liable to any Selling Unit Holder
for any action taken by it in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, and the
Selling Unit Holders will severally indemnify the Sellers Representative
against, and agree to hold the Sellers Representative harmless from, any and
all Losses. The Sellers Representative is serving in that capacity solely for
purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally liable in
such capacity for any of the obligations of the Selling Unit Holders
hereunder, and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties agree that they will not look
to the personal assets of the Sellers Representative, acting in such capacity,
for the satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the Selling Unit
Holders hereunder.

Section 10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

Section 10.14 _No Presumption_. This Agreement shall be construed without
regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation
against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.
