direct or indirect owners shall take a position on any Tax Return, or before
any Governmental Authority in connection with the examination of a Tax Return
or in any judicial proceeding, that is in any manner inconsistent with the
terms of the Allocation, except as required by applicable Law. In recognition
of the aggregate capital expenditures that have been incurred by Seller
associated with the tangible property included within the existing Sherwood
Gas Gathering and Compression System, the Parties agree that in no event will
the value allocated to the existing Sherwood Gas Gathering and Compression
System be less than $160,000,000.

duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and (b) has all requisite power and authority to own the Assets

or in the aggregate, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 2.2. _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Seller has all requisite

this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the

requisite limited liability company action on the part of Seller. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller and,
assuming this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
Buyer, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Seller, enforceable
against Seller in accordance with its terms, except that (a) such enforcement
may be subject to any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer or other Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to or
limiting creditors rights generally and (b) enforcement of this Agreement,

obligation to which Seller is a party or by which Seller or the Assets are
bound, (iii) violate any Laws applicable to Seller or the Assets, or (iv)
require any filing with, or the obtaining of any permit, authorization,
consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority that has not been made or
obtained, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this _Section
2.3(a)_ for any such violations, breaches, defaults, rights of termination,
cancellation or acceleration or requirements which, individually or in the
aggregate, (x) would not adversely affect the ability of Seller to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or result in a Seller Material Adverse
Effect or (y) would result from obtaining the Miscellaneous Consents after the
Closing.

 



 

(b) _Section 2.3(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule identifies with a single
asterisk all consents and other restrictions on assignment with respect to (i)
the Real Property Interests that are required (or would be applicable) in

conducted in violation of any applicable Law or any order, writ, injunction or

Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.5. _Availability of Funds_. Buyer has access to sufficient
immediately available funds to pay the Purchase Price and to pay any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement and to effect the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer is, and immediately after giving effect to the

ARTICLE V _ 
REAL PROPERTY MATTERS_

 



 

Section 5.1. _Real Property Consents_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall identify and list on _Schedule 2.3(b)_ , with respect to the
Assets, all Real Property Consents that would be applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the Closing, Seller will request
execution of all Real Property Consents. During such period in which the
applicable Asset is not capable of being assigned to Buyer due to the failure
to obtain an execution of a Real Property Consent, the Parties mutually agree,
as is reasonably practicable, to cooperate to obtain an execution of such Real
Property Consent or to make or cause to be made such arrangements as may be
reasonably necessary or requested by Buyer to enable Buyer to receive all the
economic benefits or same or similar rights with respect to such Asset.

 



 

(b) Real Property Interests with respect to which a Real Property Consent has
not been obtained on or before the day that is three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing shall be deemed to be excluded from the Assets conveyed to
Buyer at the Closing, but the Purchase Price shall not be reduced.

 



 

(c) With respect to any Real Property Interest upon which any Pipeline is
located, if, under the terms of such Real Property Interest, a Real Property
Consent is required prior to the assignment of such Real Property Interest to
Buyer and such Real Property Consent has not been obtained prior to the period
described in clause (b) above, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to convey at the Closing such Real Property Interest or the portions
of such Pipeline that are located upon such Real Property Interest. In such
case, the Parties may agree that (i) with respect to the portions of such
Pipeline not conveyed at the Closing (the " _Excluded Facilities_ "), the
Parties shall enter into an agreement, the form and substance of which shall
be mutually agreed to by the Parties, that provides Buyer, to the commercially
reasonable extent possible, with the rights, benefits and burdens with respect
to the Excluded Facilities that Buyer would have received had such Excluded
Facilities been conveyed to Buyer at the Closing and (ii) the other portions
of the Sherwood Gas Gathering and Compression System and the related Real
Property Interests shall be conveyed to Buyer at the Closing. With respect to
any portion of the Excluded Facilities and related Real Property Interests,
when the applicable Real Property Consents are obtained, Seller shall convey
the applicable portions of the Excluded Facilities and assign, pursuant to a
special warranty deed or assignment, such related Real Property Interests to
Buyer within ten (10) days following receipt of such Real Property Consent,
and any agreement entered into between the Parties with respect to such
portions of the Excluded Facilities shall terminate. During the term of any
such agreement, Seller shall not convey, or allow any Liens by, through, or
under Seller to attach to, the applicable portion of the Excluded Facilities
or the related Real Property Interests covered by such agreement.
Additionally, Buyer may terminate such agreement at any time by giving sixty
(60) days notice. At the

 



      
 

 



 

time of termination of such agreement, to the extent that the Seller may do so
if the requisite Real Property Consents have been obtained, Seller shall
convey to Buyer the remaining rights they may have in the Excluded Facilities
and, assign, to the extent related to the Sherwood Gas Gathering and
Compression System, the Real Property Interests pursuant to a special warranty
deed or assignment.

 



 

(d) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing, the Parties shall
continue to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Real
Property Consent that was not obtained prior to the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.2. _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees
that its sole and exclusive remedy for Sellers failure to obtain the Real
Property Consents as contemplated in _Section 5.1_, shall be as provided in
this _Article V_.

 



 

ARTICLE VI _ 
TAX MATTERS_

 



 

Section 6.1. _Preparation of Tax Returns_. Seller shall prepare and file (or
cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns with respect to the Assets for
all Pre-Closing Periods that are required to be filed after the Closing Date,
and shall pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes due with respect to the Assets
for all Pre-Closing Periods (whether or not such Taxes are required to be
shown on a Tax Return). Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared
and filed) all Tax Returns with respect to the Assets for all Straddle Periods
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include income Tax Returns of
the Seller), and shall pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes due with respect to
the Assets for all Straddle Periods (whether or not such Taxes are required to
be shown on a Tax Return but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including Income
Taxes of the Seller). At least twenty (20) days before the date on which each
such Straddle Period Tax Return is to be filed, Buyer shall provide to Seller
a copy of such Tax Return and a schedule calculating the portion of the Taxes
for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section 6.2_. Within ten (10)
days following its receipt of such Tax Return and schedule, Seller shall
notify Buyer whether it disagrees with any matter contained within such Tax
Return or schedule, and, if it does, the Parties shall in good faith discuss
and resolve such disagreement. Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer the portion
of such Tax for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section 6.2_ within
five (5) days after the determination of such portion pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 6.1_.

 



 

Section 6.2. _Responsibility for Taxes_. Seller shall be responsible for and
entitled to all refunds of, and shall indemnify Buyer Indemnitees from and
against, all Taxes which arise with respect to the Assets for any Pre-Closing
Period and for that portion of any Straddle Period that ends on the Closing
Date. Buyer shall be responsible for the remaining Straddle Period Taxes. For
this purpose, Straddle Period Taxes shall be (a) allocated on an interim
closing of the books method for all Taxes other than those described in clause
(b), and (b) prorated on a daily basis to the Closing Date for ad valorem and
real and personal property Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (i) any franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to the Assets shall
be allocated to the period during which the income, operations, assets or
capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the
right to do business for another Tax period is obtained by the payment of such
franchise Tax and (ii) any ad valorem or property

 



      
 

 



 

Taxes paid or payable with respect to the Assets shall be allocated to the Tax
period applicable to the ownership of the Assets regardless of when such Taxes
are assessed (for the avoidance of doubt, the Tax period applicable to the
ownership of the Assets shall be the assessment year for West Virginia
property Tax purposes, which is July 1st (the date on which ownership of the
Assets gives rise to liability for the property Taxes) through June 30th with
such property Taxes apportioned on a daily basis over such period even though
the Tax year is the subsequent calendar year).

 



 

Section 6.3. _Post-Closing Assistance_. Seller and Buyer will each provide the
other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return with respect to the Assets, or any Tax Audit by
any Tax Authority or any Proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to the
Assets, and each will retain and provide the requesting Party with any records
or information that may be reasonably relevant to such return, audit or
examination, proceedings or determination. The Party requesting assistance
will reimburse the other Party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (other
than salaries or wages of any employees of the Parties) incurred in providing
such assistance.

 



 

Section 6.4. _Conduct of Business_.

 



 

(a) From and after the applicable Closing Date, each of Buyer and Seller (the
" _Tax Indemnified Person_ "), shall notify the chief tax officer (or other
appropriate Person) of the other Party (the " _Tax Indemnifying Person_ "), in
writing within twenty (20) days of receipt by the Tax Indemnified Person of
written notice of any pending or threatened audits, adjustments, claims,
examinations, assessments or other proceedings (a " _Tax Audit_ ") which are
likely to affect the liability for Taxes of the Tax Indemnifying Person. If
the Tax Indemnified Person fails to give such timely notice to the Tax
Indemnifying Person, it shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes
arising in connection with such Tax Audit if such failure to give notice
materially adversely affects the Tax Indemnifying Persons right to
participate in the Tax Audit.

 



 

(b) If a Tax Audit relates solely to Taxes for which only Seller would be
liable to indemnify Buyer under this Agreement, Seller shall have the option,
at its expense, to control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit. If
Seller does not elect to control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit,
Buyer may, at Sellers expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax
Audit. If such Tax Audit relates solely to Taxes for which only Buyer would be
liable under this Agreement, Buyer shall, at its expense, control the defense
and settlement of such Tax Audit.

 



 

(c) If a Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which both Seller and Buyer could be
liable under this Agreement, to the extent practicable, the items of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit or other item required to be reported on or
otherwise reported on the applicable Tax Return (" _Tax Items_ ") with respect
to such Tax Audit will be distinguished and each Party will have the option to
control the defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable.
If such Tax Audit relates to a Straddle Period and any Tax Item cannot be
identified as

 



      
 

 



 

being a liability of only one Party or cannot be separated from a Tax Item for
which the other Party is liable, Seller, at its expense, shall have the option
to control the defense and settlement of the Tax Audit.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.4_, any Party
whose liability for Taxes may be affected by a Tax Audit shall be entitled to
participate at its expense in such defense and to employ counsel of its choice
at its expense and shall have the right to consent to any settlement of such
Tax Audit (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) to the extent that such settlement would have an adverse effect with
respect to a period for which that Party is liable for Taxes, under this
Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.5. _Post-Closing Actions_. Except to the extent required by
applicable Laws, Buyer shall not and shall not permit its Affiliates to amend
any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing or Straddle Period on or after the Closing
Date which could reasonably be expected to materially increase Sellers
liability to indemnify Buyer for Taxes under this Agreement without first
notifying and obtaining consent from Seller, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 6.6. _Refunds of Certain Taxes Received by Buyer_. Buyer and Seller
agree to pay to the other Party any refund received (whether by payment,
credit, offset or otherwise, and together with any interest thereon) after the
Closing Date by Buyer or Seller or any of their Affiliates that is entitled to
be paid to the other Party pursuant to _Section 6.2_. Buyer and Seller and
their Affiliates shall cooperate with the other Party and its Affiliates in
order to take all reasonably necessary steps to claim any such refund. Any
such refund received by Buyer or Seller or any of their Affiliates shall be
paid to the other Party within thirty (30) days after such refund is received.
Buyer and Seller agree to notify the other Party within ten (10) days
following the discovery of a right to claim any such refund and upon receipt
of any such refund. Buyer and Seller agree to furnish to the other Party all
information, records and assistance reasonably requested and necessary to
verify the amount of the refund or overpayment.

 



 

Section 6.7. _Transfer Taxes_. The Parties are not aware of any West Virginia
sales and use Tax that will be assessed or collected in connection with the
sale of the Assets and such taxes are not being collected in connection with
the sale of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement. Any sales, use, recording
or other transfer taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed on the purchase and
sale of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement (including any interest,
penalties, or additions to tax with respect thereto) shall be paid by [***].
The Parties shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the
extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any Transfer Taxes
described in this _Section 6.7_. The parties believe that for West Virginia
Transfer Tax purposes, all of the Assets (other than the Rights-of-Way,
Easements and the buildings, structures or improvements upon the same) are
properly classified as tangible personal property and not as real property,
and shall report consistently therewith.

shall:

 



 

(a) not sell, transfer, assign, convey, abandon or otherwise dispose of any of
the Assets, except for sales in the ordinary course of business;

 



 

(b) not make any commitment or enter into any agreement with respect to any

an Assumed Liability;

lapse (prior to its applicable expiration date) in any material respect any

in the ordinary course of business;

 



 

(d) not create or permit the creation of any Lien on any Asset (other than

  ***Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

periods after the Closing, or (ii) postponing to periods after the Closing
payment of costs in respect of the Assets that would otherwise be expected
(based on past practice) to be made in periods before the Closing, in each
case in a manner outside the ordinary course of business, inconsistent with
past practice and contrary to generally accepted industry practices; or

 



 

(k) not agree, resolve, authorize or commit, whether in writing or otherwise,
to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 7.2. _Access to Records and Assets; Access Indemnity and
Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) During the period from the date hereof through the Closing, Seller shall
at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice (i) make all the books and
records relating to the Assets (including the Records) available to Buyer and
its authorized representatives for examination as Buyer may request, and (ii)
permit Buyer and its authorized representatives to consult with employees,
officers, accountants, consultants, legal counsel and other authorized
representatives of Seller that Seller designates and to conduct, at Buyers
sole cost, expense and risk, inspections and site visits of the Assets;
_provided_ , _however_ , that none of Buyer and its authorized representatives

another business of Seller or its Affiliates, including the Excluded Assets,
and is not used in connection with the ownership, use, operation or
maintenance of the Assets, (B) confidential information subject to a third
party confidentiality agreement, or (C) any such information which, if

being withheld and, at the request and expense of Buyer, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek any consents that may be required for
the disclosure of such information to Buyer, and otherwise implement
reasonable arrangements permitting such disclosure (which may include entering
into joint defense or other agreements with Buyer to preserve any attorney-
client or other legal privilege of Seller). Buyer and its authorized
representatives shall comply in all material respects with all rules,
regulations, policies and instructions issued by Seller or any third Person
operator regarding any of Buyers or its authorized representatives actions
prior to Closing while upon, entering or leaving any property included in the
Assets.

 



 

(b) BUYER SHALL PROTECT, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SELLER HARMLESS FROM AND
AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES OCCURRING ON OR TO THE ASSETS OR TO THE PERSON OR
PROPERTY OF ANY PERSON ARISING FROM OR CAUSED BY THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF
SELLER, ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER

 



      
 

 



 

PERSON ACTING ON SELLERS OR ITS AFFILIATES BEHALF IN CONNECTION WITH THE
ACCESS RIGHTS UNDER _SECTION 7.2(a)_, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY
THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, EXCEPTING ONLY THOSE LOSSES ACTUALLY
RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF
SELLER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ ,

authorized representatives to) hold in confidence all information and data
furnished to it (or its Affiliates or representatives) pursuant to this
_Section 7.2_ in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.3. _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, keep confidential and not disclose all
information relating to the Assets (other than relating to the Excluded
Assets) (the " _Restricted Information_ "), and shall not directly or
indirectly use such Restricted Information for any purpose, except as and to
the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement. The obligation shall
continue indefinitely from the Closing and shall not apply to any information
that (a) is in the public domain, (b) is published or otherwise becomes part
of the public domain through no fault of any Seller or any of its Affiliates
or (c) becomes available to any Seller or any of its Affiliates on a non-
confidential basis from a source that did not acquire such information
(directly or indirectly) from Seller or Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates on a confidential basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may
make disclosures required by Law and in connection with disputes hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller, to the extent practicable, shall provide
Buyer with prompt notice thereof so that Buyer may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 7.3_. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained or Buyer waives compliance with the provisions of this _Section
7.3_, Seller shall or shall cause the Person required to disclose such
Restricted Information to furnish only that portion of the information that
such Person is legally required, and, to the extent practicable, Seller shall
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that
confidential treatment is accorded the Restricted Information so furnished.

 



 

Section 7.4. _Regulatory Filings and Consents_. From the date hereof until the
Closing:

 



 

(a) Subject to Sellers and Buyers additional obligations in clauses (b) and
(c) of this _Section 7.4_, Seller and Buyer shall (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things that, in either
case, are necessary, proper or advisable under Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
obtain from the relevant Governmental Authorities all Authorizations, if any,
required to be

 



      
 

 



 

obtained at or prior to the Closing by Buyer or Seller in connection with the
authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Seller nor Buyer nor their respective Affiliates shall be
required to make any material monetary expenditure, commence or be a plaintiff
in any litigation or offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any Person.

 



 

(b) The Parties shall each give prompt notice to the other of the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from (i) any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) any Governmental
Authority or other Person regarding the initiation or threat of initiation of
any claims, actions, suits, proceedings, arbitrations or investigations
against, relating to, or involving or otherwise affecting Buyer or Seller that
relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv)
any Person regarding the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would be reasonably likely to (A) cause
any condition to the obligations of the other Party to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby not to be satisfied, (B) cause a breach of
the representations, warranties or covenants of such Party under this
Agreement, or (C) delay or impede the ability of either Buyer or Seller,
respectively, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
to fulfill their respective obligations set forth herein. No delivery of any
notice pursuant to clause (iv) of this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall cure any breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Party hereto giving such
notice contained in this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Each Party agrees to use best efforts to vigorously contest and to resist
any action, including legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) of any court or other Governmental Authority that is
in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the vigorous pursuit of
all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all available
legislative action, and each Party agrees to provide reasonable cooperation to
the other Party in connection with the foregoing.

 



 

Section 7.5. _Cooperation; Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) In the event that at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Parties hereto
shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further documents and instruments) as any Party hereto may reasonably request,
all at the sole expense of the requesting Party (unless the action requested
should have been taken prior to the Closing, in which case the Party or
Parties that would have borne the expense of taking such action had it been
taken prior to the Closing shall bear such expense). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the

 



      
 

 



 

Parties hereto will take all reasonably requested actions to ensure that (i)
the Assets are, except as otherwise contemplated hereby, transferred to Buyer,
and (ii) that all other assets otherwise used by Seller, are owned by Seller.

 



 

(b) For the longer period of (i) seven (7) years after the Closing Date, (ii)
as required by the terms of the applicable Contract or (iii) as required by
Law, Buyer agrees to retain the originals of the Records at its sole cost and
expense and provide Seller with access thereto upon reasonable request of
Seller in connection with this Agreement or compliance with applicable law.
Seller may retain a copy of the Records to the extent such Records pertain to
its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.6. _Public Announcement_. Neither Party, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, shall make any press release or other public announcement
regarding the existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof (including the
Purchase Price) or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
restrict disclosures to the extent (a) necessary for a Party to perform this
Agreement (including disclosure to a Governmental Authority or any third
Persons holding rights of consent or other rights that may be applicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as reasonably necessary to
seek such consents or provide notices, seek waivers, amendments or termination
of such other rights), (b) required (upon advice of counsel) by applicable
securities or other applicable Laws or regulations or the applicable rules of
any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the Parties or their respective
Affiliates or (c) subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, such Party has
given the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review such disclosure prior
to its release and no objection is raised; and _provided_ , _further_ , that,
in the case of clauses (a) and (b), to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the
other Party regarding the contents of any such release or announcement prior
to making such release or announcement.

 



 

Section 7.7. _Prior Knowledge_. No breach by a Party of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Agreement for any purpose hereunder, and neither the
non-breaching Party nor any Affiliate of the non-breaching Party shall have
any claim or recourse against the breaching Party or its directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents, advisors or
representatives with respect to such breach, under _Article X_ or otherwise,
if the non-breaching Party or any Affiliate of the non-breaching Party had
knowledge prior to the execution of this Agreement of such breach or of the
threat of such breach or the circumstances giving rise to such breach.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.8. _Insurance_. The Parties hereto acknowledge that Seller maintains
a program of property and liability insurance coverage in respect of the
Assets. All of the insurance policies through which the program of coverage is
presently or has previously been provided by or to Seller or its Affiliates
are herein referred to collectively as the " _Seller Policies_." It is
understood and agreed by Buyer that from and after the Closing (i) no
insurance coverage shall be provided under Seller Policies to Buyer and (ii)
subject to _Section 7.9_, no claims regarding any matter whatsoever, whether
or not arising from events occurring prior to the Closing, shall be made by
Buyer against or with respect to any of the Seller Policies, regardless of
their date of issuance unless directed by Seller and for Sellers benefit.

 



 

Section 7.9. _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_.

 



 

(a) If, prior to or after the date of this Agreement but in all cases prior to
the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is or has been damaged or
destroyed by fire or other casualty (a " _Casualty_ ") or is or has been taken
in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (a " _Condemnation
Proceeding_ ") and the amount of accrued but unpaid liability resulting from
such Casualty or Condemnation Proceeding (which shall include the estimated
amount of reduction in the fair market value of such Assets or, in the event
of a Casualty, the estimated cost of repairing the Assets damaged or destroyed
by such Casualty or replacing such Assets with assets of similar utility) (the
" _Restoration Costs_ ") is less than [***]% of the Purchase Price, in the
aggregate, then Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller, at
the Closing, shall pay to Buyer (or its designee) all sums paid to Seller by
third Persons by reason of such Casualty or Condemnation Proceeding with
respect to the affected Assets and shall assign, transfer and set over to
Buyer or Buyers designee all of Sellers and its Affiliates right, title and
interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards and other rights against
third parties arising out of such Casualty or Condemnation Proceeding with
respect to the affected Assets; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall
reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all rights, title,
interests and claims against third Persons for the recovery of Sellers and
its Affiliates unpaid awards and other rights and costs and expenses incurred
prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims or
other rights against third parties or in defending or asserting rights in
connection with such Casualty or Condemnation Proceeding.

 



 

(b) If, prior to or after the date of this Agreement but in all cases prior to
the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by a Casualty or is
taken by a Condemnation Proceeding and the Restoration Costs resulting from
such Casualty or Condemnation Proceeding is equal to or in excess of [***]% of
the Purchase Price, in the aggregate, then Buyer shall nevertheless be
required to close and Seller shall have the right to elect to (i) reduce the
Purchase Price by the Restoration Costs relating to such Casualty or
Condemnation Proceeding or (ii) have Seller repair and restore the affected
Asset at Sellers sole cost and expense (which repair and restoration may
extend post-Closing) and (in either case) Seller shall be entitled to all sums
paid to Seller by third Persons by reason of such Casualty or Condemnation
Proceeding with respect to the

  ***Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

affected Transferred Assets and all rights, title, interests and claims
against third Persons arising out of or relating to such Casualty or
Condemnation Proceeding.

 



 

(c) If, prior to or after the date of this Agreement but in all cases prior to
the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is or has been destroyed by a
Casualty or is or has been taken by a Condemnation Proceeding and the
Restoration Costs resulting from such Casualty or Condemnation Proceeding is
equal to or in excess of [***]% of the Purchase Price, in the aggregate, then
Buyer may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Seller.

 



 

Section 7.10. _Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees_. The
Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees,
if any, posted by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller with any Governmental
Authority or third Person and relating to the Assets are to be transferred to
Buyer. On or before the Closing, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained
in the name of Buyer, replacements for the bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees identified in _Section 7.10_ of the Disclosure Schedule, and shall
cause, effective as of the Closing, the cancellation or return to Seller of
such bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted (or supported) by Seller
and such Affiliates, and Seller shall provide reasonable cooperation to Buyer
in connection therewith. Buyer may also provide evidence that such
replacements are not necessary as a result of existing bonds, letters of
credit or guarantees that Buyer has previously posted as long as such existing
bonds, letters of credit or guarantees are adequate to secure the release of
those posted (or supported) by Seller. _Section 7.10_ of the Disclosure
Schedule identifies the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted (or
supported) by Seller or any other Affiliate of Seller with respect to the
Assets as of the date noted on such Disclosure Schedule, which Seller may
update through the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 7.11. _Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

(a) Any information furnished in the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
modify all of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in
_Article II_. The inclusion of any information on the Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself,
that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is
material to the Assets or Seller, has or would have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect, or is outside the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(b) Seller may from time to time prior to the Closing, by written notice to
Buyer, supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule to correct any matter that
would constitute a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller in
_Article II_ ; _provided_ that for all purposes of this Agreement, including
purposes of determining whether Buyers conditions set forth in _Section
8.3(a)_ have been fulfilled, the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
include only that information contained therein on the date of this Agreement
and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any supplement or
amendment thereto.

  ***Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.12. _Antero Leases_. Prior to Closing, Seller shall obtain
amendments, assignments and conveyances of the leases of real property between
Seller and Antero for the Middle Point Compressor Station and the Zinnia
Compressor Station that provide Buyer with Sellers real property interests in
the Middle Point Compressor Station and the Zinnia Compressor Station, and
such amendments, assignments and conveyances shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyers lenders. If, prior to Closing, Buyer notifies Seller
that Buyer does not believe that the condition in Section 8.3(c)(ii) will be
satisfied by the Termination Date, then Seller and Buyer shall collectively
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain amendments, assignments and
conveyances that will enable such condition to be satisfied.

 



 

Section 7.13. _Construction Projects_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Closing, but in any event on or before July 31, 2013, Seller shall

(c) by Buyer upon notice to Seller, if any of the conditions in _Section 8.1_
or _Section 8.3_ shall not have been fulfilled by the time required or shall

(d) by either Seller or Buyer upon notice to the other Party, if the Closing

pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ shall not be available to any Party whose
breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the
Closing to be consummated by such time.

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 9.1_ if the Closing has failed to occur because
such Party negligently or willfully failed to perform or observe in any

2.2_, _Section 4.1_ and _Section 4.2_ (the " _Fundamental Representations_

or causes of action may be brought against Seller or Buyer based upon,
directly or indirectly, any of the representations, warranties, or agreements

Section 10.2. _Seller s Agreement to Indemnify_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, from and after the
Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents and
representatives and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the
" _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against all liability, demands, claims,
actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Buyer
Damages_ ") asserted against or incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee as a result
of or arising out of:

 



 

(i) a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in _Article
II_ or any Pre-Closing Covenant of Seller (provided that for the purposes of
determining Buyer Damages and determining whether or not any such breach has
occurred, any qualification or exception contained in any representation or
warranty of Seller in _Article II_ relating to materiality (including Seller
Material Adverse Effect) shall be disregarded, other than the reference to
"Material Contracts" in _Section 2.10_ and the referent to "Seller Material
Adverse Effect" in _Section 2.6(a)_ );

  ***Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) a breach of any covenant (other than a Pre-Closing Covenant) of Seller
contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) the Excluded Assets and Retained Liabilities; or

 



 

(iv) any and all Seller Taxes.

 



 

(b) Sellers obligation to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)_ is subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(i) No indemnification shall be made by Seller pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_
(other than with respect to the representation and warranty set forth in
_Section 2.20_): (1) with respect to any individual item (or group of related
items) of Buyer Damage unless such Buyer Damage exceeds [***] and (2) unless
the aggregate amount of all Buyer Damages of the Buyer Indemnitees with
respect to _Section 10.2(a)_ shall exceed the Deductible (after which point
Seller will be obligated only to indemnify Buyer from and against Buyer Damage
in excess of the Deductible but less than or equal to the Cap). The maximum
amount that Seller shall be required to pay in the aggregate pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)_ in respect of all Buyer Damages by all Buyer Indemnitees is
an amount equal to the Cap less the Deductible, after which point Seller will
not have an obligation to indemnify Buyer from and against further such Buyer
Damage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Sellers obligation to indemnify
Buyer under (1) _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ for a breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations, any representation or warranty set forth in _Section 2.11_ or
any Pre-Closing Covenant, (2) _Section 10.2(a)(ii)_, (3) _Section
10.2(a)(iii)_ or (4) _Section 10.2(a)(iv)_ shall not be subject to any of the
limitations in this _Section 10.2(b)(i)_ but shall not, in the aggregate
(together with any and all amounts paid pursuant to _Section 10.4(a)_),
exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price and (y) no indemnification shall
be made by Seller pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ for a breach of the
representation and warranty set forth in _Section 2.20_ with respect to any
individual item (or group of related items) of Buyer Damage unless such Buyer
Damage exceeds [***], and any amounts paid in respect of such indemnification
shall count against the maximum amount that Seller shall be required to pay in
the aggregate pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ as provided in the second
sentence of this _Section 10.2(b)(i)_.

 



 

(ii) The amount of any Buyer Damages shall be reduced by (A) any amount
directly or indirectly received by a Buyer Indemnitee with respect thereto
under any insurance coverage or from any other party alleged to be responsible
therefor and (B) the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized by Buyer
Indemnitee relating thereto. Buyer

  ***Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts
available under such insurance coverage and from such other party alleged to
have responsibility. If a Buyer Indemnitee directly or indirectly receives an
amount under insurance coverage or from such other party with respect to Buyer
Damages at any time subsequent to any indemnification provided by Seller
pursuant to this _Section 10.2_, then such Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly
reimburse Seller for any payment made or expense incurred by Seller in
connection with providing such indemnification up to such amount received by
Buyer Indemnitee. Each Buyer Indemnitee shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate damages in respect of any claim for which such Buyer Indemnitee is
seeking indemnification and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid
any costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and
expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof; and

 



 

(iii) Seller shall be obligated to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees only for those
claims giving rise to Buyer Damages as to which Buyer Indemnitees have given
Seller written notice thereof, and with respect to any claim pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_, such notice must be given prior to the end of the
applicable survival period set forth in _Section 10.1_ with respect to such
claim. Any written notice delivered by a Buyer Indemnitee to Seller with
respect to Buyer Damages shall set forth with as much specificity as is
reasonably practicable the basis of the claim for Buyer Damages and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof.

 



 

 **THIS INDEMNIFICATION IS EXPRESSLY INTENDED TO APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT OR
STRICT LIABILITY ON THE PART OF BUYER INDEMNITEES (BUT NOT ANY SUCH BUYER
INDEMNITEES WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE).**

 



 

Section 10.3. _Buyer s Agreement to Indemnify_. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and Affiliates and its and their respective
directors, officers, employees, members, managers, partners, controlling
Persons, agents and representatives and their respective successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against all
liability, demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, losses,
damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) (collectively, " _Seller Damages_ ") asserted against or incurred by
any of Seller Indemnitees as a result of or arising out of:

 



 

(i) a breach of any representation or warranty contained in _Article IV_ or
any Pre-Closing Covenant of Buyer (provided that for the purposes of
determining Seller Damages and determining whether or not any such breach has
occurred, any qualification or exception contained in any representation or
warranty of Buyer in _Article IV_ relating to

 



      
 

 



 

materiality (including Buyer Material Adverse Effect) shall be disregarded,
other than the reference to "Seller Material Adverse Effect" in _Section
4.7_);

 



 

(ii) a breach of any covenant (other than a Pre-Closing Covenant) of Buyer
contained in this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(b) Buyers obligation to indemnify Seller Indemnitees pursuant to _Section
10.3(a)_ is subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(i) No indemnification shall be made by Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_:
(A) with respect to any individual item (or group of related items) of Seller
Damage unless such Seller Damage exceeds [***] and (B) unless the aggregate
amount of all Seller Damages of the Seller Indemnitees with respect to
_Section 10.3(a)_ shall exceed the Deductible (after which point Buyer will
be obligated only to indemnify Seller from and against Seller Damage in excess
of the Deductible but less than or equal to the Cap). The maximum amount that
Buyer shall be required to pay in the aggregate pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_
in respect of all Seller Damages by all Seller Indemnitees is the Cap less the
Deductible, after which point Buyer will not have an obligation to indemnify
Seller from and against further such Seller Damage. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyers obligation to indemnify Seller under (1) _Section
10.3(a)(i)_ for a breach of any of the Fundamental Representations, _Section
4.8_ or any Pre-Closing Covenant, (2) _Section 10.3(a)(ii)_ or (3) _Section
10.3(a)(iii)_ shall not be subject to any of the limitations in this _Section
10.3(b)(i)_ but shall not, in the aggregate (together with any and all amounts
paid pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)_ ), exceed an amount equal to the Purchase
Price.

 



 

(ii) The amount of any Seller Damages shall be reduced by (A) any amount
directly or indirectly received by a Seller Indemnitee with respect thereto
under any insurance coverage or from any other party alleged to be responsible
therefor and (B) the amount of any Tax benefit directly or indirectly
available to Seller Indemnitee relating thereto. Seller Indemnitees shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such
insurance coverage and from such other party alleged to have responsibility.
If a Seller Indemnitee directly or indirectly receives an amount under
insurance coverage or from such other party with respect to Seller Damages at
any time subsequent to any indemnification provided by Buyer pursuant to this
_Section 10.3_, then such Seller Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse Buyer
for any payment made or expense incurred by Buyer in connection with providing
such

  ***Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification up to such amount received by Seller Indemnitee. Each Seller
Indemnitee shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages in respect of
any claim for which such Seller Indemnitee is seeking indemnification and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or expenses
associated with such claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot be avoided,
to minimize the amount thereof; and

 



 

(iii) Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify Seller Indemnitees only for those
claims giving rise to Seller Damages as to which Seller Indemnitees have given
Buyer written notice thereof, and with respect to any claim pursuant to
_Section 10.3(b)(i)_, such notice must be given prior to the end of the
applicable survival period set forth in _Section 10.1_ with respect to such
claim. Any written notice delivered by a Seller Indemnitee to Buyer with
respect to Seller Damages shall set forth with as much specificity as is
reasonably practicable the basis of the claim for Seller Damages and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof.

 



 

 **THIS INDEMNIFICATION IS EXPRESSLY INTENDED TO APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT OR
STRICT LIABILITY ON THE PART OF SELLER INDEMNITEES (BUT NOT ANY SUCH SELLER
INDEMNITEES WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE).**

 



 

Section 10.4. _Third Party Indemnification_. The obligations of Seller to
indemnify Buyer Indemnitees under _Section 10.2_ with respect to Buyer Damages
and the obligations of Buyer to indemnify Seller Indemnitees under _Section
10.3_ with respect to Seller Damages, in either case resulting from the
assertion of liability by third parties (each, as the case may be, a " _Claim_
"), will be subject to the following additional terms and conditions:

 



 

(a) Any Party against whom any Claim is asserted (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
will give the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice
of any such Claim promptly after learning of such Claim, and the Indemnifying
Party may at its option undertake the defense thereof by representatives of
its own choosing. Failure to give prompt notice of a Claim hereunder shall not
affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Article X_, except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure to give prompt
notice. If the Indemnifying Party, within thirty (30) days after notice of any
such Claim, or such shorter period as is reasonably required, fails to assume
the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party will (upon further notice to
the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk, and at the
expense, of the Indemnifying Party, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Party to assume the defense of such Claim at any time prior to settlement,
compromise or final determination thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Anything in this _Section 10.4_ to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any
action, suit or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment (i) which
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant
or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a written release from all liability
in respect of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) for other than monetary
damages to be borne by the Indemnifying Party, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully in
all aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial,
compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which indemnity
is sought pursuant to this _Article X_, including by providing the other
Party with reasonable access to employees and officers (including as
witnesses) and other information.

 



 

Section 10.5. _No Duplication_. Any liability for indemnification hereunder
shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of
facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein.

 



 

Section 10.6. _Amount of Losses_. The determination of the dollar amount of
any Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as the case may be, shall be based solely
on the actual dollar value thereof, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and shall
not take into account any multiplier valuations, including any multiple based
on earnings or other financial indicia.

 



 

Section 10.7. _Remedies Exclusive_. Indemnification under this _Article X_
will be the exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for any breach of a
representation or warranty in this Agreement and, in furtherance of the
foregoing, each of the Parties, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby
waives and releases the other Parties hereto (and such other Parties
Affiliates) from, to the fullest extent permitted under any applicable Law,
any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or its Affiliates may have
against the other Parties hereto except as provided herein.

 



 

Section 10.8. _No Special Damages_. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE
UNDER THIS _ARTICLE X_ OR OTHERWISE IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR
EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , IF ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNITEES OR BUYER
INDEMNITEES IS HELD LIABLE TO A THIRD PERSON FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES AND THE
INDEMNITOR IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH SELLER INDEMNITEE OR BUYER
INDEMNITEE FOR THE MATTER THAT GAVE RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES, THE INDEMNITOR SHALL
BE LIABLE, AND OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE SUCH INDEMNITEES, FOR SUCH DAMAGES.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.9. _Conspicuous Legends; Nature of Indemnification_. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT THE BOLD OR CAPITALIZED LETTERS IN THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTE
CONSPICUOUS LEGENDS. IT IS EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE INDEMNIFICATION
PROVIDED IN THIS _ARTICLE X_ COULD INVOLVE INDEMNIFICATION FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER THEORIES OF STRICT LIABILITY.

First Party or its contractors or subcontractors under this Agreement. The
other Party, upon receipt of notice of the filing of any such liens, may at
its option require the First Party to furnish a bond in an amount and with
such sureties as may be approved by the other Party, conditioned to indemnify
and save harmless the other Party from all such liens. In the event the First
Party fails or refuses to furnish such bond when so required, the other Party
shall have the right to pay any such sums necessary to obtain the release of
such liens and to bill the costs to the First Party, with interest at the
lesser of the prime rate published in the _Wall Street Journal_ "Money Rates"
column or the maximum rate permitted by law.

 



 

A. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Gatherer shall not permit
or grant any liens, claims, security interests or encumbrances of any kind or
nature on MarkWests property on which the Applicable Gatherers Connection
Facilities are located.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 

 ** _TERM AND ABANDONMENT_**

 



 

4.1 _Term_. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, this
Agreement will be effective as of the date first written above and will
continue in force and effect unless and until terminated by MarkWest upon (30)
days prior written notice following (i) the termination or expiration of all
processing agreements between MarkWest and one or more third parties for the
processing of Gas that is gathered through the Interconnection Points or (ii)
the disconnection of MarkWests Connection Facilities from Gatherers
Connection Facilities pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above,
the indemnification provisions and payment obligations set forth in this

at the time.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 

 ** _MEASUREMENT AND TESTIN_** **G**

 



 

5.1 _Responsibility for Measurement and Custody Transfer_. MarkWest shall be
responsible for the measurement and custody transfer of the Gas at the
Interconnection.

 



 

5.2 _Measurement and Testing Standards_. Gas shall be measured by MarkWest at
the Interconnection Points. All measurement procedures shall conform to
applicable GPA standards for measurement. The measurement and the composition
of the gas shall be made in accordance with the following:

 



 

A. MarkWest shall install, operate and maintain, or cause to be installed,
operated and maintained, suitable meter or meters and/or other necessary
equipment for the purpose of measuring, with such measurement to conform to
the AGA-3 standard (or AGA Standard as applicable for the type of measurement
utilized), as revised from time to time, the volume, heating value and
composition of Gas at the Interconnection Points. Each measurement by MarkWest
shall be made in accordance with the applicable American Gas Association Gas
Measurement Committee standards or any revision thereof. The measured volume
and Btu content, as measured by MarkWest, shall be calculated at Standard Base
Conditions.

 



 

B. The accuracy of MarkWests measuring equipment shall be verified by tests
using means and methods generally acceptable in the gas industry, at least
quarterly. Measuring equipment found to be registering inaccurately shall be
adjusted to read as accurately as possible. MarkWest shall give Gatherer five
(5) Business Days notice of upcoming tests. If Gatherer fails to have a
representative present, the results of the test shall nevertheless be
considered valid until the next test. MarkWest shall, upon written request of
Gatherer, conduct a test of MarkWests measuring equipment, provided that in
no event shall MarkWest be required to test its equipment more frequently than
once a month. All tests of such measuring equipment shall be made at
MarkWests expense, except that Gatherer

 



      
 

 



 

shall bear the expense of tests made at its request if the inaccuracy is found
to be less than two percent (2%).

 



 

C. If, for any reason, any measuring equipment is inoperative or inaccurate by
more than one percent (1.0%) in the measurement of Gas, then the volume of Gas
delivered during the period of such inaccuracy shall be determined on the
basis of the best data available using the first of the following methods
which is feasible:

 



 

1. By using the registration of any check measuring equipment installed and accurately registering; or

 



 

2. By using a percentage factor to correct the error if the percentage of error is ascertainable by calibration, test, or mathematical calculations; or

 



 

3. By comparing deliveries made during preceding periods under similar delivery conditions when the meter was registering accurately.

 



 

D. An adjustment based on such determination shall be made for such period of
inaccuracy as may be definitely known, or if not known, then for one half the
period since the date of the last meter test, but in no event shall any
adjustment result in a reallocation of shrinkage or Plant Products to extend
back beyond six (6) months from the date the error was first made known by one
Party hereunder to the other.

 



 

E. Each Party shall have the right to inspect the other Partys equipment,
charts, and other measurement or test data during business hours; but the
reading, calibration, and adjustment of such equipment and changing of charts
shall be done by the Party installing and furnishing same. Unless the Parties
otherwise agree, each Party shall preserve all its original test data, charts,
and other similar records for a period of at least two (2) years.

 



 

F. MarkWest shall use gas chromatographs of samples of the Gas at the Receipt
Point, which samples shall be analyzed by MarkWest in accordance with
applicable industry standards. All analyses shall determine the composition of
the Gas by component in mole percent, Plant Product(s) content in GPM, Thermal
Content, and specific gravity, all by means of chromatographic methods.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE VI_**

 

 ** _QUALITY_**

 



 

6.1 _Quality_. As measured at the Interconnection Points, Gas delivered by
Gatherer shall be of a quality that, after processing in the Sherwood Plant as
it then currently exists, meets the quality specifications of pipelines
receiving Gas at the redelivery point(s) downstream of the Sherwood Plant, as
in effect from time to time, and as such specifications may have been waived
or grandfathered by such pipelines; provided that the water content of Gas
delivered by Gatherer to the Interconnection Points shall not exceed
pounds per MMcf. Gas delivered by Gatherer to the Interconnection Points with
a water content less than or equal to pounds per MMcf shall be
considered to be dry for purposes of measurement and the calculation of Gross
Heating Value. Additionally, at each Interconnection Points, Gas delivered by
Gatherer shall:

 



      
 

 



 

A. be commercially free from dust, sand, gum, gum forming constituents,
diluent, and other liquids and solids;

 



 

B. have a Gross Heating Value of not less than Btu per Cubic Foot,
unless mutually agreed upon;

 



 

C. not contain more than 1 grain of hydrogen sulfide per Cubic Feet of
Gas;

 



 

D. not contain more than % by volume carbon dioxide; and

 



 

E. be commercially free of liquid hydrocarbons, free water, and condensed
water and other liquids.

 



 

6.2 If Gas tendered by Gatherer should fail to meet any one or more of the
above specifications from time to time, then:

 



 

A. MarkWest may take receipt of the non-conforming Gas, and that receipt shall
not be construed as a waiver or change of standards for future Gas volumes; or

 



 

B. MarkWest may, at its sole discretion and without liability to Gatherer,
cease receiving the non-conforming Gas from Gatherer, and shall notify
Gatherer that it will cease receiving the non-conforming Gas.

 



 

If the Gas as delivered contains contaminants not in conformance with the
specifications in Article 6, then as between the Parties, Gatherer shall be
responsible for, and shall reimburse MarkWest for all direct damages and any
reasonable incurred costs and expenses resulting therefrom.

 



 

6.3 Notwithstanding Section 6.2, if Gas from Gatherer conforms to all
specifications required by this Article 6 other than hydrocarbon dew point
and/or Gross Heating Value, MarkWest shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to accept such Gas and to blend and commingle such Gas with other Gas in the
Pipeline so that it meets the applicable specifications, provided that
MarkWest shall not be required to accept and to blend or commingle such Gas to
the extent that MarkWest determines, in good faith, that the acceptance,
blending or commingling of such Gas is reasonably likely to (i) adversely
affect (x) the safety, integrity or operation of MarkWests Connection
Facilities, the Sherwood Plant or facilities downstream therefrom, (y) the
delivery of Gas to redelivery points downstream of the Sherwood Plant that may
be applicable from time to time, or (z) the Gas of third parties, or (ii)
otherwise result in economic harm to third parties using the Sherwood Plant or
facilities downstream therefrom.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII**

 

 ** _DELIVERIES, PRESSURE AND QUANTITY_**

 



 

7.1 _Delivery Pressure_. Gatherer shall deliver Gas to MarkWest at the
Interconnection at the prevailing pressures as they exist from time to time.

 



      
 

 



 

7.2 _Quantity_. The maximum daily deliveries of Gas by Gatherer to the
Interconnection Points shall not exceed any contractual maximums applicable to
Sherwood Plant deliveries related to shippers on the Gathering System, unless
mutually agreed by the Parties.

 



 

A. During any period in which (i) all or any portion of the Sherwood Plant or
any facilities downstream therefrom is shut down or has reduced capacity,
whether due to mechanical failure, maintenance or repairs, operating
conditions outside of the design parameters of the Sherwood Plant or such
downstream facilities, Force Majeure, or any constraint or condition involving
any facilities downstream of the Sherwood Plant; or (ii) the Gas available for
receipt at all receipt points (including the Interconnection Points) at the
Sherwood Plant exceeds the capacity thereof; or (iii) MarkWest determines
reasonably and in good faith that the operation of all or any portion of the
Sherwood Plant or any facilities downstream therefrom will cause injury or
harm to persons or property or to the integrity of the Sherwood Plant or such
downstream facilities, the receipt and delivery of Gas at the Interconnection
Points may be curtailed.

 



 

B. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, MarkWest
may, at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion, allocate
available capacity in the Sherwood Plant and facilities downstream therefrom
consistent with MarkWests Gas processing agreements relating to the Sherwood
Plant.

 



 

7.3 _Uniform Deliveries_. Gatherer shall deliver Gas to MarkWest at the
Interconnection Points at a reasonably uniform rate of flow. Each Party will
provide prompt notice to the other Party of any events that would cause
deliveries to or receipts from an Interconnection Points to be curtailed or
interrupted.

 



 

7.4 _Processing Service_. The execution of this Agreement does not authorize
or set forth the terms and conditions of processing services by MarkWest at
the Sherwood Plant. Processing services at the Sherwood Plant will only be
rendered after the execution of appropriate agreements with MarkWest for the
processing of Gas, the exchange of Plant Products for fractionated products
and the marketing thereof. Gatherer will not deliver any Gas to the
Interconnection that is not subject to such agreements with MarkWest for the
Sherwood Plant.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 

 ** _ALLOCATION TO GATHERER S RECEIPT POINTS; IMBALANCES_**

 



 

8.1 _Information Required for Allocations_. At any time and from time to time
during which MarkWest is requested or required, by one or more Processing
Customers, to allocate condensate, Plant Products, bypass Gas, fuel, residue
Gas or other items to one or more receipt points on the Gathering System (such
points, the " **Gathering Receipt Points** "), Gatherer shall provide such
measurement and allocation information to MarkWest as MarkWest may request to
permit MarkWest to make such allocations (such information collectively, the "
**Information** "). The Parties acknowledge that, as of the date of this
Agreement, at least one Processing Customer has requested MarkWest to make
such allocations.

 



 

A. For each calendar month to which this Section 8.1 applies, Gatherer shall
provide the Information to MarkWest for each Processing Customer by the fifth
business day of the following calendar month.

to be installed at each Gathering Receipt Point (each, a " **Gathering
Measurement Point** ").

 



 

C. Gatherers measurement equipment at each Gathering Measurement Point shall
include a reasonably sufficient number of data ports, and Gatherer shall
permit MarkWest to connect to such data ports, as shall be required to provide
to MarkWest on a real-time basis all measurement data generated by such
measurement equipment. MarkWest shall be responsible at its own cost for
obtaining equipment and/or services to connect to such data ports and receive
and process such data.

 



 

D. **MarkWest shall have no responsibility or liability for, and Gatherer
hereby covenants and agrees to indemnify and defend MarkWest and its
Affiliates and each of their directors, members, managers, partners, officers
and employees from and against all damages, claims, losses or the like arising
from or relating to, (i) the timeliness, accuracy or completeness of the
Information, (ii) any failure or delay by MarkWest in preparing the statements
and making the payments required pursuant to any agreement with any third
party (including, without limitation, any Processing Customer) to the extent
the same results from any failure or delay by Gatherer to provide the
Information, (iii) any errors or inaccuracies in payments made under any
agreement with any third party (including, without limitation, any Processing
Customer) resulting from errors in the Information.**

 



 

8.2 _Gathering System Allocations_. Gatherer shall remain responsible for
making all allocations and measurements relating to the Gathering System or
specified herein, and MarkWest has no responsibility therefor.

 



 

8.3 _Point Operator_. The Parties recognize that MarkWest shall be designated
by the downstream pipeline carriers at the Sherwood Plant redelivery point(s)
(the " **Redelivery Point(s)** ") as the point operator and shall be
considered by such pipeline carriers to be responsible for the operation of
MarkWests pipeline interconnections to the pipeline carriers at the
Redelivery Point(s). Upon MarkWest entering into any operational balancing
agreements (" **OBAs** ") with such pipeline carriers, MarkWest shall be
responsible for the administration of all such OBAs and, subject to Section
8.4, for all terms and conditions of any such OBA.

 



 

8.4 _Imbalances_. The Parties recognize that certain residue Gas imbalances
may occur, and each calendar month, the Parties agree to actively communicate
and cooperate with each other, and with any interconnecting pipeline at the
Redelivery Point(s), to review appropriate data to identify any imbalance, and
to eliminate or remedy any imbalance as soon as either Party becomes aware of
an imbalance. The Parties further agree to manage daily receipts and
deliveries so that the imbalances shall be kept as near to zero as
practicable. MarkWest will use commercially reasonable efforts to manage any
imbalances with interconnecting pipeline(s) at the Redelivery Point(s)
physically. To the extent that any such imbalances are balanced by payments
between MarkWest and any such interconnecting pipeline(s) at the Redelivery
Point(s), and to the extent such imbalances are attributable or related to
Gatherer or to Gas delivered by Gatherer to the Sherwood Plant, the Parties
shall work in good faith to settle such

 



      
 

 



 

payments between the Parties and shippers on Gatherers system. MarkWest shall
not be required to deviate from MarkWests standard operating and accounting
procedures to reduce or eliminate any such imbalances.

After the date hereof, Buyer may, without cause and in accordance with the
terms and conditions hereunder, request the discontinuation of a Service
(whether in full or in relation to one or a series but less than all of the
Assets) or all of the Services by giving Seller at least fifteen (15) days
prior written notice (or such shorter period as Seller, in its sole
discretion, may agree). In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable
following receipt of such written notice, but in any event, within fifteen
(15) days, Seller will notify Buyer as to whether termination of such Service
will: (i) require the termination or partial termination of, or otherwise
affect the provision of, any other Services, or (ii) result in any early
termination costs payable to third party providers. If Buyer does not withdraw
its termination notice within three (3) days after receipt of such notice from
Seller, Buyer will reimburse Seller for the reasonable costs resulting from
Buyers early termination of such Service.

 



 

7. _Reimbursement_. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all costs and expenses (including operating costs, capital expenditures, and Taxes) associated with the Assets during the term of this Agreement; provided that Seller shall not be entitled to any reimbursement for any costs and expenses associated with its obligation set forth in Section 7.13 of the Purchase and Sale Agreement to complete certain construction projects.

 



 

8. _Fees_. Buyer shall, in addition to other amounts owed under this Agreement, pay Seller the amount set forth below per month for each month (prorated on a daily basis with respect to each partial month during the applicable Transition Period) for which any particular Service is performed by Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:

 



 

Operations and Support Services

 



 

All other Services, in the aggregate

 



 

9. _Payment Procedures_. Seller shall submit an invoice (the " _Invoice_ ") to Buyer on or before the fifteenth (15th) Business Day of each calendar month setting forth the charges for each Service, if applicable, for the preceding month pursuant to Section 8, including any costs and

 



      
 

 



 

expenses permitted pursuant to this Agreement. Absent manifest error in
calculations contained in an Invoice (if there is a manifest error, Buyer will
correct such error and show such recalculation), Buyer shall pay on or before
the last Business Day of each month in which it receives an Invoice the
amounts invoiced to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
U.S. dollars to the bank account designated on the Invoice by Seller.
Adjustment credits or debits shall be shown on the Invoice next succeeding the
Invoice in which the adjustment is made. Buyer may object to any invoiced
amounts for any Service at any time before, at the time of, or after payment
is made, provided such objection is made in good faith and in writing to
Seller no later than fifteen (15) days after receipt of such Invoice. Payment
of any amount set forth in an Invoice shall not constitute approval thereof.
Seller and Buyer shall meet as expeditiously as possible to resolve any
dispute.

 



 

10. _Late Payments_. Any amount not paid by either Party under this Agreement on or before the due date shall bear interest, compounded monthly, at an annual rate equal to ten percent (10%).

 



 

11. _Default_. It shall constitute a default on behalf of Buyer (a " _Default_ ") if Buyer fails to timely pay any invoiced amount for Services provided pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 9, which failure continues for at least thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice to Buyer that such invoiced amount is past due. Upon the occurrence of a Default, at Sellers option, (a) Seller may suspend all or any portion of the provision of Services hereunder, including Services for which payment is outstanding, until such time as the Default is cured and all amounts owing to Seller under this Agreement for such suspended Services are paid in full or (b) Seller may elect to terminate this Agreement. If Seller elects to suspend Services, Seller shall continue to have the right at any time thereafter to terminate this Agreement. Notwithstanding any suspension or termination by Seller, Seller shall remain entitled to receive payment in full for all amounts due, together with interest pursuant to Section 10.

 



 

12. _Disclaimer of Warranties/Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Seller nor its Affiliates (collectively, " _Seller Group_ ") makes any, and disclaims any, representations and warranties, express or implied, with respect to the performance of the Services, and Seller Group shall have no liability for or in connection with any and all claims arising out of or resulting directly or indirectly from the Services performed by Seller Group or Seller Groups contractors, other than (a) matters caused by or resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller, (b) claims brought against Buyer by employees and contractors of Seller or (c) damages to any equipment of Seller or its contractors; provided, however, that Seller shall not indemnify Buyer in the case of clause (a) or (b) to the extent that such claims are caused by Buyer or arise from or are related to Buyers negligence or willful misconduct. **Notwithstanding any other terms in this Agreement, subject to this Section 12(a), (b) and (c), Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (collectively, " _Buyer Group_ ") and their successors and assigns) hereby releases Seller Group from and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller Group and Seller Groups contractors from and against any and all claims arising out of or resulting from the Services or the performance thereof, including any and all claims relating to (v) injury, illness or death of any Person including Buyer Group, Seller Group or their respective representatives, (w) damages to or loss of any property or resources (including damage to**

 



      
 

 



 

 **property or resources of third parties, Seller Group, Buyer Group or their
respective and/or of Buyer s representatives), (x) breach of contract, (y)
common law causes of action such as active or passive, sole, concurrent or
comparative negligence, strict liability, nuisance or trespass, or (z)
violation of Law or otherwise. Subject to this Section 12(a), (b) and (c),
these indemnity and defense obligations apply regardless of cause or of any
negligent acts or omissions (including active or passive, sole, concurrent or
comparative negligence), strict liability, breach of duty (statutory or
otherwise), violation of Law, or other fault of Seller Group or Seller Groups
contractors, or any pre-existing defect**. In each case, the indemnification
procedures applicable to this Agreement shall be the same indemnification
procedures set forth in Article X of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.

 



 

13. _Force Majeure_.

 



 

(a) If a Party to this Agreement is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by
force majeure (as hereafter defined in (c) below) to carry out its obligations
under this Agreement, other than obligations to make money payments, that
Party shall give the other Party prompt written notice of the force majeure
with reasonably full particulars and the obligations of the Party giving
notice, so far as they are affected by force majeure, shall be suspended
during, but no longer than, the continuance of the force majeure. The affected
Party shall use all reasonable diligence to remove the effects of the force
majeure.

 



 

(b) The requirement that any force majeure shall be remedied with all
reasonable dispatch shall not require the settlement of strikes, lockouts, or
other labor difficulty by the Party involved, contrary to its wishes; the
handling of such difficulties shall be entirely within the discretion of the
Party concerned.

 



 

(c) The term " _force majeure_ " for purposes of this Agreement means an act

specifically enumerated above or otherwise, which is not reasonably within the
control of the Party claiming the right to suspend its obligations under this
Section 13.

 



 

14. _Assignability_. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall assign or sublease any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the non-assigning Party, except to an Affiliate of the assigning Party. This restriction shall not affect Sellers right to engage its Affiliates and contractors and their respective employees to perform the Services.

 



 

15. _Purchase and Sale Agreement_. This Agreement is made in accordance with and is subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and the terms, covenants and conditions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement are incorporated herein by reference, provided that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.

 



      
 

 



 

16. _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction and Waiver of Jury Trial_. **THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF COLORADO, USA WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS EXCEPT THAT, WITH RESPECT TO ALL MATTERS RELATING TO TITLE TO OR THE CONVEYANCE OF THE ASSETS LOCATED IN WEST VIRGINIA, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA SHALL GOVERN. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE COURTS OF COLORADO LOCATED IN DENVER COUNTY, COLORADO OR THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN DENVER COUNTY, COLORADO AND APPROPRIATE APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH COURTS. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT OR ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.**

Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by the Party to whom compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to a change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

 



 

18. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an agreement in writing executed by Buyer and Seller.

 



 

19. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained in this Agreement entitles anyone other than Seller or Buyer or their authorized successors and assigns to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind whatsoever, except with respect to waivers and indemnities that expressly provide for indemnification of Buyer Group or Seller Group, in which case members of such groups are considered third party beneficiaries for the sole purposes of those indemnity provisions.

 



 

20. _Independent Contractor_. In its performance of Services, Seller shall be considered an independent contractor, and it is not the purpose or intention of this Agreement to create (and it shall not be construed as creating) a joint venture, partnership or any type of association, and neither Party is authorized to act as an agent or principal for the other Party with respect to any matter related hereto. It is expressly understood and agreed that this Agreement is a purely

 



      
 

 



 

commercial transaction between the Parties and that nothing stated herein
shall operate to create any fiduciary duty which a Party shall owe to another
Party, except with respect to the handling of cash by either Party on behalf
of the other Party.

 



 

21. _Construction_. Each of Buyer and Seller has had an adequate opportunity to review each and every provision of this Agreement and to submit the same to legal counsel for review and advice. Based on the foregoing, the rule of construction, if any, that a contract be construed against the drafter shall not apply to interpretation or construction of this Agreement.
