normal business hours and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of Seller&#146;s or its Subsidiaries&#146; business, and upon reasonable advance notice, to its employees and all work papers, schedules, memoranda and other

and amounts. If Buyer and Seller resolve their differences over the disputed items and amounts in the Estimated Pension Statement in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the Estimated Pension Statement shall be revised to reflect such resolution
and the amount of the Net Pension Liabilities agreed upon by Seller and Buyer as reflected in such revised Estimated Pension Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent fraud. </P>
