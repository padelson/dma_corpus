SALE OF ASSETS AND SHARES AND ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES

 

 _Section 2.1_ _Asset Purchase_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement (including  _Section 2.6_ and _Section
2.7(c)_), at the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause one or more of its
Subsidiaries (such Subsidiaries, the " _Other Asset Sellers_ ") to, sell,
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer (or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned (which for this purpose, shall include any Subsidiary in which
there exists a _de minimis_ shareholder as required by local law) Subsidiary
of Buyer designated by Buyer (such Subsidiary, an " _Other Buyer_ ")), and
Buyer shall, or shall cause such Other Buyer to, acquire and accept from
Seller or such Other Asset Seller, all of Sellers and such Other Asset
Sellers respective right, title and interest in and to all the Purchased
Assets as they exist at the Closing, free and clear of Liens other than
Permitted Liens and Liens arising under the Assumed Debt.

 

 _Section 2.2_ _Share Purchase_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement (including  _Section 2.7(c)_), at the Closing,
Seller shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries (such
Subsidiaries, the " _Other Share Sellers_ " and, together with the Other Asset
Sellers, the " _Other Sellers_ ") to, sell, assign, transfer, convey and
deliver to Buyer (or an Other Buyer designated by Buyer), and Buyer shall
acquire and accept, or shall cause such Other Buyer to acquire and accept,
from Seller or such Other Share Sellers, all of Sellers and such Other Share
Sellers respective right, title and interest in and to all of the Purchased
Shares, free and clear of Liens.

 

 _Section 2.3_ _Excluded Assets_. All Excluded Assets shall be retained by
Seller and its Affiliates and are not being acquired by Buyer.

_Section 2.4_ _Assumed Liabilities; Excluded Liabilities_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Closing, Buyer shall accept, assume and agree to pay, perform, fulfill
and discharge when due any and all Assumed Liabilities. Following the Closing,
Buyer shall be responsible for all Assumed Liabilities, regardless of when or
where such Assumed Liabilities arose or arise, or whether the facts on which
they are based occurred prior to or subsequent to the Closing Date, regardless
of where or against whom such Assumed Liabilities are asserted or determined
or whether asserted or determined prior to the Agreement Date. Buyer shall not
be released from any Liability hereunder if it assigns any of its rights or
Liabilities hereunder to any of its Affiliates. Buyer shall indemnify Seller
for the performance by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries of any Assumed
Liability, including any Assumed Liability that Seller or its Subsidiaries
performs due to applicable obligees exercise of its lawful rights not to
accept the performance of such

 



29  Assumed Liability by, or on behalf of, Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
subject to, and in accordance with, _Article 9_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) nothing
contained in this Agreement shall require Buyer or its Affiliates to pay,
perform or satisfy any of the Assumed Liabilities so long as Buyer or its
Affiliates shall in good faith contest, or cause to be contested, with the
relevant third party that is the obligee of such Assumed Liability the amount
or validity thereof or shall in good faith assert any defense or offset
thereto, and (ii) the fact that a Liability may fall under the definition of
"Assumed Liabilities" and may have been assumed by Buyer or its Affiliates
hereunder shall not in any respect prevent Buyer or any other Buyer
Indemnified Party from seeking or receiving indemnification hereunder with
respect to such Liability to the extent such Person is entitled to
indemnification with respect to such Liability or obligation pursuant to the
terms of Article 9\.

 

(b) The Parties agree that, except for the Assumed Liabilities, Buyer shall
not accept, assume, pay, perform, fulfill or discharge or otherwise have any
Liability for, any Liabilities of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (whether
now existing or hereafter arising), and Seller and its Affiliates shall
retain, and shall be solely responsible and liable for paying,
performing, fulfilling and discharging when due, all such other Liabilities
of Seller or its Affiliates and the Excluded Liabilities.

 

 _Section 2.5_ _Transfer_.

 

(a) The right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets and the
Purchased Shares shall be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed
and delivered, and the Assumed Liabilities shall be assumed, pursuant to
transfer and assumption agreements and such other instruments in such form as
may be necessary or appropriate to effect a conveyance of the Purchased Shares
and the Purchased Assets and an assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in
accordance with the terms set forth herein in the jurisdictions in which such
transfers are to be made. Such transfer and assumption agreements shall be in
a form mutually agreed by the Parties as between Seller and/or one or more of
its Other Sellers and Buyer and/or one or more of its Other Buyers, as
required in each jurisdiction, and shall include: (i) with respect to the
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, a bill of sale and assignment and
assumption agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(the " _Bill of Sale_ "), (ii) to the extent required by Law or otherwise
agreed by the Parties and in compliance with _Section 2.5(b)_, a local
transfer agreement for each jurisdiction other than the United States in which
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities are located or the Purchased Entities
or Purchased Minority Interests are organized (each such agreement, a "
_Local Transfer Agreement_ ") (provided that if such Purchased Assets,
Purchased Shares or Assumed Liabilities are of a type or nature that are not
transferable under local Law or custom pursuant to a Local Transfer
Agreement, or if a Local Transfer Agreement is not sufficient under local Law
or custom to transfer to Buyer or the applicable Other Buyer such applicable
Purchased Assets, Purchased Shares or Assumed Liabilities, the transfer of
such Purchased Assets, Purchased Shares or Assumed Liabilities shall be
effected or further substantiated, as applicable, pursuant to Other Transfer
Documents), (iii) the sublease agreements with respect to all Business Real
Property set forth on  _Schedule A-(v)(c)_ of the Disclosure Letter in
accordance with _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter (collectively, the
" _Subleases_ ") that shall be entered into and executed no later than at or
as of the Closing by Seller and/or one or more of its Other Sellers, as
appropriate, and Buyer or one or more of its Other Buyers, or to the extent
entered into and executed prior to the Closing, by a Purchased Entity, (iv)
with respect to the Purchased Shares, the Equity Transfer Documents, (v) with
respect to applicable Patents, a patent assignment agreement substantially in
the form attached as an exhibit to the IPMA (the " _Patent Assignment_ "),
(vi) with respect to applicable Trademarks, a trademark assignment agreement
substantially in the form attached as an exhibit to the IPMA (the " _Trademark
Assignment_ "), (vii) with respect to applicable Copyright and Mask Works, a
copyright and mask works assignment agreement substantially in the form
attached as an exhibit to the IPMA (the " _Copyright and Mask Work Assignment
Agreement_ "), (viii) with respect to applicable Trade Secrets, a trade
secret assignment agreement

 



30  substantially in the form attached as an exhibit to the IPMA (the " _Trade
Secret Assignment Agreement_ ") and (ix) such other deeds, bills of sale,
asset transfer agreements, demerger deeds or plans, Intellectual Property
Rights transfer agreements, endorsements, assignments, assumptions, leases,
subleases, affidavits and other instruments of sale, conveyance, lease,
transfer and assignment as may be required by local Law or custom, or
reasonably requested by Buyer, to effect the transfer of the Purchased Assets
or Purchased Shares in accordance with this Agreement, in each case, in such
form as is reasonably satisfactory to the Parties (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, which shall not contain provisions expanding the scope of the Parties
respective obligations as set forth in this Agreement) (the " _Other Transfer
Documents_ "). To the extent resolutions of Sellers or any of its
Subsidiaries board of directors (or local equivalent) and stockholders (or
local equivalent) authorizing and approving the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Transaction Documents are required by Law to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, at
Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer a certificate from Seller and each such
Subsidiary dated as of the Closing Date and attaching with respect to each
such Person such resolutions.

(b) Each Local Transfer Agreement shall be in form and substance in the form
mutually agreed which shall maintain the same legal meaning and effect under
local Law as provided in this Agreement (or as otherwise mutually acceptable
to Buyer and Seller (and the relevant Other Sellers and Other Buyers, as
required under applicable local Law) in all respects); _provided_ that in
each case that (i) to the extent permissible under local Law, the Local
Transfer Agreements shall serve purely to effect the legal transfer of the
applicable Purchased Assets or Purchased Shares and shall not have any effect
on the value being received by Seller or given by Buyer in the Purchase
Transaction, or the terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated
hereby, all of which shall be determined by this Agreement, except where
required by local Law (and any consideration paid by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Equity
Transfer Documents or Local Transfer Agreement shall be deemed for all
purposes to comprise part of, and not be in addition to, the amounts payable
hereunder), (ii) no such Local Transfer Agreement shall in any way modify,
amend, or constitute a waiver of, any provision of this Agreement (except to
the extent required by Law of the applicable jurisdiction) and (iii) no such
Local Transfer Agreement shall include any additional representations or
warranties, covenants or agreements except to the extent required by Law of
the applicable jurisdiction. In the event of any inconsistency between
this Agreement and a Local Transfer Agreement, this Agreement will control to
the extent permissible under Law of an applicable jurisdiction. Such Transfer
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document will be effective
as of Closing or at such other times as specifically provided in each
respective Transaction Document and will be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable Transaction Document.

 

 _Section 2.6_ _Approvals and Consents_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Closing Transfer
Document to the contrary, neither this Agreement nor any other Closing
Transfer Document shall constitute an agreement to sell, convey, transfer,
assign or deliver (a " _Transfer_ ") to Buyer or any Other Buyer (or, in
connection with Operational Separation, to any Purchased Entity)
any Purchased Asset or any claim, right or benefit arising under or resulting
from such Purchased Asset if and for so long as the Transfer or attempted
Transfer to Buyer or any Other Buyer (or, in connection with Operational
Separation, to any Purchased Entity), without the Consent of a third party,
under applicable Law or the express terms of the applicable Contract, would
constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of such third party,
would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement concerning
such Purchased Asset, or, unless waived by Buyer, would in any material way
adversely affect the rights, upon Transfer, of Buyer or its Affiliates with
respect to such Purchased Asset (such assets being referred to herein as "
_Restricted Assets_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, unless and until any such Consent with respect to any Restricted
Asset is obtained, such Restricted Asset shall not 

 



31  constitute a Purchased Asset; _provided_ that at no time on or after the
Closing shall any Restricted Assets for which Consent has not been obtained
constitute Excluded Assets nor shall any Liability arising out of, or related
to, such Restricted Assets constitute an Excluded Liability solely by virtue
of being Restricted Assets, in each case for purposes of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any Liability (other than an Excluded
Liability) arising from such Restricted Assets on or after the Closing,
including any Taxes to the extent related thereto, shall be an Assumed
Liability for purposes of this Agreement to the same extent as would have been
the case had such Restricted Asset been Transferred to Buyer at Closing, and
Buyer shall indemnify Seller for all such Taxes (including any additional
amount sufficient to place Seller in the same after-Tax position as it would
have been had the Restricted Assets been actually Transferred to Buyer at
Closing), _provided_ that Seller shall cooperate, as reasonably requested by
Buyer, to minimize the amount of such Taxes, including by claiming any
available exemption or any available refund, relief, credit or other
recovery, and by executing and filing any invoices, forms or certificates
(including residency certificates) reasonably required and shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into all Contracts or other
arrangements reasonably requested by Buyer to minimize any such Tax and any
Tax imposed on Buyer as a result of the transfer of benefits under such
Restricted Assets to Buyer in accordance with this _Section 2.6_. For the
avoidance of doubt, such cooperation shall not include any change to the
operations of Seller or its Subsidiaries or require Seller or its Subsidiaries
to carry out any other restructuring activities and Buyer shall indemnify
Seller for all of its reasonable, out-of-pocket costs (including Taxes)
incurred to implement any Tax planning techniques requested by Buyer pursuant
to the preceding sentence. Once such Consent is obtained (or such other
impediment to Transfer ceases to exist), Seller shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, Transfer at Closing (or, if to be transferred in
connection with Operational Separation, at Operational Separation in the
applicable jurisdiction) or as promptly as reasonable practicable thereafter
the relevant Purchased Asset to which such Consent or other impediment to
Transfer relates to Buyer or the applicable Other Buyer (or, if to be
transferred in connection with Operational Separation, to the applicable
Purchased Entity) for no additional consideration. Applicable Transfer Taxes
and VAT in connection with such Transfer shall be paid in accordance with
_Section 6.8_. This _Section 2.6(a)_ does not relate to Shared Contracts
which are addressed in _Section 2.6(c)_ and  _Section 2.6(d)_.

(b) Each Party shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use, reasonable best efforts, and shall, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, reasonably cooperate with each other, to obtain or to cause to
be obtained any requisite Consent, substitution, or amendment required to
Transfer and novate to Buyer (or, if to be transferred in connection with
Operational Separation, the applicable Purchased Entity) all rights and
obligations of Seller and its Subsidiaries with respect to the Purchased
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities such that, in any case, Buyer (or, if to
be transferred in connection with Operational Separation, the applicable
Purchased Entity) will be solely benefited by and responsible for such rights
and obligations from and after the Closing Date (or, if to be transferred in
connection with Operational Separation, Operational Separation in the
applicable jurisdiction), in each case, other than Excluded Assets and
Excluded Liabilities and otherwise to the extent such rights and obligations
would have Transferred to Buyer at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement had
no restriction on such Transfer been imposed. Nothing in this _Section 2.6_
shall require Buyer, Seller or any of their Subsidiaries to pay any amount,
grant or alter any rights or contractual provisions, grant any guarantee or
provide any other consideration to any third party or incur additional costs
or expenses in order to obtain any such Consent or any novation, other than
general reasonable internal costs, overhead and reasonable use of internal
personnel and assets or infrastructure. Further, in no event will Seller, and
Seller shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, (A) commit to make any payments
other than cash payments that are Excluded Liabilities or otherwise paid in
full prior to the Closing or (B) make any non-monetary concession that would
purport to bind Buyer, its Subsidiaries, the Business or any Purchased
Entities following the Closing beyond that which would have otherwise
constituted an Assumed Liability had such Restricted Assets been Transferred
to Buyer at Closing. In the event that Seller determines to seek a novation
with respect to any Assigned Contract, then, subject to the same

 



32  limitations under this _Section 2.6(b)_ applicable to the Parties
obligations to seek a Consent, Buyer shall, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, reasonably cooperate with, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to reasonably cooperate with, Seller and the Other Sellers (including, where
necessary, entering into appropriate instruments of assumption) to cause such
novation to be obtained and to have Seller and the Other Sellers released
from all liability that constitutes Assumed Liabilities to third parties with
respect to such Assigned Contract, in each case, to the extent consistent with
the terms of this Agreement and with effect to occur from and after Closing.
With respect to any Assumed Liabilities for which Seller, or any Affiliate of
Seller, has any secondary liability to third parties, Buyer shall provide
Seller reasonable access and information in order for Seller to ascertain
continuing compliance by Buyer and its Subsidiaries with all material
contract terms and conditions applicable thereto. Notwithstanding anything
else set forth in this _Section 2.6_, no Party shall be required to take any
action that (i) violates any contractual obligation of such Party that is in
effect on the Agreement Date in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely impact such Party or (ii) violates applicable Law.
The obligations of each Party under this _Section 2.6(b)_ shall expire 12
months after the Closing Date except those obligations under this _Section
2.6(b)_ with respect to any Government Contract necessary or relating to the
Business, which obligations shall not expire until 24 months after the
Closing Date.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
separate the rights and obligations under each Shared Contract (other than any
Excluded Shared Contract) to the extent that they relate to the Business (a "
_Split Interest_") and Transfer to Buyer or its designee (or, if to be
transferred in connection with Operational Separation, the applicable
Purchased Entity) any Split Interest and replicate such Shared Contract for
the benefit of Buyer or its designee (or, if to be transferred in
connection with Operational Separation, the applicable Purchased Entity)
(with such replicated Contract imposing no additional or differing obligations
(except arising from different volume-based arrangements) than, and otherwise
on substantially the same terms as, the applicable Shared Contract (except
that the replicated Contract will only pertain to the Business) or other terms
mutually agreeable to the Parties in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein) such that as of the Effective Time, Buyer or
such designee (or, if to be transferred in connection with Operational
Separation, as of Operational Separation, the applicable Purchased Entity)
shall be entitled to such Split Interest and replicated Contract, each of
which, being deemed a Purchased Asset for all purposes of this Agreement,
subject to this _Section 2.6(c)_. If an attempted Transfer of a Split
Interest or replication of such Shared Contract, without the Consent of a
third party, would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights
of such third party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an
agreement concerning the applicable Shared Contract, or, unless waived by
Buyer, would in any way adversely affect the rights (except such differences
under volume-based arrangements as a result of changes to volume), upon
Transfer, of Buyer or its Subsidiaries with respect to such Split Interest, as
applicable (each, a " _Restricted Split Interest_ "), then (i) until such
Consent (or replication and transfer to Buyer or the Purchased Entity) has
occurred, such Restricted Split Interest shall not constitute a Purchased
Asset nor shall any Liability arising out of, or related to such Restricted
Split Interest constitute an Excluded Liability solely by virtue of being
Restricted Split Interests, (ii) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain all requisite Consents to Transfer to Buyer (or, if to be transferred
in connection with Operational Separation, the applicable Purchased Entity)
such Restricted Split Interest on the Closing Date (or, if to be transferred
in connection with Operational Separation, at Operational Separation for
such jurisdiction) or (to the extent not completed by such date), for 12
months after the Closing Date (or in the case of Government Contracts, 24
months after the Closing Date), as promptly thereafter as reasonably
practicable, and (iii) Buyer shall reasonably cooperate and use reasonable
best efforts to assist Seller in obtaining such Consents; _provided_ that (A)
nothing in this _Section 2.6(c)_ shall require Buyer, Seller or any of their
Subsidiaries to pay any amount, grant any rights, grant any guarantee or
provide any other consideration to any third party or incur additional costs
or expenses in order to obtain any such Consent, other than general reasonable
internal costs, overhead and reasonable use of internal personnel and assets
or infrastructure and (B) in no event will Seller, and Seller shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to,

 



33  (x) commit to make any payments other than cash payments that are Excluded
Liabilities or otherwise paid in full prior to the Closing or (y) make any
non-monetary concession that would purport to bind Buyer, its Subsidiaries,
the Business or any Purchased Entities following the Closing beyond that which
would have otherwise constituted an Assumed Liability had such Restricted
Split Interest been Transferred to Buyer at Closing. Once the Transfer of a
Split Interest and replicated Contract has occurred, and once Consent is
obtained for the Transfer of a Restricted Split Interest (including
replication of the Shared Contract relating thereto as described herein) or
such other impediment to Transfer ceases to exist, such Split Interest,
replicated Contract or Restricted Split Interest shall be Transferred to or
assumed through the replicated Contract by Buyer (but not before such time and
not before the Closing Date) (or, if to be transferred in connection with
Operational Separation, the applicable Purchased Entity) for no additional
consideration, and, in each case, the rights to such Split Interest,
replicated Contract or Restricted Split Interest shall be deemed to be a
Purchased Asset for purposes of this Agreement and the obligations (other than
Excluded Liabilities or Liabilities under a replicated Shared Contract that
deviate from the applicable Shared Contract) under such Split
Interest, replicated Contract or Restricted Split Interest that would have
otherwise constituted Assumed Liabilities at the Closing, shall, upon such
Transfer to Buyer, be deemed to be an Assumed Liability for purposes of this
Agreement to the same extent as if Transferred to Buyer at Closing;
_provided_ that at no time on or after the Closing shall the rights to any
Restricted Split Interest for which Consent has not been obtained constitute
Excluded Assets nor shall any Liability arising out of, or related to, such
Restricted Split Interest constitute an Excluded Liability solely by virtue of
being a Restricted Split Interest, in each case for purposes of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that any Liability (other than
an Excluded Liability) arising from or related to any Restricted Split
Interest on or after the Closing, including any Taxes to the extent related
thereto, shall be an Assumed Liability for purposes of this Agreement to the
same extent as would have been the case had such underlying Split Interest
been able to be Transferred to Buyer at Closing, and Buyer shall indemnify
Seller for all such Taxes (including any additional amount sufficient to place
Seller in the same after-Tax position as it would have been had the
underlying Split Interest been able to be Transferred to Buyer at Closing),
_provided_ Seller shall cooperate, as reasonably requested by Buyer, to
minimize the amount of such Taxes, including by claiming any
available exemption or any available refund, relief, credit or other
recovery, and by executing and filing any invoices, forms or certificates
(including residency certificates) reasonably required and shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into all Contracts or other arrangements
reasonably requested by Buyer to minimize any such Tax and any Tax imposed on
Buyer as a result of the transfer of benefits under such Restricted Split
Interest to Buyer in accordance with this  _Section 2.6_. For the avoidance
of doubt, such cooperation shall not include any change to the operations of
Seller or its Subsidiaries or require Seller or its Subsidiaries to carry out
any restructuring activities and Buyer shall indemnify Seller for all of its
reasonable, out-of-pocket costs (including Taxes) incurred to implement any
Tax planning techniques requested by Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, after the Agreement Date,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, (i) Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable
best efforts, not to enter into any Shared Contract (other than Contracts
obtained at the corporate parent level which are not intended to benefit or
encumber the Business disproportionately to Sellers other businesses and
entered into in the ordinary course of business) and (ii) Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, amend, modify or separate or
replicate any Shared Contract in any manner that is disproportionately adverse
to the Business, Purchased Assets or any Purchased Entity as compared to
Sellers other businesses, assets or Subsidiaries.

(d) With respect to any Retained Contract, on the Agreement Date, Buyer and
Seller have entered into a Retained Contracts Agreement in the form mutually
agreed upon and executed by the Parties (the " _Retained Contracts Agreement_
"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the
applicable Purchased Entities shall agree to, or cause its Subsidiaries to,
perform the obligations of Seller under each Retained Contract to the extent
exclusively relating to (including to provide applicable maintenance and
support for, and provide other services in respect of) the Products to or on
behalf of

 



34  Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, after the Agreement
Date, without the prior written consent of Buyer, (i) Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its Affiliates to use reasonable
best efforts, not to enter into any Retained Contract and (ii) Seller shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, amend, modify or separate or
replicate any Retained Contract in any manner that is disproportionately
adverse to the Business, Purchased Assets or any Purchased Entity as compared
to Sellers other businesses, assets or Subsidiaries.

 

(e) If any required Consent to Transfer a Restricted Asset or a Restricted
Split Interest or replicate a Shared Contract in respect of any Restricted
Split Interest is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, then, other
than with respect to an Excluded Shared Contract, for 12 months following the
Closing (or in the case of Government Contracts, 24 months after the Closing
Date), the Parties shall continue to use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain such Consent in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_ and _Section
2.6(c)_; _provided_ that from and after Closing, neither Seller nor any
Subsidiary of Seller shall be required to obtain, or make any efforts to
obtain, any Consent with respect to the Excluded Shared Contracts. The Parties
hereby further agree to implement such reasonable arrangements (including
subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting or other arrangements through the
Transaction Services Agreement or IPMA) with respect to the underlying rights
and obligations related to such Restricted Asset or Restricted Split Interest
in respect of a Shared Contracts (other than the Excluded Shared Contracts),
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, as shall enable Buyer, on and
following the Closing Date, to enjoy the benefits and detriments of the
applicable Restricted Asset or Restricted Split Interest held by Seller or
applicable Other Seller and for Buyer, from and after the Closing, to perform
(and Buyer shall agree to perform) the obligations of Seller or any applicable
Other Seller in respect thereof (to the extent they would otherwise constitute
Assumed Liabilities), for no additional consideration, and for Buyer to
assume, from and after the Closing, the payment, performance and other
obligations thereof, in each case, to provide for Buyer or the applicable
Other Buyer substantially comparable benefits, and to otherwise put Buyer and
Seller (and their respective Subsidiaries) in substantially the position they
would have been in, had such Restricted Asset or Restricted Split Interest
been transferred at the Closing (such obligations of Buyer, the "
_Subcontracted Work_ "), until the earlier of (i) such time as such Consent to
Transfer the applicable Restricted Asset or Restricted Split Interest (or
replicate and Transfer the Shared Contract (other than the Excluded Shared
Contract) in respect thereof) shall have been obtained and (ii) in the case of
a Restricted Asset that is a Contract or a Restricted Split Interest, such
time as such Contract or Restricted Split Interest shall have lapsed, expired
or not have been renewed in accordance with its terms. Buyer agrees to
diligently perform and discharge, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to perform
and discharge with certainty, the obligations of Seller and its Subsidiaries
in connection with the Subcontracted Work and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries for any Losses arising out of or relating
to (x) any Purchased Assets held by Seller or any of its Other Sellers for the
benefit of Buyer pursuant to any such arrangement and (y) any failure of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries to perform and discharge such Subcontracted Work,
in each case, except to the extent constituting Excluded Liabilities. Seller
shall be permitted to set-off against any amounts held for the benefit of
Buyer pursuant to this arrangement all direct out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including Taxes) associated with the retention and maintenance of such
Purchased Assets following the Closing. From and after the Closing, to the
extent permitted under applicable Law, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, hold in trust (or such equivalent mechanism permissible under
local Law in each relevant jurisdiction) for and exercise at the direction
of Buyer, and pay or deliver to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof (as
applicable), all benefits, rights, goods, services, income, proceeds and
monies received by, or provided to, Seller or its Affiliates to the extent
related to any Purchased Asset and/or the conduct of the Business (i) in
connection with the arrangements under this _Section 2.6(e)_ or (ii)
otherwise relating to the Restricted Assets or Restricted Split Interests;
_provided_ that the foregoing will not apply to rights, goods, services,
income, proceeds, and other monies received by Seller under any Retained
Contracts, which shall be governed solely by _Section 2.6(d)_ and the
Retained Contracts Agreement. To the extent that a Consent to Transfer to
Buyer with respect to a particular Restricted Asset or Restricted Split
Interest (or

 



35  replicated Shared Contract) is obtained after the Closing Date, the Parties
agree that such obligations relating thereto will no longer be considered to
be Subcontracted Work at such time, but, to the extent such obligations would
have been deemed to be Assumed Liabilities at the Closing had such particular
Restricted Asset or Restricted Split Interest (or replicated Shared Contract)
been Transferred at the Closing, will instead be deemed to be Assumed
Liabilities for all purposes of this Agreement. The Parties shall enter into
such reasonable arrangements, including with respect to Continuing Employees
performing services under any Restricted Asset or Restricted Split Interest,
as are necessary and appropriate to give effect to the arrangements provided
for under this _Section 2.6(e)_. This _Section 2.6(e)_ shall not apply to
any Retained Contracts, which shall be governed solely by  _Section 2.6(d)_
and the Retained Contracts Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ , prior to the
Closing, each Party shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to use, reasonable best efforts, to the extent permitted under applicable
Law, and reasonably cooperate with each other, to obtain or to cause to be
obtained any requisite Consent, substitution, or amendment required to
Transfer and novate to Buyer (or, if to be transferred in connection with
Operational Separation, the applicable Purchased Entity) all rights and
obligations of Seller and its Subsidiaries with respect to any Retained
Contract that relates exclusively to the Business (subject to the second and
third sentences of  _Section 2.6(b)_, _mutatis mutandis_ ).

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of this 
_Section 2.6_ shall not apply to any Consent required under any Antitrust
Laws, which Consents shall be governed solely by _Section 6.3_.

 

(g) Buyer acknowledges that certain Consents for the Purchase Transaction may
be required and that certain of such Consents may not be obtained.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, failures to obtain
any Consent (other than a Governmental Consent required to be obtained
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.3(f)_ or necessary
for satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_) or any
resulting termination of any Contract shall not in and of themselves,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect, a
breach by Seller of any representation, warranty or covenant under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, or a failure of any
condition under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents,
including those in _Article 7_.

 

 _Section 2.7_ _Operational Separation; Pre-Closing Restructuring_.

 

(a) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to perform restructuring
activities to effect the separation of the Business from Sellers other
businesses in order for the Business to complete Operational Separation in
each jurisdiction on or prior to the Closing (or, if not completed prior to
Closing, to continue to use its reasonable best efforts to perform such
activities in order for the Business to complete Operational Separation in
such jurisdiction as promptly as reasonable practicable thereafter), which
activities (and restrictions thereon) are described on _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of
the Disclosure Letter (as amended from time to time in accordance with this
_Section 2.7(a)_, the " _Operational Separation Activities_ "), with the
objective of effectuating the Operational Separation Activities in all
material respects on or about October 3, 2015, or as soon as reasonably
practicable (in Sellers reasonable discretion) thereafter. Seller shall not
be required to perform any Operational Separation Activity to the extent that
it would violate applicable Law or any other operational separation activity
not required by _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter. From time to time
after the Agreement Date and prior to the Closing (or Delayed Transfer
Closing, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction), Seller shall be
permitted to amend _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter (and the
exhibits thereto) without the prior consent of Buyer (i) so that the
transactions contemplated hereby do not violate applicable Law, (ii) to add
transfers of cash and cash equivalents, Excluded Assets or Excluded
Liabilities from the Purchased Entities to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
(other than a Purchased Entity) by dividend, distribution, sale, payment of
intercompany advances or Indebtedness, or other transfer, (iii) secure the
consent or approval

 



36  of a Governmental Authority, works council in non-U.S. jurisdictions or
other regulatory body to the extent necessary to complete Operational
Separation or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)
in all other circumstances not prohibited by the following sentence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment to _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the
Disclosure Letter (or the exhibits thereto) otherwise permitted
hereunder shall require the prior written consent of Buyer (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if (a) such amendment includes
any steps or actions that would cause any representation or warranty of Seller
in _Article 4_ to become (x) materially untrue or incorrect for
representations and warranties not qualified by "material" or derivations
thereof or (y) untrue or incorrect for representations and warranties
qualified by "material" or derivations thereof, (b) such amendment would
create or result in any increase in any Assumed Liabilities or any other
Liabilities or obligations of Buyer with respect to which Buyer is not
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement for the full amount
thereof (or Seller otherwise agrees to fully indemnify Buyer therefor) and
Seller acknowledges in writing such indemnity obligation (including any
incremental Transfer Taxes required to be paid by Buyer hereunder, other than
any Transfer Taxes reasonably likely to be recovered within two years by
Buyer or its Affiliates under applicable Law without material cost or expense
or restructuring or the implementation of further Tax planning techniques by
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries), (c) other than in any _de minimis_
respect, such amendment would have any adverse Tax impact on Buyer, any of its
Subsidiaries or, following the Closing, any Purchased Entities with respect to
which Buyer is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement for
the full amount thereof (or Seller otherwise agrees to fully indemnify Buyer
therefor) and Seller acknowledges in writing such indemnity obligation, (d)
other than in any _de minimis_ respect, such amendment would impose
restrictions or limitations on Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or any Purchased
Entities not otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement (taking into
account the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (e) such amendment
would create or give rise to any loans or balances (x) between any Purchased
Entity, on one hand, and another Purchased Entity, on the other hand, or (y)
between any Purchased Entity, on one hand, and Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Purchased Entities), on the other hand, in each case
that would not be canceled or terminated without further liability (other than
a _de minimis_ liability) or obligation on or before the Closing pursuant
to this Agreement (unless such amendment would not have any adverse Tax
impact on Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or, following the Closing, any
Purchased Entities, or if there would be any such adverse Tax impact, Buyer
would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement for the full
amount thereof (or Seller otherwise agrees to fully indemnify Buyer therefor)
and Seller acknowledges in writing such indemnity obligation), (f) such
amendment would (x) reduce the paid in capital, statutory capital or other
local Law equivalent with respect to any Purchased Entity below (A) the
Statutory Minimums with respect to such Purchased Entity or (B) an amount
which would result in Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
Purchased Entity) being required by applicable Law to contribute additional
capital to such Purchased Entity, or (y) result in negative equity or negative
retained earnings, distributable reserves or other local Law equivalent, (g)
such amendment would involve entering into any Contract, covenant or agreement
with any Taxing Authority that would bind Buyer, its Subsidiaries or any
Purchased Entity with respect to any period (or portion thereof) beginning on
or after the Closing Date, (h) such amendment would cause Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, any of the Purchased Entities)
to violate any Law or Contract, (i) such amendment would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation
of the Purchase Transaction in any of the Principal Jurisdictions, or (j) such
amendment would reasonably be expected to make less likely to occur the
consummation of the Purchase Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction Documents (or the satisfaction
of the conditions in _Article 7_) in any jurisdiction. Without the prior
written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed or withheld), Seller shall not take any valuation
positions in the Operational Separation Activities that are inconsistent with
the Allocation Methodology as described in and as permitted by Section 3.3
and Schedule 3.3 of the Disclosure Letter. Subject to the foregoing provisions
of this _Section 2.7(a)_ and the provisions of _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the
Disclosure Letter, Seller may consummate such Operational Separation
Activities at any time prior to the Closing Date for

 



37  consideration or for no consideration, including the issuance of debt or
equity interests in any entities involved in any such Operational Separation
Activities, as may be determined by Seller in its sole discretion. Seller
shall reasonably respond to reasonable questions by Buyer regarding the status
of the Operational Separation Activities and progress regarding the
achievement of Operational Separation.

 

(b) With respect to any material amendments to _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the
Disclosure Letter proposed by Seller that do not require Buyers consent
pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_, to the extent reasonably practicable, Seller
shall in good faith consult with Buyer as to such proposed amendment. To the
extent Buyer has any reasonable concerns with any such amendment proposed by
Seller, Buyer shall provide to Seller any information reasonably available to
Buyer that is reasonably requested in writing by Seller to enable Seller to
understand the impact of such amendment on Buyer, its Subsidiaries or any
Purchased Entity, and Seller shall consider in good faith suggestions by
Buyer. Any executed documents, instruments or certificates (or forms thereof)
to implement Operational Separation that affect or that would Transfer
Purchased Assets or assets of a Purchased Entity (X) other than in any _de
minimis_ respect, shall not impose Liabilities, restrictions or limitations on
Buyer, its Subsidiaries or the Purchased Entities not expressly contemplated
by this Agreement (taking into account the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Buyer) and
(Y) shall be made available to Buyer reasonably promptly following their
completion. The form business transfer agreement to be used to effect the
transactions contemplated by the Step Plan shall be mutually agreed by the
Parties.

(c) Further, to the extent Operational Separation is not completed in a
particular jurisdiction (other than a Principal Jurisdiction) as of the
Closing, the Parties shall, in accordance with _Appendix H_ , delay the
Closing of the Purchase Transaction with respect to the Purchased Entities,
Purchased Assets and/or Assumed Liabilities related to such jurisdiction
(each, a " _Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction_ " and the Closing of the Purchase
Transaction therein, a " _Delayed Transfer Closing_ ") until such time as
Operational Separation has been completed in such jurisdiction in all material
respects. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will any Principal
Jurisdiction be a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction without the written consent
of Buyer.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
applicable Law, no action taken by Seller in accordance with _Section 2.7_
in and of itself will be deemed to violate any provision of _Section 6.1(a)_.

 

ARTICLE 3

PURCHASE PRICE

 

 _Section 3.1_ _Purchase Price_. The total consideration for the Purchased
Shares and the Purchased Assets shall consist of (a) an amount equal to
$8,000,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ "), as adjusted pursuant to _Section
3.5_ and _Section 3.6_, payable as described in this Agreement, and (b) the
assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities. VAT or Transfer Taxes payable
in connection with the consummation of the Purchase Transaction and the
transfer of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets pursuant to this
Agreement are addressed in  _Section 6.8_ and _Section 10.3_.

_Section 3.2_ _Payment of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) On the Closing Date (or in the event the Closing Date is January 1, 2016,
then on January 4, 2016), Buyer shall pay, or caused to be paid (including
through an Other Buyer), an amount equal to the sum of (1) the Purchase Price,
_minus_ (2) the Estimated Business Indebtedness, _plus_ (3) the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment Amount (such amount, the " _Estimated
Consideration_ ") to Seller

 



38 _ _ (for its own account and as agent for any Other Seller unless otherwise
provided in any Local Transfer Agreement). Such Estimated Consideration shall
be payable in United States dollars in immediately available federal funds
and delivered by, or on behalf of, Buyer (or an applicable Other Buyer) to
such bank account or accounts as shall be designated in writing by Seller no
later than the second Business Day prior to the Closing (or such later time
as may be agreed by Seller and Buyer). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
portion of the Estimated Consideration is required under applicable Law to be
paid in a currency other than United States dollars and/or to a
specific Other Seller, the applicable United States dollar amount (as
allocated pursuant to _Section 3.3_ or otherwise mutually agreed by the
Parties) shall be converted into the applicable other currency at the
Designated Exchange Rate and paid by, or on behalf of, Buyer or the
applicable Other Buyer to Seller or the appropriate Other Seller by wire
transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by Seller no later
than the second Business Day prior to the Closing (or such later time as may
be agreed by Seller and Buyer) in lieu of the payment of such amount in United
States dollars pursuant to this _Section 3.2(a)_. As used herein, "
_Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ " shall mean, (i) if the amount
of the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Closing Net
Working Capital Upper Collar, the dollar amount of such difference (expressed
as a positive number) and (ii) if the amount of the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital is less than the Closing Net Working Capital Lower Collar, the
dollar amount of such difference (expressed as a negative number). __

 

(b) No later than five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a written statement (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ ") which will set forth Sellers good faith
estimate of (i) the estimated amount of Business Indebtedness outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Estimated Business
Indebtedness_ ") and (ii) the estimated amount of Closing Net Working Capital
(the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ "), including the calculation
thereof, in each case (A) calculated in accordance with this Agreement and
GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the principles, policies and
methodologies used in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements, as
modified by the principles set forth on  _Appendix F_ (collectively, the "
_Calculation Principles_ ") and (B) together with supporting documentation
used by Seller in calculating such amount and such other documentation as
Buyer may reasonably request. In the event the Closing Date is January 1,
2016, then (i) on December 31, 2015, Buyer shall deliver evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Seller that it will have cash in an aggregate amount equal to
or greater than the Financing which will be available to Buyer on January 4,
2016 to pay the Estimated Consideration and (ii) within five Business Days
following the Determination Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to
$500,000 as interest on the Purchase Price from the Closing Date to January
4, 2016.

_Section 3.3_ _Allocation of Purchase Price_. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Seller, on behalf of itself and the Other Sellers, and
Buyer, on behalf of itself and Other Buyers, have agreed to allocate the Final
Consideration, the amount of Assumed Liabilities and other relevant amounts
among the Purchased Shares (and to the extent required or permitted by
applicable Tax Law, the underlying assets held by any Purchased Entity or
Purchased Minority Interest) and the Purchased Assets (and to the extent
required or permitted by applicable Tax Law, the non-competition covenant
contained in _Section 6.10_ and any licenses acquired pursuant to this
Agreement) (collectively, the " _Section 3.3 Assets_"), in a manner
consistent with Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code (as applicable) (and any
other applicable Tax Law) (for the avoidance of doubt, an allocation different
than an allocation under Section 1060 may be required by applicable Tax Law to
be taken for local country Tax purposes) and the methodology set forth in
_Schedule 3.3_ of the Disclosure Letter (the " _Allocation Methodology_ ").
Buyer and Seller shall agree on a preliminary allocation of the Purchase
Price, the Assumed Liabilities and other relevant amounts (the " _Preliminary
Allocation_ ") prior to the Closing Date among the Section 3.3 Assets, in a
manner consistent with Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code (and any other
applicable Tax Law), the Allocation Methodology and this _Section 3.3_. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a statement (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") which shall allocate the
Final

 



39  Consideration, Assumed Liabilities and other relevant amounts among the
Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets (and, where appropriate, the assets
of any Purchased Entity or Purchased Minority Interest) as of the Effective
Time in accordance with the allocation requirements of Sections 1060 and 338
of the Code (as applicable) (and any other applicable Tax Law) among the
Section 3.3 Assets (the " _Allocation_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agree that the Allocation Statement
(and computation of the Allocation) will be consistent with the methodologies,
policies and principles of the Allocation Methodology and used in the
Preliminary Allocation. If, within 20 Business Days after the delivery of the
Allocation Statement, Buyer notifies Seller that Buyer objects to the
Allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller shall seek
in good faith to resolve such dispute within 20 Business Days. In the event
that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within 20 Business
Days, Seller and Buyer shall jointly retain a nationally
recognized accounting firm to resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of
the disputed items, the Allocation reflected on the Allocation Statement shall
be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The fees and expenses of the
accounting firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. In the event that
Buyer notifies Seller that it accepts the Allocation Statement, or does not
notify Seller of any objections to the Allocation Statement during such 20
Business Day period, Buyer shall be considered to have accepted the accuracy
of the Allocation Statement delivered by Seller and such Allocation Statement
(and the Allocation set forth therein) shall be final, conclusive and binding
upon the Parties. Any adjustments to the Final Consideration paid by Buyer in
consideration for the sale and purchase of the Purchased Shares and the
Purchased Assets (including any adjustments made pursuant to _Section 3.5_)
shall be reflected in the Allocation Statement in a manner consistent with
the Allocation Methodology, Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (and any other similar provisions under
applicable Tax Law) and, subject to foregoing, as mutually agreed by the
Parties (it being understood that no Party will unreasonably withhold,
condition or delay such agreement). In the event that an adjustment to the
Final Consideration is made pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall
use their reasonable best efforts to mutually agree to an allocation of any
such post-Closing adjustment in a manner consistent with the Allocation and
this _Section 3.3_. For all Tax purposes, Seller and Buyer agree to report,
and cause their respective Subsidiaries to report, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Allocation, and
will not take, or permit their respective Subsidiaries to take, any position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return in any audit or refund claim, in
any litigation or otherwise, unless required to do so by a Taxing Authority.
In addition, Seller and Buyer shall, and cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, act in accordance with the Allocation Statement (and the Allocation set
forth therein) in the course of any Tax audit, Tax review or Tax litigation
relating thereto, and take no position and cause their Subsidiaries not to
take any position inconsistent with the Allocation Statement (or the
Allocation set forth therein) for Income Tax purposes in any jurisdiction,
unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code or other similar provision under applicable Tax
Law. Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for the preparation of their
own Section 1060 and 338 statements (and analogous foreign statements, as
applicable) and forms in accordance with applicable Tax Laws and in a manner
consistent with the Allocation Statement (and the Allocation set forth
therein), and each shall execute and deliver to each other such statements and
forms as are reasonably requested by the other Party. In the event that the
Allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, (a) the Party receiving notice
of the dispute shall promptly notify the other Party of such notice and (b)
both Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to defend the Allocation in
any Proceedings or settle such dispute in a manner mutually acceptable to
Seller and Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall each instruct their employees and
Representatives to cooperate with, and promptly respond to all reasonable
requests and inquiries of, the other, and to provide, upon execution of a
customary access letter if required by Sellers or Buyers (as applicable)
outside accountants, Buyer and its Representatives or Seller and its
Representatives (as applicable) with reasonable access during normal business
hours, and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of the other Partys business, upon reasonable notice, to all relevant work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by the other to the
extent such materials have been prepared and relate to the Allocation in any
respect or questions concerning or

 



40  disagreements with the Allocation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties
shall respect the Allocation agreed upon pursuant to this _Section 3.3_ with
respect to the Purchased Assets sold by Other Sellers that are organized in
the Peoples Republic of China and for the sale of Purchased Shares of
Purchased Entities that are organized in the Peoples Republic of China and in
no event shall the Parties adjust the Allocation with respect to such
Purchased Assets or Purchased Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and
Seller agree that, for purposes of the Allocation only (and not Appendix C),
the amount of any Deferred Revenue included in the Assumed Liabilities shall
be zero, and that no cash payment is being made actually or constructively by
Seller to Buyer for the assumption of any such Deferred Revenue.

 

 _Section 3.4_ _Title Passage; Delivery of Purchased Shares and Purchased
Assets_.

 

(a) _Title Passage_. Upon the Closing (or, with respect to a Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing), all of the right, title and
interest of Seller, (including any risk of loss) in and to all of the
Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets shall pass to Buyer or such Other
Buyer; _provided_ that Buyer may elect to require Seller to convey any of
the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets to an Other Buyer, and Seller
shall comply with any such election. At Closing (or, with respect to a Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing), Seller shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to Buyer or an Other Buyer, as applicable, (i)(1) to
the extent that such Purchased Shares are in certificated form, certificates
evidencing the Purchased Shares duly endorsed in blank or with stock powers
duly executed in proper form for transfer, or any other equivalent or
alternative procedure required under local Law to effect valid transfer of the
Purchased Shares, (2) to the extent that such Purchased Shares are not in
certificated form, stock powers or other instruments of transfer duly
executed in blank, and (3) in either case, any short-form equity transfer
agreements, forms, notarial deeds, instruments or other similar documents
necessary to transfer to Buyer or the applicable Other Buyer the
Purchased Shares in accordance with the Laws of the jurisdiction of
organization, incorporation or formation of such Purchased Entities or
Purchased Minority Interests (including any necessary notarizations,
legalizations or other attestation and execution formalities to the extent
required by applicable Law), in each case, in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Parties and with any appropriate stock transfer stamps affixed thereto, or
other equivalent or alternative procedure required under local Law to effect
valid transfer of the Purchased Shares (the items described in clauses (1)
through (3), collectively, the " _Equity Transfer Documents_ "), (ii)
possession of the Purchased Assets and (iii) the Other Transfer Documents
required to convey to Buyer or an Other Buyer, as applicable, good and
marketable title to all of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets, free
and clear of all Liens, other than, in the case of Purchased Assets,
Permitted Liens and Liens arising under the Assumed Debt. Where the operation
of applicable Law requires that any obligation of Seller or Other Seller to
perfect the transfer of title to the Purchased Shares or Purchased Asset to
Buyer or the applicable Other Buyer can only be satisfied following Closing
(or, with respect to a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer
Closing), Seller shall take, or cause the applicable Other Seller to take, all
such actions as may be required as soon as reasonably practicable following
Closing (or, with respect to a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed
Transfer Closing).

(b)  _Method of Delivery of Purchased Shares and Purchased Assets_. The
Purchased Shares shall be delivered to Buyer or an Other Buyer, as applicable,
in the manner described in _Section 3.4(a)_. The Purchased Assets shall be
delivered to Buyer or an Other Buyer, as applicable, in the form and to the
location reasonably directed by Buyer and (if any location other than their
respective location as of immediately prior to Closing (or, with respect to a
Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing)) consented to by
Seller before the Closing Date (or, with respect to a Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing); _provided_ , _that_ , to the
extent practicable, Seller shall deliver all of the Transferred Technology
through electronic delivery or in another reasonable manner reasonably
calculated and legally permitted to minimize or avoid the incurrence of any
Transfer Taxes and VAT if such method of delivery does not adversely
affect costs (including Taxes) of Seller, Buyer or their respective
Subsidiaries, or the condition, operability or usefulness or benefit of any
Purchased Asset to Buyer or its Subsidiaries.

 



41 _Section 3.5_ _Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment; Other
Adjustment_. 

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event within 60 Business Days
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a
written statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") which will set forth Buyers
good faith determination of the following: (i) the Business Cash Surplus
Amount (the " _Closing Business Cash Surplus Amount_ ") or the Business Cash
Deficit Amount (the " _Closing Business Cash Deficit Amount_ "), (ii) the
amount of Business Indebtedness outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Closing Business Indebtedness_ ") and (iii) the amount
of Closing Net Working Capital, including the calculation thereof. The items
set forth on the Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
Calculation Principles and this Agreement. With respect to any items and
amounts in the Estimated Closing Statement which are not disputed by Buyer in
the Closing Statement, Buyer shall have deemed to have agreed with such items
and amounts in the Estimated Closing Statement. From the Closing Date through
the Determination Date, Seller shall give, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
give, and instruct its representatives and auditors to give (upon execution by
Buyer and its representatives of a customary access letter if required by
Sellers outside accountants), Buyer and its Subsidiaries, and its
representatives and auditors, upon reasonable advance notice, all such
reasonable access (including electronic access, to the extent reasonably
available) during normal business hours (or such other times as the Parties
may agree) and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of Sellers or its Subsidiaries business, as Buyer may
reasonably require to the books and records of Seller or its Subsidiaries and
to personnel or representatives of Seller (including but not limited to
finance personnel) for any purpose relating to the determination of the
Closing Statement and the adjustments contemplated by this _Section 3.5_
(all such information shall be deemed Confidential Information of Seller and
therefore subject to _Section 6.2(b)_ ).

 

(b) From the Closing Date through the Determination Date, Buyer shall give,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to give, and instruct its representatives
and auditors to give (upon execution by Seller and its representatives of a
customary access letter if required by Buyers outside accountants), Seller
and its Subsidiaries, and its representatives and auditors, upon
reasonable advance notice, all such reasonable access (including electronic
access, to the extent reasonably available) during normal business hours (or
such other times as the Parties may agree) and in a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of Buyers or its Subsidiaries
business, as Seller may reasonably require to the books and records of the
Business and to the appropriate Continuing Employees and other personnel or
representatives of Buyer (including but not limited to finance personnel) for
any purpose relating to the determination of the Closing Statement and the
adjustments contemplated by this _Section 3.5_ (all such information shall be
deemed Confidential Information of Buyer and therefore subject to _Section
6.2(c)_).

(c) Within 45 Business Days after Sellers receipt of the Closing
Statement, Seller shall notify Buyer whether it accepts or disputes the
accuracy of the Closing Statement. In the event that Seller disputes the
accuracy of the Closing Statement, Seller shall deliver a written notice to
Buyer specifying in reasonable detail those items and amounts as to which
Seller disagrees and setting forth Sellers calculation of such disputed
amounts (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") and Seller shall be deemed to have agreed
with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement. In the
event that Seller notifies Buyer that it accepts the Closing Statement, or
does not deliver a Dispute Notice to Buyer, during such 45 Business Day
period, Seller shall be considered to have accepted the accuracy of the
Closing Statement delivered by Buyer and such Closing Statement shall be
final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties, absent fraud.

 



42 (d) If a Dispute Notice shall be timely delivered by Seller pursuant to 
_Section 3.5(c)_ above, Seller and Buyer shall, during the 20 Business Days
following such delivery (as such time period may be extended by the mutual
agreement of the Parties), seek in good faith to reach agreement on the
disputed items and amounts. During such 20 Business Day period and until the
final determination of the Closing Business Indebtedness, the Closing Business
Cash Surplus Amount, the Closing Business Cash Deficit Amount and the Closing
Net Working Capital in accordance with this _Section 3.5_, Seller and its
representatives shall be provided with such access to the books and records of
the Business and the Continuing Employees as it may reasonably request to
enable it to address all matters set forth in any Dispute Notice as described
in _Section 3.5(c)_. If Buyer and Seller resolve their differences over the
disputed items in the Closing Statement in accordance with the foregoing
procedure, the Closing Statement shall be revised to reflect such resolution
and the amount of the Closing Business Indebtedness, the Closing Business Cash
Surplus Amount, the Closing Business Cash Deficit Amount and the Closing Net
Working Capital agreed upon by Seller and Buyer as reflected in such revised
Closing Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties,
absent fraud.

(e) If the Parties fail to resolve their differences over the disputed items
and amounts in the Closing Statement within such 20 Business Day period (as
such time period may be extended by the mutual agreement of the Parties), then
Buyer and Seller shall forthwith jointly request that Grant Thornton LLP, or
if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm as shall be mutually agreed by the Parties
(the " _Independent Accountant_ "), make a binding determination only as to
the disputed items and amounts in the Closing Statement in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The Independent Accountant will under the terms of
its engagement have no more than 20 Business Days from the date of referral
within which to render its written decision with respect to such disputed
items and amounts. The Independent Accountant shall consider only those items
or amounts in the Closing Statement as to which Seller and Buyer are
in disagreement. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to Seller and Buyer
a written report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the Closing
Statement based on the Independent Accountants determination with respect to
the disputed items and amounts in accordance with this Agreement and the
Calculation Principles and such report shall include the calculations
supporting such adjustments; _provided_ that the Independent Accountant may
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by one of the Parties. Such report shall be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be allocated to be paid by Buyer and Seller in
inverse proportion (based on the disputed amounts proposed by each to the
Independent Accountant) as they may each prevail on matters resolved by
the Independent Accountant, which proportionate allocations shall also be
determined by the Independent Accountant at the time the determination of the
Independent Accountant is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.
Promptly after any matter is referred to the Independent Accountant under
this _Section 3.5(e)_, Seller and Buyer shall deliver to the Independent
Accountant copies of any schedules or documentation that may reasonably be
required or requested by the Independent Accountant to make its
determination. Each of Buyer and Seller shall be entitled to submit to the
Independent Accountant a memorandum setting forth its position with respect to
the disputed items.

 

(f) The date on which the Closing Statement is finally determined in
accordance with this _Section 3.5_ shall be referred to as the "
_Determination Date_ " and the Closing Statement as so finally determined
shall be referred to as the " _Final Closing Statement_ " and each of the
Closing Business Cash Surplus Amount, the Closing Business Cash Deficit
Amount, the Closing Business Indebtedness and the Closing Net Working Capital,
as so finally determined in the Final Closing Statement shall be referred to
as the " _Final Business Cash Surplus Amount_ ", " _Final Business Cash
Deficit Amount_ " the " _Final Business Indebtedness_ " and the " _Final
Closing Net Working Capital_ ", respectively. As used herein, (i) the "
_Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ " shall mean, (1) if the amount of
the Final Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Closing Net Working
Capital Upper Collar, the dollar

 



43  amount of such difference (expressed as a positive number) and (2) if the
amount of the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Closing Net
Working Lower Collar, the dollar amount of such difference (expressed as a
negative number), and (ii) the " _Final Consideration_ " shall mean an amount
equal to the sum of (A) the Purchase Price, _plus_ (B) the Final Business Cash
Surplus Amount (if any), _minus_ (C) the Final Business Cash Deficit Amount
(if any), _minus_ (D) the Final Business Indebtedness, _plus_ (E) the Final

(g) Within five Business Days following the Determination Date, (i) if the
Estimated Consideration exceeds the Final Consideration (the amount of such
excess, the " _Negative Adjustment Amount_ "), Seller shall pay, or caused to
be paid, to Buyer the Negative Adjustment Amount or (ii) if the Final
Consideration exceeds the Estimated Consideration (the amount of such excess,
the " _Positive Adjustment Amount_ "), Buyer shall pay, or caused to be paid,
to Seller the Positive Adjustment Amount. Any payment under this _Section
3.5(g)_ shall be payable in United States dollars in immediately available
federal funds and delivered to such bank account or accounts as shall be
designated in writing by the receiving party and such payments shall be
accompanied by interest at a fixed annual rate equal to the rate of
interest from time to time announced publicly by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.

elapsed between the Closing Date and the payment date based on a 365-day year;
_provided_ ,  _that_ , if any portion of the Negative Adjustment Amount or
Positive Adjustment Amount (or interest thereon) is required under applicable
Law to be paid in a currency other than United States dollars and/or to a
specific Other Seller or Other Buyer, such applicable United States dollar
amount shall be converted into the applicable other currency at the Designated
Exchange Rate and paid by, or on behalf of, Buyer or Seller (as applicable) to
the other (or the appropriate Other Buyer or Other Seller, as applicable) by
wire transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by Buyer or
Seller (as applicable) no later than the second Business Day prior to the date
of payment (or such later time as may be agreed by Seller and Buyer) in lieu
of the payment of such amount in United States dollars pursuant to this
_Section 3.5(g)_.

(h) The process set forth in _Section 3.5(e)_ shall be the exclusive remedy
of Seller and Buyer for any disputes related to any amounts set forth on the
Closing Statement.

 

 _Section 3.6_ _Net Pension Liabilities Adjustment Amount_

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the completion of the assumption of
the Business Retirement Plans set forth on _Schedule 3.6_ of the Disclosure
Letter by Buyer and the transfers of the assets and obligations of the
Applicable Seller Retirement Plans corresponding to the Business Retirement
Plans set forth on _Schedule 3.6_ of the Disclosure Letter, in each case,
as contemplated by _Section 6.6(x)_, but in no event more than one year
after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement
(the " _Estimated Pension Statement_ ") that sets forth (together
with information to demonstrate how it determined such amount, including the
names of the Business Retirement Plans and the associated Transferred Pension
Liabilities, Transferred Pension Assets and Net Pension Liabilities respecting
each such plan) the estimated amount of Net Pension Liabilities (the "
_Estimated Net Pension Liabilities_ ") and the amount of Estimated Net Pension
Liabilities Adjustment Amount. As used herein, " _Estimated Net Pension
Liabilities Adjustment Amount_ " means, (i) if the amount of the Estimated
Net Pension Liabilities is greater than the Net Pension Liabilities Target,
the dollar amount of such difference (rounded to the nearest whole dollar) and
(ii) if the amount of the Estimated Net Pension Liabilities is less than the
Net Pension Liabilities Target, the dollar amount of such difference (rounded
to the nearest whole dollar). In connection with Sellers preparation of the
Estimated Pension Statement, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Purchased
Entities and their Subsidiaries to, provide reasonable access, during normal
business hours and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of Buyers or its Subsidiaries business, and upon reasonable advance
notice, to their employees and all work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents which are relevant to the preparation of the Estimated 

 



44  Pension Statement (which access shall be provided promptly after request by
Seller and/or its representatives), subject to execution of a customary access
letter if required by Buyers outside accountants. For purposes of this
Agreement, Net Pension Liabilities shall be determined on the basis of the
methodology, assumptions and procedures set forth on _Appendix G_ (the "
_Pension Calculation Principles_ ").

(b) Within 60 Business Days after Buyers receipt of the Estimated Pension
Statement, Buyer shall notify Seller whether it accepts or disputes the
accuracy of the Estimated Pension Statement. In connection with Buyers review
of the Estimated Pension Statement, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide reasonable access, during normal business hours and
in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of Sellers
or its Subsidiaries business, and upon reasonable advance notice, to its
employees and all work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents and
supporting material which are relevant to the accuracy of the Estimated
Pension Statement (which access shall be provided promptly after request by
Buyer and/or its Representatives), subject to execution of a customary access
letter if required by Sellers outside accountants. In the event that Buyer
disputes the Estimated Pension Statement, Buyer shall deliver a written notice
to Seller specifying in reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which
Buyer disagrees and setting forth Buyers calculation of such disputed
amounts (a " _Pension Dispute Notice_ ") and Buyer shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Estimated Pension
Statement. In the event that Buyer notifies Seller that it accepts the
Estimated Pension Statement, or does not deliver a Pension Dispute Notice to
Seller during such 60 Business Day period, Buyer shall be considered to have
accepted the accuracy of the Estimated Pension Statement delivered by Seller
and such Estimated Pension Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding
upon the Parties and the Estimated Net Pension Liabilities Adjustment Amount
(as calculated based thereon) shall be deemed to be the Final Net Pension
Liabilities Adjustment, absent fraud.

(c) If a Pension Dispute Notice shall be timely delivered by Buyer pursuant
to  _Section 3.6(b)_ above, Buyer and Seller shall, during the 20 Business
Days following such delivery (as such time period may be extended by the
mutual agreement of the Parties), seek in good faith to reach agreement on the
disputed items and amounts. If Buyer and Seller resolve their differences
over the disputed items and amounts in the Estimated Pension Statement in
accordance with the foregoing procedure, the Estimated Pension Statement shall
be revised to reflect such resolution and the amount of the Net Pension
Liabilities agreed upon by Seller and Buyer as reflected in such revised
Estimated Pension Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties, absent fraud.

 

(d) If the Parties fail to resolve their differences over the amount of Net
Pension Liabilities and the calculation thereof in the Estimated Pension
Statement within such 20 Business Day period (or such extended time period as
may be agreed by the Parties), then Buyer and Seller shall forthwith jointly
request a nationally recognized independent actuarial firm as shall be
mutually agreed by the Parties (the " _Independent Actuary_ "), make a
binding determination only as to the amount of Net Pension Liabilities in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Independent Actuary will
under the terms of its engagement have no more than 20 Business Days (or such
extended time period as may be agreed by the Parties) from the date of
referral within which to render its written decision with respect to such
disputed amount. The Independent Actuary shall consider only the disputed
items or amounts. The Independent Actuary shall deliver to Seller and Buyer a
written report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the Estimated Pension
Statement based on the Independent Actuarys determination with respect to
the disputed items or amounts in accordance with the Pension Calculation
Principles (and without regard to any determination of whether such principles
are appropriate in the circumstances) and such report shall include
the calculations supporting such adjustments; _provided_ that the Independent
Actuary may not assign a value to any item or amount greater than the greatest
value for such item or amount claimed by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such item or amount claimed by one of the Parties. Such

 



45  report shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent fraud
or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Independent Actuary shall be
allocated to be paid by Buyer and Seller in inverse proportion (based on the
disputed amounts proposed by each to the Independent Actuary) as they may each
prevail on matters resolved by the Independent Actuary, which proportionate
allocations shall also be determined by the Independent Actuary at the time
the determination of the Independent Actuary is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted.

(e) The date on which the Estimated Pension Statement is finally determined
in accordance with this _Section 3.6_ shall be referred to as the " _Pension
Determination Date_ " and the amount of Net Pension Liabilities as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 3.6_ shall be referred
to as the " _Final Net Pension Liabilities_ ". As used herein, the " _Final
Net Pension Liabilities Adjustment Amount_ " shall mean, (i) if the amount of
the Final Net Pension Liabilities is greater than the Net Pension Liabilities
Target, the dollar amount of such difference (rounded to the nearest whole
dollar) and (ii) if the amount of the Final Net Pension Liabilities is less
than the Net Pension Liabilities Target, the dollar amount of such difference
(rounded to the nearest whole dollar).

 

(f) Within five Business Days following the Pension Determination Date, (i) if
the amount of Final Net Pension Liabilities is greater than the Net Pension
Liabilities Target, Seller shall pay to Buyer such Final Net Pension
Liabilities Adjustment Amount or (ii) if the amount of the Final Net Pension
Liabilities is less than the Net Pension Liabilities Target, Buyer shall
pay to Seller such Final Net Pension Liabilities Adjustment Amount. Any
payment under this _Section 3.6(f)_ shall be payable in United States dollars
in immediately available federal funds and delivered to such bank account or
accounts as shall be designated in writing by the receiving party; _provided_
, _that_ , if any portion of the Final Net Pension Liabilities Adjustment
Amount is required under applicable Law to be paid in a currency other than
United States dollars and/or to a specific Other Seller or Other Buyer, such
applicable United States dollar amount shall be converted into the applicable
other currency at the Designated Exchange Rate and paid by, or on behalf of,
Buyer or Seller (as applicable) to the other (or the appropriate Other Buyer
or Other Seller, as applicable) by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts
designated in writing by Buyer or Seller (as applicable) no later than the
second Business Day prior to the date of payment (or such later time as may
be agreed by Seller and Buyer) in lieu of the payment of such amount in United
States dollars pursuant to this _Section 3.6(f)_.

 

 _Section 3.7_ _Withholding_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Party shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld under applicable Law (such Party that deducts and
withholds, the " _Withholding Party_ "). The Withholding Party shall timely
pay the full amount so deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental
Authority, in accordance with applicable Law. As soon as practicable after any
such payment, the Withholding Party shall deliver to the other Party the
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by the relevant Governmental
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment
or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such other Party.

 

(b) The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to identify jurisdictions that
may trigger withholding taxes under this _Section 3.7_ and shall consult
with each other in good faith as to the nature of such withholding Taxes so
identified and the basis upon which such withholding is required or if any
reasonable steps can be taken to claim an exemption from such withholding
Taxes;  _provided_ that, in no event shall a failure to provide any notice by
Buyer or the level at which Buyer has consulted with Seller give rise to any
additional liability by Buyer for such withholding Taxes. Seller shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate in good faith taking

 



46  reasonable measures available to it or them to minimize any withholding that
may be applied to any payments described in this _Section 3.7_. For the
avoidance of doubt, such reasonable measures shall not include any change to
the operations of either Party (or any of its Subsidiaries) or require either
Party (or any of its Subsidiaries) to carry out any restructuring activities
or implement any Tax planning techniques.

 

(c) To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld under this _Section
3.7_, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents as having been paid by the Withholding Party
to the other Party to the extent so paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authority.

 

(d) If following the Closing a Taxing Authority asserts that there is a
requirement to make a deduction or withholding from any part of the Purchase
Price payable for the Purchased Assets or the Purchased Shares under this
Agreement for or on account of any Tax incurred, suffered or sustained by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries on or in respect of the sale of the
Purchased Assets or the Purchased Shares, and Buyer has not made such
deduction or withholding, such matter shall be treated as a Tax controversy
under _Section 6.8(g)_, and if the Taxing Authority ultimately prevails or
the Parties otherwise agree that such amount must be paid, Seller shall
either pay the Taxing Authority directly or indemnify Buyer for the applicable
amount of Taxes paid by Buyer or the applicable Other Buyer.

contribution to any standards setting organization that requires or creates
obligations that it license or offer a license to any Transferred Intellectual

(a) Buyer has delivered to Seller a true, accurate and complete copy of (i)
the executed commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement Date, by and among
Buyer and lenders party thereto (including the assignees thereof, the "
_Lenders_ "), including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and

 



69  amendments thereto (the " _Debt Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which,
and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have committed,
on a several but not joint basis, to lend the amounts set forth therein to
Buyer for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (such committed financing, together with, unless the context
otherwise requires, any debt securities issued in lieu thereof, the " _Debt
Financing_ "), (ii) an executed commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement
Date, by and between Buyer and Carlyle-Havasu Cayman Holdings, L.P., a Cayman
Islands exempted limited partnership (" _C-H Holdings_ "), including all
exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto (the " _C-H Holdings
Equity Financing Commitment_ "), (iii) an executed commitment letter, dated as
of the Agreement Date, by and between Buyer and GIC, including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments thereto (the " _GIC Equity Financing
Commitment_ " and, together with the C-H Holdings Equity Financing Commitment,
the " _Buyer Equity Commitments_ "), and (iv) an executed commitment letter,
dated as of the Agreement Date, by and between C-H Holdings and Sponsor,
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto (the "
_Sponsor Equity Financing Commitment_ " and, together with the Buyer Equity
Commitments, the " _Equity Financing Commitments_ ", and the Equity Financing
Commitments and the Debt Financing Commitment, collectively, the " _Financing
Commitments_ "). Pursuant to the Sponsor Equity Financing Commitment, and
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Sponsor has committed to
provide the amounts set forth therein to C-H Holdings for the purpose of
funding the amounts contemplated by the C-H Holdings Equity Financing
Commitment (the " _Sponsor Equity Financing_ "). C-H Holdings and GIC have
each committed, on a several but not joint basis, to provide the amounts set
forth in its respective Buyer Equity Commitment, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to Buyer for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Buyer Equity Financing_ " and,
together with the Sponsor Equity Financing, the " _Equity Financing_ and,
together with both the Buyer Equity Financing and the Debt Financing, the "
_Financing_ ").

(b) As of the Agreement Date, (i) the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect and have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect, (ii) each of the Debt Financing Commitment
and the Buyer Equity Commitments, in the form so delivered, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, and, to the knowledge of Buyer,
the other parties thereto, enforceable against it or them, as the case may be,
in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be affected by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, and
general equitable principles and (iii) the Sponsor Equity Commitment, in the
form so delivered, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of C-H
Holdings and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto,
enforceable against it or them, as the case may be, in accordance with its
terms except as enforceability may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, and general equitable
principles. Except for fee letters with respect to fees and related
arrangements with respect to the Debt Financing, of which Buyer has delivered
true, accurate and complete copies to Seller on or prior to the Agreement Date
(redacted to remove certain information (none of which could adversely affect
the amount, availability or conditionality of the Debt Financing) in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Debt Financing Sources) and customary
engagement letters and fee rebate letters, the Financing Commitments are the
only agreements relating to the Debt Financing as of the Agreement Date.
Other than as expressly set forth in such Financing Commitments and customary
engagement letters and fee rebate letters, there are no other agreements, side
letters, or arrangements relating to the Financing Commitments that could
adversely affect the amount, availability or conditionality of the Debt
Financing or the Equity Financing. The Equity Financing Commitments provide
that Seller is an express third-party beneficiary in connection with Buyers
exercise of its rights under _Section 11.7_ of this Agreement, and that
Buyer agrees not to oppose the grant of an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief in connection with the exercise of such third party
rights.

 



70 (c) As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Buyer under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments or, to
the knowledge of Buyer, would (i) make any of the assumptions or any of the
statements set forth in the Financing Commitments inaccurate in any material
respect, (ii) result in any of the conditions in the Financing Commitments not
being satisfied or (iii) otherwise result in the Financing not being available
on the Closing Date. As of the Agreement Date, no Investor or Lender party to
any Debt Financing Commitment has notified Buyer in writing of its intention
to terminate any of the Financing Commitments or not to provide the Financing.
Assuming satisfaction of the conditions in  _Section 7.1_ and _Section
7.3_, as of the Agreement Date, Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions in the Financing Commitments will fail to be satisfied on a timely
basis or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Financing
Commitments will not be available to be funded at the Closing.

(d) Buyer has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees
or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before
the Agreement Date. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all
of the financing required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are sufficient in amount for
Buyer to pay the Purchase Price and all associated fees, costs and expenses in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Financing (the " _Required Amount_ "). The Financing Commitments contain all
of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to
make the Financing available to Buyer on the terms and subject only to the
conditions set forth therein.

(e) Buyers obligation to consummate the Purchase Transaction is not
contingent on Buyers ability to obtain any financing, whether pursuant to
the Financing Commitments or otherwise, and Buyers failure to consummate the
Financing or alternative financing for the Required Amount upon the
satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions shall constitute a material
breach by Buyer of this Agreement.

_Section 5.6_ _Finders; Brokers_. None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
has employed any finder, broker or investment banker in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement who would have a valid claim for a
fee, commission or expenses from Seller in connection with the negotiation,
execution or delivery of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

 

 _Section 5.7_ _Solvency_. Assuming that the representations and warranties
in _Article 4_ are true and correct, that Seller and Buyer have each complied
with their respective obligations under this Agreement, the funding of the
Debt Financing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Debt
Financing Commitment on the Closing Date and that the most recent financial
forecasts made available to Buyer by Seller prior to the Agreement Date have
been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to
be reasonable and immediately prior to the Closing ( _provided_ that Seller
is making no representation and warranty with respect to such financial
forecasts), at and immediately after the Closing, and after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated hereunder (including any financings being
entered into in connection therewith), Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including
the Purchased Entities), taken as a whole, on a consolidated basis, will be
Solvent.

 

 _Section 5.8_ _Buyer Activity_. Buyer and its Subsidiaries, including all
Other Buyers, have been formed solely for the purpose of effecting the
Purchase Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents. Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries have any
liabilities or other obligations other than pursuant to the Transaction
Documents and the Financing Commitments except as would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

 



71 _Section 5.9_ _Investor Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, Buyer has delivered to Seller the Limited Guarantees. The
Limited Guarantee of Sponsor is in full force and effect and is a valid,
legal, binding and enforceable obligation of Sponsor, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be affected by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, and
general equitable principles. The Limited Guarantee of GIC is in full force
and effect and is a valid, legal, binding and enforceable obligation of GIC,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability
may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally, and general equitable principles. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of the Sponsor or GIC under its
respective Limited Guarantee. Nothing in this _Section 5.9_ shall be
construed to limit in any way Sellers right to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by _Section 11.7_.

 

 _Section 5.10_ _Securities Act_. Buyer and the Other Buyers are acquiring
the Purchased Shares solely for the purpose of investment and not with a view
to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer
acknowledges that the Purchased Shares are not registered under the Securities
Act, any applicable state securities Laws or any applicable
foreign securities Laws, and that such Purchased Shares may not be
transferred or sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of the
Securities Act or applicable foreign securities Laws or pursuant to an
applicable exemption therefrom and pursuant to applicable state securities
Laws. Buyer (either alone or together with its advisors) has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Purchased Shares
and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment.

_Section 5.11_ _Independent Investigation_. Buyer has conducted its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, software,
technology and prospects of the Business, which investigation, review and
analysis was done by Buyer and its Affiliates and representatives. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in _Article 4_ , Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that (a) in entering into this Agreement, it has
relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and analysis and
not on any factual representations or opinions of Seller or its
representatives and (b) none of Seller, any Other Seller, or any Subsidiaries
or Affiliates of Seller nor any other Person makes any other express, implied
or statutory representation or warranty (including in any information,
document, or material made available to Buyer or its counsel or other
representatives in Buyers due diligence review, including in "data rooms"
(electronic or otherwise) or management presentations) with respect to the
Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or otherwise,
including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, title, enforceability or noninfringement or any projections,
estimates and budgets for the Business. Buyer acknowledges that there are
assumptions inherent in making any such projections, estimates and budgets,
Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties and that Buyer is responsible for
making its own evaluation of the Business.

knowledgeable about the Business, the Purchased Shares, the Purchased Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities as Buyer may reasonably request, during regular
business hours to review information and documentation and ask questions
relative to the properties, books, Contracts and other records of the

Representatives of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, and which may be provided via email). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (a) provide

Seller or such Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or binding agreement of
Seller or such Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , that Seller shall inform Buyer as
to the general nature of what is being withheld as a result of the foregoing
and shall use its reasonable efforts to disclose such information in a way
that would not waive such privilege or contravene any applicable Law or
binding agreement), (b) provide access to or disclose any document,
communication or information related to the sale process with respect to the
Business or any other potential transaction relating to the sale or
divestiture of the Business, (c) provide access to personnel records of the

evaluation records, medical histories or other information that Seller

Buyer as to the general nature of what is being withheld as a result of the
foregoing and shall use its reasonable efforts to disclose such information in
a way that would not result in the sharing of sensitive information or
reasonably risk liability) or (d) provide access to any property of Seller or
its Subsidiaries for purposes of conducting any environmental sampling or
testing.

 

(b) The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and their respective terms and all information,

Affiliate of such other Party, in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or pursuant to this  _Section
6.2_ shall be treated as "Evaluation Material" of such Party under that
certain Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated February 23, 2015 between the
Parties (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, (i) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
execution of this Agreement shall constitute written consent by Seller
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement to all actions by the Buyer Related
Parties expressly permitted or expressly required by this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents that would otherwise be restricted under the
Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) any provision in the Confidentiality
Agreement providing that Seller need not provide any information or
Evaluation Material to Buyer or its Representatives (including Section 7

whose failure to comply with such obligations Seller will be responsible, (ii)

Affiliate thereof after the Closing Date on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than Buyer or an Affiliate or Representative thereof ( _provided_

establish by reasonable evidence is independently developed by Seller or any
Affiliate thereof following the Closing without reference to or reliance upon
Confidential Information of or relating to Buyer, the Purchased Assets, the
Purchased Shares, the Assumed Liabilities and/or the Business (including,
without limitation, information provided to Seller or an Affiliate or
Representative thereof following the Closing pursuant to this Agreement).

(d) From and after the Closing Date, except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, Buyer shall hold and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to hold, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives (and be responsible for any breach by
its Representatives) to hold, in strict confidence and not to disclose,
release or use (except as may be necessary to enforce its rights as described

under the Signing Date Agreements or preparation of any Tax Returns required
to be filed by it) without the prior written consent of Seller, any and all
Confidential Information related to the Excluded Assets, the Excluded
Liabilities and/or the businesses of Seller (other than the Business);

informed of their obligation to hold such information confidential to the same
extent as is applicable to Buyer and in respect of whose failure to comply

information pursuant to applicable Law or pursuant to the applicable rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange applicable to
listed companies, or (iii) in connection with the enforcement of any right or

disclosure of such confidential and proprietary information is made pursuant
to clause (ii) above, Buyer shall to the extent practicable and permissible
promptly notify Seller of the existence of such request or demand and shall
provide Seller a reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective
order or other remedy (and cooperate with Seller with respect thereto, at
Sellers sole cost and expense), and in the event such protective order or

proprietary information without Liability hereunder, but shall furnish only
that portion of such confidential and proprietary information that Buyer
is advised by legal counsel it is legally required to disclose and shall, to
the extent requested by Seller, exercise reasonable efforts, at Sellers sole
cost and expense, to preserve the confidentiality of such information.

 _Section 6.3_ _Necessary Efforts; No Inconsistent Action_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to applicable
Law, and other than to receive CFIUS Approval, DSS Approval or with respect
to Antitrust Laws, which are the subject of _Section 6.3(b)_ through _Section
6.3(h)_, Seller and Buyer agree, and Buyer and Seller agree to cause their
respective Subsidiaries and, in the case of Buyer, the Investors (other than
GIC) to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to each Partys
obligation to close the transactions contemplated hereby as set forth in
_Article 7_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) to obtain all
Consents, licenses, certificates, permits, approvals, clearances, expirations,
consents, waivers or terminations of applicable waiting periods,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of any Governmental Authority (each
a " _Governmental Consent_ ") or other Persons, including with respect to any
of the Assigned Material Contracts, required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
unless, in the case of a Consent of a Person other than a Governmental
Authority, Buyer requests that Seller not attempt to obtain such Consent (it
being understood that the failure to obtain any such Consents shall not, by
itself, cause the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_ to be deemed not to

 



81  be satisfied), (iii) to effect all such necessary registrations, novations,
notices, disclosures and filings with the Governmental Authorities in order to

transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) to comply with all requirements under

Liabilities of the type described in the definition of Excluded Liabilities)
and (b) transferring any employees that are not Business Employees, in each of
the foregoing cases (a) and (b), from the Purchased Entities to Seller or one
of its Subsidiaries (other than a Purchased Entities) such that the Purchased
Entities are transferred to Buyer at Closing without any such Excluded
Liabilities (or any Liabilities of the type described in the definition of
Excluded Liabilities) or employees that are not Business Employees, in each of
the foregoing cases to the greatest extent commercially practicable and
permitted by Law. The Parties shall cooperate fully with each other to the
extent necessary in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ , _that_ ,
except as expressly set forth in _Section 6.3(b) and (f)_, neither Buyer nor
Seller will be required to make any payments (other than filing fees), incur
any Liability, or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to
any third party in connection with obtaining any Consent of any Person.
Further, in no event will Seller, and Seller will cause its Subsidiaries not
to, without Buyers prior written consent, commit to any divestiture
transaction, or commit to alter their businesses or commercial practices in
any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any such action that, in
each case, would reasonably be expected to limit Buyers freedom of action
with respect to, or Buyers ability to retain any of the businesses, product
lines or assets of, the Business or otherwise receive the full benefits of
this Agreement, including, in each case, in connection with the Operational
Separation Activities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except
as expressly set forth in _Section 6.3(b) or (f)_, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not be required to commit to any divestiture transaction, or commit to
alter their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or otherwise take
or commit to take any action that limits Buyers freedom of action with
respect to, or Buyers ability to retain any of the businesses, product lines
or assets of, the Business or otherwise receive the full benefits of this
Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.3(a)_ with respect to the
undertakings pursuant thereto, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts (and, in the case of Buyer, shall cause the
Investors to use their respective reasonable best efforts) to take all
actions necessary to (i) obtain any Governmental Consents required for the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 7.3(f)(i)_ as promptly as
possible, including as promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date
initiating informal consultations with CFIUS with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and then, if deemed necessary to
obtain CFIUS Approval by either one or both of the Parties following such
informal consultations, as promptly as practicable, at the request of either
Party, and in no event later than 20 Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, making a preliminary joint voluntary notice in accordance with
Exon-Florio (the " _Exon-Florio Filing_ ") to CFIUS with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereafter making any
other required submissions and filings, and responding as promptly as
practicable to any requests for additional information or documentary material
with respect to, such filing and otherwise in connection with obtaining the
CFIUS Approval and (ii) obtain any Governmental Consents required for
the satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 7.3(f)(ii)_ as
promptly as possible after the Agreement Date, including (A) submitting to the
Defense Security Service of the United States Department of Defense (" _DSS_
") (and, to the extent applicable, any other Governmental Authority)
notification of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, a foreign
ownership, control or influence (" _FOCI_ ") action plan, and any other
submission or communication required to be provided under NISPOM and any other
applicable national or industrial security regulations, and (B) facilitating
acceptance of a Commitment Letter with DSS setting out the FOCI mitigation
requirements required by DSS in connection with the transactions

 



82  contemplated by this Agreement and to otherwise ensure compliance with
NISPOM (acceptance of such Commitment Letter or the determination by DSS that
FOCI mitigation is not required, the " _DSS Approval_ "). Each Party shall
(and, in the case of Buyer, shall cause the Investors to) furnish such
necessary information and assistance as the other Party may reasonably request
in connection with the preparation of any necessary filings or submissions by
it to CFIUS, DSS or other Governmental Authority involved in the Exon-Florio
review or DSS Approval process, including, but not limited to, all information
and materials required by CFIUS under 31 C.F.R. 800.402, issuing, or
arranging for the issuance of, any sponsor letter, DD-254, or other
documentation required to commence the process to obtain DSS Approval as
promptly as practicable and in no event later than 20 Business Days following
the date of this Agreement, and providing copies of the written internal
security procedures of Seller reasonably transferable to the Business to be
operated by Buyer and supportive of the Commitment Letter sought from DSS.
Seller and Buyer shall (and, in the case of Buyer, shall cause the Investors
to) use their reasonable best efforts to (x) avoid possible rejection or
deferred acceptance of the Exon-Florio Filing, (y) respond as promptly as
practicable and within any time limitations imposed by applicable regulations
to any inquiries from CFIUS, DSS or any other Governmental Authority involved
in the Exon-Florio review or DSS Approval process and make any other
submissions that are required to be made or that the Parties agree should
be made and (z) obtain the CFIUS Approval and the DSS Approval as promptly as
practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date.

 

For purposes of this Section 6.3(b) only, the term "reasonable best efforts"
shall be interpreted in light of past CFIUS reviews and investigations and
DSS proceedings relating to the Investors, including, to the extent FOCI
mitigation is required, entering into a Security Control Agreement (SCA) with
the DSS that is not materially more burdensome with respect to any given
Investor than other SCAs entered into by that Investor; _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing in this Agreement will require, or be deemed to require, Buyer,
the Investors or their respective Affiliates to take any action that
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in
a Burdensome Condition. In the event Buyer determines that a Burdensome
Condition may be required in order to obtain CFIUS Approval or DSS Approval,
Buyer shall have the right (effective upon written notice to Seller) to
require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to retain one or more of the
Classified Government Contracts or any portion thereof and all or a portion of
the Business Employees listed on _Schedule 6.3(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter
(the Business Employee who are retained pursuant to this _Section 6.3(b)_ are
referred to herein as the " _Cleared Employees_ "). In the event DSS Approval
has not been obtained on or before the 23rd day after the acceptance by CFIUS
of the filing required to obtain CFIUS Approval, Seller shall have the right
(effective upon written notice to Buyer) to retain in its reasonable judgment
(after consultation with Buyer) the minimum number of Classified Government
Contracts and the minimum number of Cleared Employees that would allow for the
elimination of the need for DSS Approval. Following the delivery of such
notice or such election by either Buyer or Seller (the " _Classified
Government Contracts Retention Election_ "), the condition set forth in
Section 7.3(f)(ii) shall be deemed to have been satisfied. Following such
Classified Government Contracts Retention Election, (i) the Classified
Government Contracts so retained shall be deemed to be "Retained Contracts"
subject to the terms of the Retained Contracts Agreement until Buyer notifies
Seller following the Closing to transfer such Contracts to Buyer or one of
its Subsidiaries (at which time Seller will transfer such Contracts to Buyer
or the applicable Subsidiary), (ii) the Cleared Employees so retained shall
remain employees of Seller (and shall not be deemed a Business Employee for
any purpose of this Agreement other than _Section 6.1(a)_) until such time as
Buyer (or one of its Subsidiaries) makes a Compliant Offer to such Cleared
Employee (it being understood that if Buyer elects to have such Contracts so
transferred, it must make a Compliant Offer to each such Cleared Employee) and
(iii) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required
approvals of such Governmental Authorities as may be necessary to transfer
such Classified Government Contracts and Cleared Employees to Buyer, in each
case as promptly as practicable. To the extent a Cleared Employee accepts such
offer and begins employment with Buyer (or such Subsidiary) the
Cleared Employee shall, from and after such time, be deemed a Continuing
Employee for purposes of this Agreement. Following the Closing until such

 



83  Compliant Offer is made by Buyer (and for thirty days after), Buyer shall be
responsible for, pay and discharge, shall reimburse Seller for (x) 142% of
base salary and (y) all Termination Amounts, in each case of the Cleared
Employees that accrue from and after the Closing. Except as expressly provided
in this _Section 6.3(b)_, in no event shall Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
be required or expected to take any action to retain any of the Purchased
Assets or Purchased Shares (including assets that would be Purchased Assets or
shares that would have been Purchased Shares, but for the inability to obtain
CFIUS Approval or DSS Approval) or be required to grant rights of any kind to
any third party or pay any amount, grant any guarantee or provide any other
consideration to any third party in order to obtain CFIUS Approval or DSS
Approval.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.3(a)_ with respect to the
undertakings pursuant thereto, Buyer and Seller shall (or, in the case of
Buyer, shall cause the Person(s) controlling Buyer to) promptly make all
filings which may be required for the satisfaction of the condition set forth
in _Section 7.1(b)_ by each of them in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, which, in any event, shall be made
within (i) 10 Business Days following the Agreement Date with respect to the
initial filings required under the HSR Act and (ii) as promptly
as practicable following the Agreement Date with respect to the initial
filings required by all other applicable Antitrust Laws (but in any event
within 30 Business Days after the Agreement Date, to the extent reasonably
practicable). In addition, Buyer and Seller agree, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries, and, subject in all respects to _Section
6.3(f)_ and _Section 6.3(g)_, in the case of Buyer, cause the Sponsor or
other controlling Person(s), to cooperate and to use their respective
reasonable best efforts and take all actions necessary to obtain any
Governmental Consents required for the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth (x) in _Section 7.1(a)_ with respect to Antitrust Laws in the
countries set forth on _Schedule 7.1(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter and (y)
_Section 7.1(b)_ as promptly as possible, including to respond as promptly as
practicable to any requests for information from any such Governmental
Authority, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an " _Antitrust Order_ ") that
restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Purchase Transaction
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust
Law. Each Party shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of any necessary filings or submissions by it to any such
Governmental Authority. Neither Party shall consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or withdraw its notification and report
form pursuant to the HSR Act or any other filing made pursuant to any
Antitrust Law with respect to the Purchase Transaction or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement unless the other Party has
given its prior written consent to such extension or delay (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) Buyer and Seller will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to
the other in advance (to the extent legally permissible), any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto in connection with Proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Laws or to receive CFIUS Approval or DSS
Approval in connection with this Agreement (other than, in the case of Buyer
or Seller, as the case may be, the portions of such correspondence, filings
and written communications that include confidential or proprietary
information not directly related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection
with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, the Parties agree, except as prohibited or
restricted by applicable Law, to (i) give each other reasonable advance notice
of all meetings with any Governmental Authority relating to any
Antitrust Laws or in connection with efforts to obtain CFIUS Approval or DSS
Approval, (ii) give each other an opportunity to participate in each of such
meetings, (iii) give each other reasonable advance notice of all substantive
oral communications with any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust
Laws or the

 



84  CFIUS Approval or DSS Approval, (iv) if any Governmental Authority initiates
a substantive oral communication regarding any Antitrust Laws or in connection
with efforts to obtain CFIUS Approval or DSS Approval, to promptly notify the
other Party of the substance of such communication, (v) provide each other
with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon all written
communications, including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals (other than, in the case of Buyer or Seller,
as the case may be, the portions of such presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals that include confidential or proprietary
information not directly related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), with a Governmental Authority regarding any Antitrust Laws or in
connection with efforts to obtain CFIUS Approval or DSS Approval, and (vi)
provide each other with copies of all written communications from any
Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws or efforts to obtain
CFIUS Approval or DSS Approval. Any disclosures or provision of copies by one
Party to the other may be made on an outside counsel basis, if appropriate.
During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (x) the
date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and (y) the
Closing, except as prohibited or restricted by applicable Law, each Party or
its attorneys shall provide the other Party or its attorneys the opportunity
to make copies of all correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between such Party or its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (other than, in the case of Buyer
or Seller, as the case may be, the portions of such correspondence, filings
and communications that include confidential or proprietary information not
directly related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Buyer
shall have the responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for
obtaining the CFIUS Approval and the DSS Approval and shall take the lead in
all meetings and communications with CFIUS and DSS, as applicable, relating to
the Purchase Transaction or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case, in a manner consistent with its obligations
hereunder, and at all times in consultation and cooperation with Seller as set
forth herein.

 

(e) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (x)
the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and (y)
the Closing, except as prohibited or restricted by applicable Law, each of
Buyer and Seller shall notify and keep the other reasonably advised as to (i)
any material communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) any litigation or
administrative Proceeding pending and known to such Party, or to its knowledge
threatened, which challenges, or would challenge, the transactions
contemplated hereby. During the period from the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of (x) the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms and (y) the Closing, subject to the provisions of _Article 10_
hereof or except as otherwise expressly permitted or contemplated by this
Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall not knowingly take any action inconsistent
with their obligations under this Agreement or, without prejudice to Sellers
or Buyers rights under this Agreement, that would reasonably be expected to
materially hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

 

(f) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted or
threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any
of the transactions contemplated hereby as violating any Antitrust Law or if a
filing pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)_ is reasonably likely to be rejected
or conditioned by a Governmental Authority, then each of the Parties shall
use reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections or challenges as such
Governmental Authority or private party may have to such transactions so as to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
soon as practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall and subject to subclause
(ii) of the last sentence of this clause (f), shall cause the Investors to
promptly pursue all actions necessary to eliminate any concerns on the part
of, or to satisfy any conditions imposed

 



85  by, any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the enforcement of any
Antitrust Law regarding the Purchase Transaction, including (i) proposing,
negotiating, offering to commit and effecting (and if such offer is accepted,
committing to and effecting), by consent decree, proxy arrangement, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such
assets or businesses of Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased
Entities), now owned or hereafter sought to be acquired, or of the Purchased
Shares or the Purchased Assets, (ii) terminating or amending any existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations of Buyer or
its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased Entities), or (iii) otherwise
offering to take or offering to commit to take any action on its or its
Subsidiaries behalf which it is capable of taking, and if the offer is
accepted, taking or committing to take, such actions as are necessary,
whether or not such actions limit or modify Buyers rights of ownership in, or
ability to conduct the business of, one or more of its operations, divisions,
businesses, product lines, customers or assets, including, after the Closing,
the Business, in each case, if it is determined that such action is necessary
in order to obtain all Governmental Consents necessary to satisfy the
condition set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ with respect to Antitrust Laws in
the countries set forth on _Schedule 7.1(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter and
_Section 7.1(b)_ prior to the Outside Date and/or to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any Antitrust Order which would have the effect
of preventing or delaying the consummation of the Purchase Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated hereby beyond the Outside Date. In connection
therewith, Buyer shall take any and all actions with respect to it and
its Subsidiaries necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for a
waiver, consent or approval of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or
Proceeding under any Antitrust Law, and (z) no other matter relating to any
Antitrust Law, would preclude consummation of the Purchase Transaction prior
to the Outside Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer shall keep Seller
reasonably informed of all material matters, discussions and activities
relating to any of the matters contemplated by this  _Section 6.3(f)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, (i) in no event
shall Seller or any of its Subsidiaries be required or expected to take any
action to retain any of the Purchased Assets or Purchased Shares (including
assets that would be Purchased Assets or shares that would be Purchased Shares
but for the inability to obtain a Governmental Consent) or be required to
grant rights of any kind to any third party or pay any amount, grant any
guarantee or provide any other consideration to any third party in order to
obtain any Governmental Consent under an Antitrust Law and (ii) in no event
shall any Investor or any of its Affiliates (other than Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (which, for purposes hereof, will include the Purchased
Entities)) be required to sell, divest, hold separate, license, cause a third-
party to acquire, or otherwise dispose of any Affiliate of any Investor (other
than Buyer and its Subsidiaries (which, for purposes hereof, will include the
Purchased Entities)), operations, divisions, businesses, product lines,
customers or assets of any Investor or any Affiliate of any Investor (other
than Buyer and its Subsidiaries (which, for purposes hereof, will include the
Purchased Entities)), terminate any Contract or other business relationship of
any Investor or any Affiliate of any Investor (other than those of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries (which, for purposes hereof, will include the Purchased
Entities)), alter any business conduct of any Investor or any Affiliate of
any Investor (other than with respect to Buyer and its Subsidiaries (which,
for purposes hereof, will include the Purchased Entities)), or be required to
grant rights of any kind to any third party or pay any amount, grant any
guarantee or provide any other consideration to any third party or incur
additional costs or expenses in order to obtain any Governmental Consent, nor
shall anything herein be deemed to require Buyer to cause any Investor or any
other Affiliate thereof (other than Subsidiaries of Buyer (which, for purposes
hereof, will include the Purchased Entities)) to do any of the foregoing.

 

(g) During the period from the Agreement Date until the earlier of (x) the
date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and (y) the
Closing, subject to the provisions of _Article 10_ hereof or except as
otherwise expressly permitted or contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall
not and Buyer shall cause Sponsor not to, without the prior written consent
of Seller, knowingly

 



86  engage in any action or enter into any transaction or permit any action to
be taken or transaction to be entered into by Buyer, Sponsor or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that would reasonably be expected to have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
none of Buyer, Sponsor or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall, and
shall not cause any Person to, acquire (whether via merger, consolidation,
stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any assets of
or any equity in any other Person or any business or division thereof, if that
acquisition or agreement would reasonably be expected to (i)
materially increase the risk of not obtaining any Governmental Consent
required by Section 6.3(b) and Section 6.3(c), (ii) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise, in each case, under any Law contemplated by Section
6.3(b) and Section 6.3(c) or (iii) prevent or materially delay receipt of any
Governmental Consent required by Section 6.3(b) and Section 6.3(c).

 

 _Section 6.4_ _Public Disclosures_. Upon the request of either Buyer or
Seller, upon the execution of this Agreement and upon the Closing, Buyer or
Seller shall each release a press release mutually acceptable to Buyer and
Seller. From and after the Agreement Date, neither Buyer nor Seller shall, and
Buyer and Seller shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries and its
and their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, and
representatives (including financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys
and accountants) not to, directly or indirectly, issue any press release or
other public statement relating to the terms of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby that discloses any additional information
regarding the same or that is otherwise inconsistent with the agreed press
releases, or uses the name of the other Party or its Affiliates or refers to
the other Party or its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, in connection with
the relationship under this Agreement of the Parties and their Affiliates in
any media interview, advertisement, news release, press release
or professional or trade publication, or in any print media, whether or not
in response to an inquiry, without the prior written approval of the other
Party, except that (a) Buyer or Seller may issue such release or statement or
make such other disclosures as they may reasonably determine is necessary to
comply with applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange ( _provided_ that to the extent in the good faith judgment
of such Party it is reasonably practicable to do so, such Party shall provide
the other Party with a reasonable opportunity in light of the circumstances to
review such Partys intended communication (to the extent made in writing) and
consider in good faith modifications to the intended communication reasonably
requested by the other Party), (b) the Parties may issue any press release or
make other public announcement (including to analysts or investors) to the
extent that such release or announcement only contains information previously
publicly disclosed in accordance with this _Section 6.4_ or is otherwise
consistent in all material respects with previous statements made jointly by
Buyer and Seller or with the permission of the other Party; (c) Seller may
disclose any information concerning the transactions contemplated hereby which
it deems appropriate in its reasonable judgment, in light of its status as a
publicly owned company, including to securities analysts and institutional
investors and in press interviews ( _provided_ that to the extent in the good
faith judgment of Seller it is reasonably practicable to do so, Seller shall
provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity in light of the circumstances
to review Sellers intended communication (to the extent made in writing) and
consider in good faith modifications to the intended communication reasonably
requested by Buyer); (d) the Investors, the funds affiliated with the
Investors and their management companies may make disclosures to their
current, former or prospective investors, equity holders and limited partners
to the extent such information is customarily provided to current, former or
prospective investors, equity holders or limited partners in private equity
funds (provided the recipients of such information are subject to a non-
disclosure agreement to maintain the confidentiality of such information), (e)
Buyer and its Affiliates may make customary disclosures as expressly
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (including in connection with
the syndication of the Debt Financing), subject to the confidentiality
undertakings set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment (and Buyer will be
responsible for breaches of the obligations under by such recipients)
(provided the recipients of such disclosed information are subject to a non-
disclosure agreement to

 



87  maintain the confidentiality of such information) and (f) Buyer and its
Affiliates may make customary disclosures to the Investors and other potential
investors in Buyer (provided the recipients of such disclosed information are
subject to a non-disclosure agreement to maintain the confidentiality of such
information). Without limiting the foregoing provisions hereof, Seller shall,
to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with Buyer regarding the form
and content of any public disclosure of any material developments or matters
involving the Business (including the financial condition or results of
operations), Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the Purchased Entities,
including earnings releases, reasonably in advance of publication or release.

_Section 6.5_ _Post-Closing Access to Records and Personnel_.

(a) _Exchange of Information_. Subject to the further requirements set forth
in S _ection 6.8(f)(iv)_ with respect to Taxes, after the Closing, for a
period of seven years after the Closing Date, upon receipt of reasonable prior
notice, each Party agrees to provide, or cause to be provided, to each other,
as soon as reasonably practicable after written request therefor and at the
requesting Partys sole expense (but only for the reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Party in providing such access), reasonable
access during normal business hours, and in manner so as not to unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of such other Partys business, to the other
Partys employees (without substantial disruption of employment) and to any
books, records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings,
evidences of title and other papers relating to the conduct of the Business on
or before the Closing Date and (x) in the case of Seller, the Excluded Assets
and Excluded Liabilities and (y) in the case of Buyer, the Purchased Assets,
the Purchased Shares and the Assumed Liabilities (the " _Books and Records_
"), to the extent reasonably available and in the possession or under the
control of the other Party that the requesting Party reasonably needs (i) to
comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on the
requesting Party (including under applicable securities Laws) by a
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the requesting Party, (ii)
for use in any other judicial, regulatory, administrative or other Proceeding,
or in order to satisfy Tax, audit, accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation
or other similar requirements, (iii) in connection with the filing of any Tax
return or election or any amended return or claim for refund, determining a
liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or any Tax audit or other
Proceeding in respect of Taxes, (iv) to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, or (v) in connection with
any other matter requiring access to any such employees, books, records,
documents, files and correspondence of the other Party, solely to the extent
necessary for Buyers operation of the Business after Closing or Sellers
operation of its businesses after Closing, as the case may be; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Party shall be required to provide access to or disclose
information where such access or disclosure would be reasonably expected to
violate any Law or agreement, or waive any attorney-client or other similar
privilege ( _provided_ , in the event such provision of information would
reasonably be expected to violate any Law or agreement or waive any attorney-
client or other similar privilege, the Party with such information shall
inform the other as to the general nature of what is being withheld as a
result of the foregoing and shall take all reasonable measures to permit the
disclosure in a manner that avoids any such violation or waiver, including in
accordance with _Section 6.12_), and each Party may redact information
regarding itself or its Subsidiaries not relating to Business, the Purchased
Assets, the Purchased Shares and the Assumed Liabilities.

(b) _Ownership of Information_. Any information owned by a Party that is
provided to a requesting Party pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall be deemed
to remain the property of the providing Party. Unless specifically set forth
herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or
conferring rights of license or otherwise in any such information.

(c) _Record Retention_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to retain the Books and
Records in its possession or control for a

 



88  reasonable period of time as set forth in its regular document retention
policy, as such policy may be amended from time to time, or for such longer
period as may be required by Law, or until the expiration of the relevant
representation or warranty under any of the Transaction Documents and any
related claim of indemnification related thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Party may destroy or otherwise dispose of any Books and
Records not in accordance with its retention policy (or otherwise not in
compliance with the foregoing); _provided_ that prior to such destruction or
disposal (i) such Party shall provide no less than 75 Business Day prior
written notice to the other Party of any such proposed destruction or
disposal (which notice shall specify in reasonable detail which of the Books
and Records is proposed to be so destroyed or disposed of and the general type
and scope of information contained therein), and (ii) if a recipient of such
notice shall request in writing prior to the scheduled date for such
destruction or disposal that any of the information proposed to be destroyed
or disposed of be delivered to such recipient, such Party proposing the
destruction or disposal shall, as promptly as practicable, arrange for the
delivery of such of the Books and Records as was requested by the recipient
(it being understood that all reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated with
the delivery of the requested Books and Records shall be paid by such
recipient, except in the case the requesting Party is Buyer and such Books and
Records constitute Purchased Assets).

 

(d) _Limitation of Liability_. No Party shall have any Liability to any other
Party in the event that any information exchanged or provided pursuant to
this _Section 6.5_ is found to be inaccurate. No Party shall have any
Liability to any other Party if any information is destroyed or lost after
commercially reasonable efforts by such Party to comply with the provisions
of _Section 6.5(c)_.

(e) _Other Agreements Providing for Exchange of Information_. The rights and
obligations granted under this _Section 6.5_ are subject to any specific
limitations, qualifications or additional provisions on the sharing, exchange
or confidential treatment of information set forth in this Agreement.

 

(f) _Confidential Information_. Nothing in this _Section 6.5_ shall require
(i) either Party to violate any agreement with any third parties regarding
the confidentiality of confidential and proprietary information; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that either Party is required under this
_Section 6.5_ to disclose any such information, that Party shall inform the
other as to the general nature of what is being withheld as a result of the
foregoing and shall use all reasonable efforts to seek to obtain such third
partys Consent to the disclosure of such information and implement requisite
procedures to enable the disclosure of such information or take all reasonable
measures to permit the disclosure in a manner that avoids any such violation,
(ii) Seller to provide or cause to be provided to Buyer any
information related to the sale process of the Business or any other
potential transaction relating to the sale, spin-off or divestiture of the
Business or Sellers or its representatives evaluation thereof, including
projections, financial or other information related thereto or (iii) either
Party to disclose any information if Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse
parties in a litigation (including any such litigation relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby), to the extent
the information is related thereto (or the subject matter thereof) or
requested in connection therewith (provided that such restriction shall not
apply to any information to the extent necessary for such Party to prepare any
Tax Returns or any filings required by the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange). The covenants contained herein shall in no
event be considered a waiver of any attorney-client privilege, work product
privilege or any similar privilege.

_Section 6.6_  _Employee Relations and Benefits_.

(a) Seller shall from time to time provide to Buyer (and at least 10 Business
Days prior to Closing), to the extent permitted by applicable Law, an updated
Employee Census, that includes

 



89  the names of the Business Employees, as well as each such Business
Employees jurisdiction of employment; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall update (and provide to Buyer) the Employee Census from time to time
until the Closing (or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the
Delayed Transfer Closing) in order to maintain the accuracy of the Employee
Census, including as a result of employee terminations, transfers (within
Seller or its Subsidiaries), new hires, and inadvertent errors or omissions
not to exceed a __de minimis__ amount, transfers of Business Employees to
Purchased Entities, and changes in salary or wage rate, target bonus
or material benefit plan participation, in each case, subject to Sellers
obligations under this Agreement.

(b) Where applicable, the Parties intend that there shall be continuity of
employment with respect to all Business Employees and that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement do not constitute a separation, termination or
severance of employment of any Continuing Employee (or any Business Employee)
prior to or upon the occurrence of the Closing (or, with respect to any
Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing). Prior to
Operational Separation (or such time as may be required by applicable Law or
_Section 6.6(c)_), the Seller shall cause the appropriate Employing Entity to
make an offer of employment (except in Thailand, where Buyer shall cause its
appropriate Affiliate to make an offer of employment prior to the
Closing Date (or to the extent it is a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the
Delayed Transfer Closing)), or provide notice of such Business Employees
change in employer, to each of the Business Employees in such jurisdiction,
other than (i) Automatic Transferred Employees and (ii) Business Employees
already then employed by a Purchased Entity, in compliance with the terms of
_Section 6.6(c)_. Each such Business Employee who accepts (and commences)
employment with an Employing Entity pursuant to such offer of employment or
notice of change in employment status and continues to be employed by such
Employing Entity at the Closing (or, with respect to a Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing) and each Purchased Entity
Employee, is referred to herein as a " _Continuing Employee_." Each Continuing
Employee who is based in the United States is referred to as a " _U.S.
Continuing Employee_ ," and each Continuing Employee who is based outside of
the United States is referred to as a " _Foreign Continuing Employee_." Each
appropriate Purchased Entity as described on _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the
Disclosure Letter that, on or following the Operational Separation, employs a
Continuing Employee is referred to herein as an " _Employing Entity_ _._ "
Each Business Employee who receives an offer of employment or notice of change
in employment status from an Employing Entity that complies with this
_Section 6.6_ (a " _Compliant Offer_ "), excluding (i) each Automatic
Transferred Employee and (ii) each Business Employee who would have otherwise
been an Automatic Transferred Employee but who objects to the automatic
transfer of his or her employment to Purchased Entities by operation of Law,
is referred to herein as an " _Offer Recipient Employee_." Nothing herein will
be construed as a representation or guarantee by Seller or any of its
Affiliates that (A) some or all of the Business Employees will accept an offer
of employment with a Purchased Entity or acquiesce to the automatic transfer
of their employment by operation of Law to a Purchased Entity, as applicable,
or (B) some or all of the Continuing Employees will continue in employment
with an Employing Entity or any of its Affiliates for any period of time
following the Closing. Seller shall not discourage and shall, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to encourage, each Business Employee to accept
offers of employment from an Employing Entity, and otherwise transfer to or
continue employment with an Employing Entity or its Affiliates (including, as
of the Closing (or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the
Delayed Transfer Closing), Buyer and its Subsidiaries). Seller will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries to, not knowingly make any commitment to any Business
Employee about continuing the employment of such Person with Seller or its
Affiliates following the Closing or knowingly discourage such Person from
accepting such offers with an Employing Entity or otherwise transferring or
continuing employment with Buyer and its Affiliates; _provided_ , _that_ ,
nothing herein shall be interpreted as requiring Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to provide any Business Employee with any additional compensation
or benefits to incent such Person to accept such offer of employment by an
Employing Entity and its Subsidiaries.

 



90 (c) Buyer may request to review the form of offer of employment and/or form of
notice of change in employment status to be presented to the Offer Recipient
Employees, and Seller will reasonably cooperate with such request; _provided
that_ such request would not reasonably be expected to detrimentally impact
the Sellers ability to timely complete the Operational Separation
Activities. Pursuant to this _Section 6.6_, Seller shall cause the Employing
Entity to present its terms and conditions of employment (including terms and
conditions in respect of post-Closing compensation and benefits and potential
Post-Transaction Severance Benefits) to the Offer Recipient Employees (except
in Thailand, where Buyer shall cause the Employing Entity to present its terms
and conditions of employment), which terms and conditions will be consistent
with the provisions of this _Section 6.6_. Seller shall cause the Employing
Entity to provide to each Offer Recipient Employee a written offer of
employment or notice of change in employer upon the employment terms and
conditions described herein, with such offer to be effective on or prior to
Operational Separation for such jurisdiction, such that, as of Operational
Separation for such jurisdiction, all Business Employees in such jurisdiction
are employed by the applicable Employing Entity in such jurisdiction. Seller
agrees that the offers made pursuant to _Section 6.6(b)_ will provide for
employment, and that it shall cause the Employing Entity to provide for
employment, at the same general location in accordance with applicable Law at
which such Continuing Employee was employed immediately prior to Operational
Separation, such that the Continuing Employee, except to the extent that such
greater benefits would not individually or in the aggregate be material to
the Business, (A) will be paid the same base rate of pay or hourly wage rate
as was paid to such Continuing Employee by Seller or its Affiliates
immediately prior to Operational Separation for such jurisdiction, (B) will
have target annual incentive compensation opportunities to the same extent as
was provided to such Continuing Employee from Seller or its Affiliates
immediately prior to Operational Separation for such jurisdiction, and (C)
will receive other compensation benefits and employment benefits (including
individual perquisites such as a company car or other automobile benefits;
retirement and savings benefits; health, vision and dental insurance; life
and ADandD insurance; disability insurance; vacation, PTO, sick, holiday,
maternity, paternity and other leave; relocation benefits; employee referral,
tuition and adoption assistance benefits; meal vouchers or allowance; gym
reimbursement; severance and qualified termination benefits) that, in the
aggregate, provide substantially comparable (and not materially more favorable
in the aggregate) terms, scope, coverage, quality and value as was provided to
such Continuing Employees immediately prior to Operational Separation in such
jurisdiction, or as required by any Contract in effect on the Agreement Date
or any applicable local Laws or Transfer Regulations (including, in each such
case, more favorable terms to the employee as are required by local Laws
including any applicable Transfer Regulations, in which case the terms of such
offer of employment or continued employment shall comply with such local
Laws). Buyer shall cause the Employing Entity in Thailand to provide to each
Offer Recipient Employee in Thailand a written offer of employment upon the
employment terms and conditions described herein (including the following
sentence), with such offer to be effective on or prior to the Closing
(including, as applicable, the Delayed Transfer Closing) for such
jurisdiction. Buyer agrees that it shall, or shall cause the applicable
Employing Entity, to maintain each Continuing Employees (including Continuing
Employees in Thailand), employment terms during the 12-month period that
begins as of the Closing (or (x) such shorter period as such Continuing
Employee remains an employee of such Employing Entity following the Closing,
or (y) such longer period as required by any applicable local Laws or
Transfer Regulations) (the " _Continuation Period_ "), including employment at
the same general location in accordance with applicable Law at which such
Continuing Employee was employed immediately prior to the Closing Date or
with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer
Closing (or such other location that would not give rise to any severance or
termination benefits), such that the Continuing Employee (A) will be paid
the same, or a superior, base rate of pay or hourly wage rate as was paid to
such Continuing Employee by the Employing Entity or its Affiliates immediately
prior to the Closing Date or with respect to any Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing, (B) will have target annual
incentive compensation opportunities to the same, or superior, extent as was
provided to such Continuing Employee from the Employing Entity or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date or with respect to any
Delayed

 



91  Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing, and (C) will receive
other compensation benefits and employment benefits (including individual
perquisites such as a company car or other automobile benefits; retirement
and savings benefits; health, vision and dental insurance; life and ADandD
insurance; disability insurance; vacation, PTO, sick, holiday, maternity,
paternity and other leave; relocation benefits; employee referral, tuition
and adoption assistance benefits; meal vouchers or allowance; gym
reimbursement; severance and qualified termination benefits) that, in the
aggregate, provide substantially comparable terms, scope, coverage, quality
and value as was provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date or with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the
Delayed Transfer Closing, or as required by any Contract in effect on the
Agreement Date or any applicable local Laws or Transfer Regulations
(including, in each such case, more favorable terms to the employee as are
required by local Laws including any applicable Transfer Regulations, in which
case the terms of such offer of employment or continued employment
shall comply with such local Laws), but, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, specifically excluding (1) deferred compensation
arrangements, liquidity, sale bonus, transaction, retention, change of control
bonus plans or similar arrangements and (2) equity, restricted stock units,
performance stock units, stock options or any other equity-based compensation
or awards. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyers obligation to maintain
compensation, benefits or employment arrangements hereunder shall be limited
to the continuation of such arrangements of a Purchased Entity as in effect
with respect to the Continuing Employees at Closing or, with respect to any
Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing (and after giving
effect to Operational Separation as performed by Seller) and Buyer shall not
have any obligation to maintain compensation, benefits or employment
arrangements to the extent Seller has not established New Benefit Plans
with a Purchased Entity providing such compensation, benefits or employment
arrangements to Continuing Employees as part of Operational Separation. Except
for the termination of employment or a change in status otherwise agreed to by
an employee (e.g., changes from full-time status to part-time status, changes
from expatriate status, etc.), Buyer agrees not to modify the terms of
employment described in the preceding sentences or terminate any benefits
offered to any Continuing Employee as provided in the preceding sentences in
a manner inconsistent with the preceding sentences, except as may be required
by applicable Law, during the Continuation Period without the prior written
consent of such Continuing Employee. Between the Agreement Date and the
Closing Date, any communications between Buyer and its Affiliates and any
Business Employees regarding the terms of employment, employee benefits or
otherwise regarding employment with Buyer and its Affiliates following
the Closing will be conducted at the times and through the processes mutually
agreed upon by Seller and Buyer and in accordance with applicable Law.

 

(d) Within ninety days following the Closing, and in accordance with
applicable Law, Buyer will adopt, make available and maintain a long-
term incentive compensation program for Continuing Employees, which program
structure shall include terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Continuing Employees than as set forth in the term sheet previously provided
by Buyer to Seller (the " _Buyer Long Term Incentive Program_ "). At Closing
(or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer
Closing), and subject to requirements under applicable Law, Buyer will
substitute all RSUs set forth on _Schedule 4.4(c)_ of the Disclosure Letter
and other RSUs granted after the Agreement Date in accordance with _Section
6.1(a)(xvii)_ (in each case, other than Retention RSUs or performance-based
RSUs) of Continuing Employees that are unvested as of the Closing Date (or,
with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer
Closing) ((i) after giving effect to any vesting that occurs as a result of
the Closing (including any Delayed Transfer Closing) and (ii) excluding from
such RSUs all Deemed Vested Awards) (the " _Unvested RSUs_") with the right
to receive an award (each a " _Substitute Unvested Award_ ") under the Buyer
Long Term Incentive Program with an aggregate economic value (determined
assuming achievement of Management Case EBITDA and vesting of the award under
the methodology described in the Buyer Long Term Incentive Program) to replace
the aggregate dollar value of the applicable Unvested RSUs (calculated for
each Unvested RSU award as the product of (x) the average closing price of the
common stock of Seller on the NASDAQ for the 20-trading

 



92  day period ending on the Closing Date (or, with respect to any Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing), multiplied by (y) the
number of unvested shares subject to such award), with vesting terms as
outlined on, and otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of, the Buyer
Long Term Incentive Program. The Substitute Unvested Award may, for the
avoidance of doubt (in the sole discretion of Buyer), be granted in the form
of stock options. Such Substitute Unvested Awards must be granted within
ninety days of the Closing Date (or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing). Upon the Closing (or, with
respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing),
(x) all Unvested RSUs and any other RSUs held by Continuing Employees (other
than as described in clause (y) below) that are outstanding and unvested as of
the Closing Date (or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the
Delayed Transfer Closing), in each case after giving effect to any vesting
that occurs as a result of the Closing, including the Delayed Transfer
Closing, shall be terminated and (y) the portion of an RSU that constitutes
Deemed Vested Awards shall be accelerated and become fully vested (and all
vesting criteria thereof shall be deemed achieved without any further action)
and, within thirty (30) days of the Closing (or, with respect to any Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing) Seller shall settle such
awards in full with common stock of Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Substitute Unvested Awards shall be issued with respect to the performance-
based RSUs, the RSUs of Continuing Employees set forth on _Schedule
6.6(d)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Letter (the " _Retention RSUs_ ") or any portion
of an RSU that constitutes a Deemed Vested Award. Except as expressly set
forth in this _Section 6.6(d)_, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any obligation or Liability with respect to any equity compensation
grants or equity awards issued to, or held by, any Continuing
Employee, Business Employee or other employee of Seller or its Affiliates.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will Buyer be required to issue any
Substitute Unvested Awards that constitute an incentive stock option (i.e.,
options qualified under Section 422 of Code). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.6(d)_, Buyer, in its sole discretion, may
unilaterally elect, in lieu of the issuance of a Substitute Unvested Award to
any given Foreign Continuing Employee (and in full satisfaction of any
obligation of Buyer with respect thereto or the underlying Unvested RSU), to
either (i) make a cash payment to such Foreign Continuing Employee equal to
the aggregate dollar value of such Unvested RSUs (calculated for each
Unvested RSU award as the product of (x) the average closing price of the
common stock of Seller on the NASDAQ for the 20-trading day period ending on
the Closing Date (or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the
Delayed Transfer Closing), multiplied by (y) the number of unvested shares
subject to such award), less applicable withholding Taxes, or (ii) issue a
Substitute Award that is a phantom award or similar derivative instrument, to
the extent Buyer, in good faith, determines that the issuance of such
Substitute Unvested Award would trigger the need for any filing, notice and/or
approval with a Governmental Authority outside of the United States or would
trigger adverse Tax consequences for the Continuing Employee, Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer. Prior to the Closing (or, with respect to any Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing), and subject to the
review and approval of Buyer, Seller shall take any and all actions necessary
to effect the transactions anticipated by this _Section 6.6(d)_ under the
applicable award agreements and Sellers equity compensation plan(s),
including adopting all resolutions and giving all requisite notices to each
Continuing Employee holding RSUs, Retention RSUs or performance-based RSUs.
Further, Seller shall take any and all actions necessary to effect the
termination of participation of any Continuing Employee in Sellers
employee stock purchase plan as of the Effective Time and to return any
unused employee contributions under such plan to the participating Continuing
Employees, in accordance with the terms of such plan.

 

(e) During the Continuation Period and subject to requirements under
applicable Law, Buyer and/or an Employing Entity shall honor, and cause to be
honored, all sales incentive programs existing as of the Agreement Date with
respect to the commissioned sales personnel, including "Club 116" and the "VIP
Achievers Plan" as described on _Schedule 6.6(e)_ to the Disclosure Letter,
in each case, for the period prior to Closing, as between Buyer and Seller,
only to the extent accrued (together with all employer-sided employment Taxes,
social or national insurance contributions or similar 

 



93  obligations as a result thereof) in Final Closing Net Working Capital;
_provided_ , _that_ , subject to applicable Law, Buyer may satisfy such
obligation by providing cash payments in lieu of any non-cash obligations
(and the pre-Closing portion of such amount shall be valued at the amount
accrued (together with all employer-sided employment Taxes, social or national
insurance contributions or similar obligations as a result thereof) with
respect thereto in Final Closing Net Working Capital). For the avoidance of
doubt, this _Section 6.6(e)_ does not pertain to Seller Sales and Commission
Plans, which are instead covered by _Section 6.6(s)_ below. To the extent
that, on the date of scheduled payment, any Continuing Employee to whom Buyer
is obligated to make a payment under this _Section 6.6(e)_ is employed in a
Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiary to, make such payment on behalf of Buyer and Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Seller for all such payments (together with all employer-sided
employment Taxes, social or national insurance contributions or similar
obligations as a result thereof) made on its behalf pursuant to this
sentence.

(f) Buyer or the applicable Employing Entity will credit each Continuing
Employee the amount of accrued and unpaid hours of vacation (to the extent
permitted by Law), personal hours, PTO or days earned, sick leave and any
other leave required to be credited by Law applicable to such Continuing
Employee as of or prior to the Closing, in each case, as between Buyer and
Seller, only to the extent accrued (together with all employer-sided
employment Taxes, social or national insurance contributions or similar
obligations as a result thereof) in Final Closing Net Working
Capital (collectively referred to herein as such Continuing Employees "
_accrued PTO_ "), and Seller will provide to Buyer as of the Closing Date a
schedule indicating for each Continuing Employee the type and number of days
of such accrued PTO for each Continuing Employee. Subject to applicable Law,
Buyer and/or an Employing Entity will use reasonable best efforts, subject to
applicable Law, to ensure that such accrued PTO is not subject to forfeiture
to the same extent not subject to forfeiture under the policies of Seller and
its Subsidiaries governing such accrued PTO prior to the Closing or applicable
Law; _provided_ that such accrued PTO may count toward any maximum accrual
amount under any plan, program or policy established by Buyer or transferred
to Buyer or an Employing Entity for the purpose of providing such leave. The
accrued PTO shall be treated as a current liability in the calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Automatic Transferred
Employees and Purchased Entity Employees shall not be terminated upon Closing
(or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer
Closing), but rather the rights, powers, duties, liabilities and obligations
of Seller or any of its respective Subsidiaries to such employees in respect
of the terms of employment with such employees in force immediately before
Closing (or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed
Transfer Closing) shall be transferred to Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries in
accordance with applicable employment Laws and Transfer Regulations and these
terms of employment shall remain applicable after the Continuation Period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that (i) the
applicable Laws of any jurisdiction including any applicable Transfer
Regulations, (ii) any collective bargaining agreement or other agreement with
a works council or economic committee, or (iii) any employment agreement,
would require Buyer or its Subsidiaries to provide any more favorable terms
of employment to any Foreign Continuing Employee than those otherwise provided
for by this _Section 6.6_ (or modify the period of time for which such
standards are met), in connection with the Purchase Transaction or other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, then Buyer will, or
will cause one of Buyers Subsidiaries to provide such Foreign Continuing
Employee with such more favorable terms, and otherwise provide terms
of employment in accordance with this _Section 6.6_.

(h) Seller and Buyer will, and will cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, cooperate to identify and use reasonable efforts to transfer to the
Purchased Entities, Buyer or its Subsidiaries any individuals engaged as
independent contractors or similar under applicable Law by Seller or any of
its Affiliates who are primarily engaged in the conduct of the Business.

 



94 (i) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer or an Employing Entity to
employ any Continuing Employee for any specific amount of time following the
Closing, and, unless applicable Law or a written agreement requires otherwise,
all Continuing Employees shall be employed by Buyer or an Employing Entity on
an at-will basis. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, however, Buyer
shall be responsible for, and shall perform and discharge, or cause to be
performed and discharged, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Subsidiaries from and against, all Liabilities that arise out of the
employment or the termination of employment by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries of the Continuing Employees (including any Automatic Transferred
Employees or Purchased Entity Employees) upon and following the Closing (or,
with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer
Closing), except for Deal Related Severance (unless payable by Buyer pursuant
to _Section 6.6(j)_). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with
respect to each Continuing Employee who incurs a Qualifying Termination
following the Closing (or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction,
the Delayed Transfer Closing), and during the Continuation Period, Buyer will,
or will cause an Employing Entity to, provide such employee with those
severance payments and termination benefits (less required withholding Taxes)
under the applicable formula set forth, or otherwise described, in Sellers
severance policies, jurisdictional guidelines or in individual employment
agreements or arrangements applicable to such Continuing Employee as in effect
August 1, 2015 (or, with respect to severance policies, to the extent such
Continuing Employee was not employed with Seller or its Subsidiaries on
such date, a Business Employee with a substantially comparable position as
such Continuing Employee) (the " _Seller Severance Policies_ ") for employees
based in the relevant jurisdiction under the Seller Severance Policies, or
any higher amount of severance and/or additional termination payments or
benefits as may be required by applicable Law (the " _Post-Transaction
Severance Benefits_ "). Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer
will, or will cause an Employing Entity to, pay or deliver the Post-
Transaction Severance Benefits (less required withholding Taxes) to any such
Continuing Employee whose employment is being terminated in a Qualifying
Termination as described in the preceding sentence as soon as reasonably
practicable following such termination of such Continuing Employees
employment. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Qualifying Termination_ "
means a termination by Buyer or the Employing Entity of the Continuing
Employees employment other than for Cause or a resignation by the Continuing
Employee of his or her employment that constitutes a Constructive Termination
unless a more employee-favorable standard applies in an individual employment
agreement or arrangement for such applicable employee (in which case such
definition shall apply).

(j) In addition, Seller and Buyer intend that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall not constitute a separation, termination or severance
of employment of any Business Employee prior to or upon the consummation of
the Purchase Transaction; and that the Business Employees will have
continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately
after the Operational Separation and the Closing Date (or, with respect to any
Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing), for all
purposes including but not limited to years of services for statutory and non-
statutory severance and other termination indemnities and Buyer and Seller
shall, and shall cause the Employing Entity (while under their
respective control) to, comply with any requirements under applicable Law to
ensure the same; _provided_ , _that_ , the foregoing shall in no event be
deemed to expand the obligations of either Party with respect to the provision
of (or the terms of) compensation, bonus amounts or benefits to any Business
Employee. Each Party shall assume, be responsible for, pay and discharge,
shall reimburse the other and shall indemnify and hold harmless the other and
its respective Subsidiaries from and against all, severance and other
termination benefits or other Termination Amounts of Business Employees in
accordance with the existing Seller Severance Policies with respect to, and
any and all other Liabilities of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries
arising out of such indemnifying Partys failure to comply with _Section
6.6(b)_ (including its failure to

 



95  send applicable Business Employees a Compliant Offer), _Section 6.6(c)_,
_Section 6.6(d)_, _Section 6.6(e)_, _Section 6.6(f)_, _Section
6.6(g)_ and _Section 6.6(i)_ hereof. Except as expressly set forth in the
preceding sentence, Seller shall be responsible for, pay and discharge,
reimburse Buyer and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
from and against all, severance and other termination benefits or Termination
Amounts of Business Employees triggered by actions or omissions occurring on
or prior to the Closing, including any Deal Related Severance.

 

(k) Excluding any accrued salary, accrued bonus, accrued PTO and accrued sales
commission amounts, in each case, to the extent included (together with all
employer-sided employment Taxes, social or national insurance contributions or
similar obligations as a result thereof) in the calculation of Final Closing
Net Working Capital, any Post-Transaction Severance Benefits, the amount that
may become payable by Buyer under _Section 6.6(j)_ and except as otherwise
set forth in this _Section 6.6_ (including _Section 6.6(d)_ and (x)) or as
otherwise provided under any New Benefit Plan or Assumed Benefit Plan (other
than to the extent self-funded), all of the foregoing of which shall be
included as Assumed Liabilities, Seller shall be responsible for and shall
perform and discharge, or cause to be performed and discharged, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Subsidiaries from and against, all
Liabilities respecting all current or former employees of Seller or its
Subsidiaries, including all Liabilities respecting Continuing Employees for
the period of their employment with Seller or its Subsidiaries until and
through the Closing (and all Liabilities respecting any other Person who were
at any time employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries), all Liabilities
under any Seller Benefit Plans incurred or claimed in respect of any Business
Employee or any other Person or their covered dependents for benefits or
claims arising with respect to the period on or prior to the Closing, any
Change of Control Bonuses, any Liabilities arising out of any claims made
by any current or former Business Employee or any other Person of Seller or
its Subsidiaries related to such Business Employees or other Persons period
of employment or service with Seller or one of its Subsidiaries on or prior to
the Closing, all Liabilities respecting any former Business employees or
current or former employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries whose
employment with Seller and its Subsidiaries has ceased prior to the Closing
and all other Liabilities related to each current or former employee of
Seller and its Subsidiaries (the " _Excluded Employee Liabilities_ "). To the
extent that, on the date of scheduled payment, any Continuing Employee to whom
Buyer is obligated to make a payment under this _Section 6.6(k)_ is employed
in a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiary to, make such payment on behalf of Buyer and Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Seller for all such payments (together with all employer-sided
employment Taxes, social or national insurance contributions or similar
obligations as a result thereof) made on its behalf pursuant to this sentence.

 

(l) Except to the extent provided in the Transition Services Agreement,
effective no later than 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the Closing Date (or
effective no later than Delayed Transfer Closing with respect to a Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction), except as required by applicable Law, each Continuing
Employee shall cease to participate in, or accrue further benefits under, any
Seller Benefit Plan (other than as a former employee of Seller and its
Subsidiaries to the extent, if any, permitted by the terms of such Seller
Benefit Plan) that are not Assumed Benefit Plans or New Benefit Plans.

 

(m) Without limiting the provisions of _Appendix H_ , Seller shall retain
responsibility for and continue to pay all medical, dental and vision
expenses and other benefit expenses, workers compensation benefits and life
insurance, disability and other welfare plan expenses for each Business
Employee (and covered dependents) with respect to claims incurred by such
Business Employee or his or her covered dependents prior to the Closing Date
(or, with respect to a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer
Closing) except to the extent that such expenses and benefits are payable
under any Assumed Benefit Plan or New Benefit Plan (to the extent that they
are not self-funded). Expenses and benefits with respect to claims incurred by
Continuing Employees or their covered dependents on or after the Closing Date
(or, with respect to a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer
Closing), and

 



96  expenses and benefits payable under any Assumed Benefit Plan or New Benefit
Plan (but, if incurred prior to the Closing, only to the extent such Assumed
Benefit Plan or New Benefit Plan is not self-funded), shall be the
responsibility of Buyer. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim is deemed
incurred: in the case of medical, vision or dental benefits, when the services
that are the subject of the claim are performed; in the case of
life insurance, when the death occurs; in the case of short-term or long-term
disability benefits, when the disability occurs; in the case of workers
compensation benefits, when the event giving rise to the benefits occurs; and
otherwise, at the time the Business Employee or covered dependent becomes
entitled to payment of a benefit (assuming that all procedural requirements
are satisfied and claims applications properly and timely completed and
submitted).

 

(n) To the extent permitted or required by applicable Law, except to the
extent it would result in the duplication of benefits, Seller will (as part
of the Operational Separation Activities for any given jurisdiction) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each New Benefit Plan that is a
health or welfare benefit plan, and Buyer will (from and after the Closing
(or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer
Closing) and during the Continuation Period) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each benefit plan of Buyer and its Affiliates which is
established for Continuing Employees that is a health or welfare benefit plan
(" _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") (or, with respect to New Benefit Plans that are a
health or welfare plans, cause such plans to continue) to (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and service conditions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Continuing Employees, (ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of such
Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) that were applied toward
the deductible and out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding Seller
Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums
or co-payments under a corresponding Buyer Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan
or Assumed Benefit Plan during the same plan year in which such payments,
charges and expenses were made, and (iii) with respect to any medical plan,
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
that would otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Employee following the
Closing Date. In addition, to the extent that any Continuing Employee has
begun a course of treatment with a physician or other service provider who is
considered "in network" under a Seller Benefit Plan and such course of
treatment is not completed prior to the Closing, Seller will (as part of the
Operational Separation Activities for any given jurisdiction) with respect to
each New Benefit Plan and each Assumed Benefit Plan, and Buyer, with respect
to the Buyer Benefit Plans from and after Closing (or, with respect to any
Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing), will use
reasonable efforts to arrange for transition care, whereby such
Continuing Employee may complete the applicable course of treatment with the
pre-Closing physician or other service provider at "in network" rates.

 

(o)(i) As part of Operational Separation, Seller (with respect to New Benefit
Plans in which a Continuing Employee is anticipated to participate) and (ii)
from and after the Closing (or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing), Buyer and an Employing Entity
(with respect to their benefit plans in which a Continuing
Employee participates, which following Closing includes New Benefits Plans
and Assumed Benefits Plans) will use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide credit for such Continuing Employees length of service with Seller
and its Subsidiaries (including any length of service with any entity
acquired by Seller or any such Subsidiary) for purposes of eligibility,
participation, vesting and benefit accrual under such plan, program, policy or
arrangement, including severance policies, except that such prior service
credit will not be required (or, in the case of New Benefit Plans, provided)
to the extent that it results in a duplication of benefits. Seller will
provide to Buyer as of the Closing Date a schedule indicating the length
of service of each Continuing Employee with Seller and its Affiliates through
the Closing Date.

(p) During the Continuation Period (but, not before the U.S. Benefits
Transition Date), Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries will cover each U.S.
Continuing Employee who has elected to

 



97  participate in a flexible spending account plan maintained by Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries (" _Seller s FSA_") under the New Benefit Plan
established pursuant to Schedule 2.7(a) of the Disclosure Letter as a
flexible spending account plan (" _Buyer s FSA_") at the same level of
coverage elected under Sellers FSA (including a New Benefit Plan, as
applicable) for the remainder of the plan year during which the Closing Date
(or, to the extent the Closing Date occurs prior to January 1, 2016, the U.S.
Benefits Transition Date (such date, the " _U.S. Health and Welfare Transition
Date_ ")) occurs. Each U.S. Continuing Employee will be treated as if his or
her participation in Buyers FSA had been continuous from the beginning of the
plan year under Sellers FSA in which the U.S. Health and Welfare Transition
Date occurs and each existing salary reduction election electronically funded
to the Sellers FSA will be transferred and taken into account for the
remainder of the plan year under Buyers FSA in which the U.S. Health and
Welfare Transition Date occurs, as if made under Buyers FSA. Buyers FSA
will provide reimbursement for medical care expenses and dependent care
expenses incurred by U.S. Continuing Employees at any time during the plan
year under Sellers FSA in which the U.S. Health and Welfare Transition Date
occurs (including claims incurred before the Closing), up to the amount of
such U.S. Continuing Employees elections and reduced by amounts previously
reimbursed by Sellers FSA. Within 20 Business Days following the U.S. Health
and Welfare Transition Date, Seller will (i) provide to Buyer an accounting of
the amounts elected, deducted and paid in respect of claims under Sellers FSA
in respect of the U.S. Continuing Employees during the plan year in which the
Closing occurs and before the U.S. Health and Welfare Transition Date, and
(ii) pay to Buyer the net amount, if any, of the excess of the aggregate
amount deducted over the aggregate amount paid in respect of claims
under Sellers FSA in respect of each U.S. Continuing Employee during the
plan year in which the U.S. Health and Welfare Transition Date occurs.

 

(q) Except pursuant to (and for the periods covered by) the Transition
Services Agreement with respect to Continuing Employees, effective as of the
Closing (or the U.S. Health and Welfare Transition Date), the applicable
Employing Entity will assume and be responsible for (i) all Liabilities with
respect to U.S. Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, in respect
of health insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1985, as amended, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996, Sections 601, et seq. and Sections 701, et seq. of ERISA, Section
4980B and Sections 9801, et seq. of the Code and applicable state or similar
Laws, and (ii) to the extent applicable, all workers compensation benefits
payable to or on behalf of the U.S. Continuing Employees incurred with
respect to events occurring on or after Closing. Subject to _Section 6.6(j)_,
Seller shall be solely responsible for any continuation coverage required by
COBRA for those terminated Business Employee who are not
Continuing Employees, and their qualified beneficiaries.

(r) On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the appropriate Employing
Entity to establish a 401(k) plan and a related trust (the " _Buyer s 401(k)
Plan_") which shall (i) be intended to meet the tax qualification requirements
of Section 401(a) of the Code, the tax exemption requirements of Section
501(a) of the Code, and the requirements described in Sections 401(k) and
401(m) of the Code in respect of a plan intended to meet such requirements and
(ii) be substantially similar to the Symantec Corporation Section
401(k) Plan, as restated and amended January 1, 2015 and further amended from
time to time through the Closing in accordance with this Agreement (the "
_Seller 401(k) Plan_ "). Buyer shall, by acquisition of the
applicable Employing Entity at Closing, assume such Buyers 401(k) Plan and
permit each U.S. Continuing Employee who meets the eligibility criteria of the
Buyers 401(k) Plan to participate (or continue participation) in such plan.
Each Continuing Employee who is a participant in the Seller 401(k) Plan shall
cease to be an active participant or actively accrue benefits in such plan
effective as of the date such Continuing Employee transfers to the Buyers
401(k) Plan (and no later than the Closing Date). As of the Closing Date,
Seller shall take all actions necessary to fully vest each Continuing Employee
in his or her benefits under the Seller 401(k) Plan and Buyers 401(k) Plan
and Seller shall contribute to Seller 401(k) Plan or Buyers 401(k) Plan, as
applicable, all employer contributions and matching contributions relating to
periods prior to the Closing based on the amount or

 



98  percentage that Seller is required to contribute to such plan on behalf of
such Continuing Employees through the Closing as if such employees had
satisfied all prerequisites for receiving such contributions as of the
Closing; _provided_ , _that_ , subject to the true-up payment described below
in the following sentence, Seller shall only be required to make employer
contributions and matching contributions to the extent such employer
contributions and matching contributions would have otherwise been required to
have been made as of such date in accordance with the terms of the Seller
401(k) Plan (such employer contributions and matching contributions which
relate to a period prior to the Closing but which are not contributed as of
the Closing in accordance with this proviso, " _Delayed Matching
Contributions_ "). As promptly after the Closing as reasonably practicable and
consistent with past practice and in accordance with applicable Law, Seller
shall contribute to (or to the extent impracticable or not legally permitted,
pay to Buyer for contribution into) the Buyers 401(k) Plan and related trust
that constitutes a 401(k) plan all Delayed Matching Contributions. Seller
shall cause the Buyers 401(k) Plan and related trust that constitutes a
401(k) plan to permit a true-up for employer matching contributions and accept
the contributions as described herein (including the Delayed Matching
Contributions), and Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to
effectuate the contributions contemplated by this _Section 6.6(r)_, including
providing information and data necessary to complete the calculations to
determine the amount of such true-up contribution. Effective no later than
Closing, Seller shall take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to
transfer the (i) accrued benefit obligations for such Continuing Employee, as
well as a proportionate share of assets, if any, whether in a trust or
otherwise, related to such obligations and (ii) elections, including
beneficiary and distribution elections associated with such Continuing
Employee under the Seller 401(k) Plan to Buyers 401(k) Plan.

(s) Without limiting the provisions of this _Section 6.6_ and as identified
on _Schedule 6.6(s)_  to the Disclosure Letter, (i) with respect to the
fiscal year of Seller in which the Closing occurs and with respect to each
Continuing Employee, Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable Employing
Entity of such Continuing Employee to, make a bonus payment to such
Continuing Employee in an amount equal to the amount accrued (together with
all employer-sided employment Taxes, social or national insurance
contributions or similar obligations as a result thereof) in the Final Closing
Net Working Capital with respect to the Seller Annual Bonus Plan for such
Continuing Employee, if any, which bonus payment shall be made not later than
the same time or times Seller pays such bonuses in the ordinary course of
business, (ii) with respect to any Seller Retention Bonus Agreement (other
than a Seller Retention Bonus Agreement that constitutes a Change of Control
Bonus, which is an Excluded Liability) for any payments unpaid and/or unearned
thereunder as of the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable
Employing Entity of such Continuing Employee to, make a payment pursuant to
such Seller Retention Bonus Agreements in an amount equal to the sum of (x)
the amount accrued (together with all employer-sided employment Taxes, social
or national insurance contributions or similar obligations as a result
thereof) in the Final Closing Net Working Capital with respect to such
Continuing Employee, if any, and (y) the remainder of the target bonus
amount with respect to such Continuing Employee under such Seller Retention
Bonus Agreement (provided that Buyer or the applicable Employing Entity shall
be entitled to make reasonable and appropriate modifications to the
performance or achievement goals of such Seller Retention Bonus Agreement),
which payment shall be made no later than the same time or times Seller would
have been required to pay such bonuses in the ordinary course of business and
(iii) with respect to any Seller Sales and Commission Plans in effect as of
the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable Employing Entity of
such Continuing Employee to, make such payments under the Seller Sales and
Commission Plans as they are earned by such Continuing Employee, if any,
which payment shall be made no later than the same time or times Seller pays
such sales and commission payments in the ordinary course of business, but, to
the extent relating to any employment or events occurring prior to the
Closing, only to the extent such amounts are accrued (together with all
employer-sided employment Taxes, social or national insurance contributions or
similar obligations as a result thereof) in the Final Closing Net Working
Capital. In addition to the foregoing, following the Closing (or Delayed
Transfer Closing, as applicable) and with respect to plan year in effect at
the time of the Closing under the Seller

 



99  Annual Bonus Plan, Buyer agrees that it shall, or shall cause the applicable
Employing Entity to, provide for a target bonus opportunity under a bonus plan
of Buyer (or its applicable Subsidiary) for each Continuing Employee to
receive a payment pursuant to Section 6.6(s)(i) equal to the such Continuing
Employees target bonus opportunity as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date (or Delayed Transfer Closing, as applicable) multiplied by a
fraction, (x) the numerator of which is total number of days remaining between
Closing (or Delayed Transfer Closing, as applicable) and the end of Sellers
plan year under the Seller Annual Bonus Plan for the year in which the
Closing occurs and (y) the denominator of which is the total number of days
under the Seller Annual Bonus Plan. For purposes of determining the Final
Closing Net Working Capital, the amount to be accrued for each
Seller Retention Bonus Agreement (other than a Seller Retention Bonus
Agreement that constitutes a Change of Control Bonus) shall be equal to
maximum amount payable under such Seller Retention Bonus Agreement (together
with all employer-sided employment Taxes, social or national insurance
contributions or similar obligations as a result thereof), multiplied by a
fraction (A) the numerator of which is total number of days for determining
whether such bonus is earned that transpire prior to the Closing Date and (B)
the denominator of which is the total number of days for determining whether
such bonus is earned under such Seller Retention Bonus Agreement. Seller shall
reimburse, indemnify defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates for
any Losses or amounts owed to any Business Employee under any Seller Sales and
Commission Plans with respect to sales or other events occurring prior to the
Closing except to the extent accrued (together with all employer-
sided employment Taxes, social or national insurance contributions or similar
obligations as a result thereof) in the Final Closing Net Working Capital. To
the extent that, on the date of scheduled payment, any Continuing Employee to
whom Buyer is obligated to make a payment under this _Section 6.6(s)_ is
employed in a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiary to, make such payment on behalf of Buyer and Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Seller for all such payments (together with all employer-sided
employment Taxes, social or national insurance contributions or similar
obligations as a result thereof) made on its behalf pursuant to this sentence.

 

(t) Following the Agreement Date, each of Seller and Buyer (and their
respective Subsidiaries) will use reasonable best efforts in all
matters necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section
6.6_ and the requirements of any applicable Law or Transfer Regulations and
will provide, and will cause each of their respective representatives,
including legal, human resources and regulatory compliance personnel, to
provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by the other Party in that
regard, including, (i) cooperating and providing each other with all necessary
and reasonable assistance and information to ensure that any works councils
or committees, trade unions and/or employee representatives applicable to the
Foreign Continuing Employees are provided with the information required in
order for proper consultation, notification and other required processes
under applicable Law to take place and conducting such consultations,
notifications and other required processes, as necessary, and (ii) exchanging
information and data, including reports prepared in connection with bonus
plan participation and related data of Continuing Employees, relating to
workers compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverages,
including information and data that are necessary to support or perform any
compensation consultant process or that is otherwise reasonably requested in
connection with any compensation consultant process (in each case, except to
the extent prohibited by applicable Law or to the extent that such information
and data relates to performance ratings or assessments of employees of Seller
and its Affiliates), making any and all required filings and notices, making
any and all required communications with Business Employees and obtaining any
Governmental Approvals required with respect to the actions contemplated by
this _Section 6.6_. Further, in no event shall anything herein be interpreted
as requiring Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any Business Employee
(or group thereof) with any additional compensation or benefits except as may
be required by applicable Law. Such cooperation will include the provision of
any information and consultation required by applicable Law or Transfer
Regulations (which shall include, in the case of Buyer, information required
by any applicable Transfer Regulations regarding any measures Buyer

 



100  envisages it will take with respect to any Automatic Transferred Employees
after Closing) or the terms of any Contract, or with any works council,
economic committee, union or similar body. Each of Seller and Buyer will make
available its representatives at such times and in such places as the other
Party may reasonably request for purposes of discussions with representatives
of any such works council, economic committee, union or similar body.

(u) The Parties recognize that certain of the Business Employees are in
nonimmigrant visa status in the United States or have applications for lawful
permanent residence pending with the relevant Governmental Authorities in the
United States (the " _Affected Foreign Employees_ "). The Parties further
recognize that new or amended petitions with respect to such Affected Foreign
Employees may be required in certain of these cases, unless Buyer (or its
Affiliates, as the case may be) is deemed the "successor-in-interest" to
Seller or any of its Affiliates, as applicable (as such term is used in
pronouncements and interpretations by the United States Department of Homeland
Security (" _DHS_ ")) and/or the United States Department of Labor (" _DOL_ ")
with respect to such Affected Foreign Employees. Accordingly, Buyer hereby
expressly agrees to assume, and Seller hereby assigns, all of the immigration-
related Liabilities related to validly filed petitions of the Affected Foreign
Employees (including, without limitation, any obligations, Liabilities and
undertakings arising from or under attestations made in each certified and
still effective Labor Condition Application, Labor Certification
Application/PERM, and/or Permanent Resident Alien petition validly filed
by Seller with respect to any such Affected Foreign Employees). The Parties
each agree to take such actions as may reasonably be requested at and
following the Closing to document to the DHS or such other governmental
agency, as the case may be, as may be necessary, the "successor-in-interest"
relationship with respect to any Affected Foreign Employees.

(v) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to
mitigate and/or minimize the impact of the tax consequences of Section 280G of
the Code, to the extent applicable, that are reasonably likely to result from
the Purchase Transaction and/or other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under all employment, severance and termination agreements, other
compensation arrangements and Seller Benefit Plans, with respect to the
deductibility of compensation or any Taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the
Code of any individual that is regarded as a "disqualified individual" (as
such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) of
Seller or its Affiliates; _provided_ , _that_ , in no event will Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries be required to pay any amount, grant or alter any rights
or contractual provisions or incur additional costs, expenses or Liabilities
in connection with the foregoing, other than general reasonable internal
costs, overhead and reasonable use of internal personnel and assets or
infrastructure.

(w) On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall establish an New Benefit Plan
for Continuing Employees that are a non-qualified deferred compensation plan
(such New Benefit Plan, the " _Buyer NQDCP_ ") and related rabbi trust (the "
_Buyer Rabbi Trust_ "), the terms of which shall be substantially similar to
(and not materially more favorable to the employees than) those of the Seller
NQDCP and Seller Rabbi Trust, and Seller shall cause the Continuing Employees
to begin participation (or be eligible to participate in, such Buyer NQDCP)
in such Buyer NQDCP to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
eligible to participate in the Seller NQDCP. In connection with the
establishment of the Buyer NQDCP and the assumption by the applicable
Purchased Entity and the Buyer NQDCP of the Liabilities under the Seller NQDCP
in respect of the Continuing Employees, on or as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter, Seller shall, or shall cause the Seller Rabbi Trust
to, transfer in kind to the Buyer Rabbi Trust the aggregate account balances
of Continuing Employees covered by such plans determined as of the date of the
transfer. Buyer and Seller agree that for purposes of Code Section 409A,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute a
"separation of service" (as defined under Code Section 409A) with respect to
Continuing Employees, nor give rise to a specific distribution event under
Code Section 409A or the terms of the Seller NQDCP or Buyer NQDCP.

 



101 (x) _Pension Assumptions and Transfers_.

 

(i) As part of Operational Separation, Seller will, or will cause its
Subsidiaries to, (x) continue to establish or maintain in the name of a
Purchased Entity one or more New Benefit Plans that are retirement plans or
that provide Retirement Benefits (such plan or plans, a " _New Business
Retirement Plan_ ") in each country in which a Business Employee who
participated in, or was eligible to participate in, a Seller Retirement Plan
that is not an Assumed Benefit Plan (each such Seller Retirement Plan that is
not an Assumed Benefit Plan, an " _Applicable Seller Retirement Plan_ ")
immediately prior to the Agreement Date, in accordance with _Schedule 2.7(a)_
of the Disclosure Letter and (y) to the extent permitted by Law or collective
bargaining (or similar) agreement cause each Business Employee participating
in the Applicable Seller Retirement Plan to which such New Business Retirement
Plan relates to cease participation in such Applicable Seller Retirement Plan
and begin participation in such New Business Retirement Plan.

 

(ii) Effective as of the Closing Date (or Delayed Transfer Closing with
respect to a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction), Buyer shall, or shall cause an
Affiliate of Buyer to, assume or retain sponsorship of, and retain or assume
all assets (if any) and Liabilities relating to (in each case, either directly
or indirectly through its acquisition of the applicable Purchased Entity and
the Assumed Benefit Plans that are Seller Retirement Plans), the New Business
Retirement Plans sponsored and maintained by the Purchased Entities. The
Seller Retirement Plans that are Assumed Benefit Plans, taken together with
the New Business Retirement Plans, are referred to herein as the " _Business
Retirement Plans_ ".

(iii) To the extent permitted by Law or collective bargaining (or similar)
agreement, Seller shall cause (A) each Applicable Seller Retirement Plan to
transfer the benefit liabilities, regardless of whether such benefits are
vested or unvested, under such Applicable Seller Retirement Plan to the
extent relating to the Business Employees and (B) the corresponding New
Business Retirement Plan in such jurisdiction to accept a transfer of such
liabilities. The Business Employees shall be given credit under the
respective New Business Retirement Plan for all service with and compensation
from Seller and its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining eligibility,
vesting and the amount of any benefits or benefit accruals under each
respective New Business Retirement Plan. The date that a Business Employee
ceases participation in the Applicable Seller Retirement Plan and begins
participation in the corresponding New Business Retirement Plan (which may,
with respect to Applicable Seller Retirement Plans that are termination
indemnity and seniority premium arrangements and mandatory government and
social security pension arrangements be the Closing Date (or, with respect to
a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Closing Date)) is referred to
herein as the " _Transfer Date_ " with respect to such plan.

(iv) To the extent permitted by Law or collective bargaining (or similar)
agreement or as may become necessary in connection with the labor consultation
process related to the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller shall cause
the Applicable Seller Retirement Plans (and shall use reasonable efforts to
require the administrators thereof) to transfer assets in an amount equal to
the amount of assets required by applicable Law or collective bargaining (or
similar) agreement to be transferred from such Applicable Seller Retirement
Plan to the corresponding New Business Retirement Plan in connection with the
assumption of the benefit liabilities, or such higher amount of assets as may
be reasonably determined advisable by Seller, but not to exceed the amount of
the transferred benefit liabilities (subject to applicable Law and, for this
purpose, calculated in accordance with the Pension Calculation Principles
(but, for this purpose only, determined as of the Transfer Date for such
Applicable Seller Retirement Plan))

 



102  and as equitably adjusted downward to take into account benefit payments
made from such Applicable Seller Retirement Plan to the Business Employees,
and those former employees who were Business Employees prior to their
termination of employment, after the Transfer Date but prior to the date of
transfer and for any earnings and losses on such amount during such period.
Seller shall cause the applicable New Business Retirement Plan (and shall use
reasonable efforts to require the administrators thereof) in such jurisdiction
to accept such transfer of assets as described in the preceding sentence.
Except as required by Law or collective bargaining (or similar) agreement or
as may become necessary in connection with the labor consultation process
related to the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller shall not make (and
shall cause its Affiliates and the corresponding Applicable Seller Retirement
Plans (or the administrators thereof) not to make) any contribution of assets
or purchase of additional funding through insurance or otherwise or commit to
make any contribution of assets or purchase of additional funding through
insurance or otherwise that would increase the amount of assets required to
be transferred to the applicable New Business Retirement Plan as described
above. Prior to the Closing Date (or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer Closing), except as required by Law or
collective bargaining (or similar) agreement or as may become necessary in
connection with the labor consultation process related to the transactions
contemplated hereby, or as required by the terms of the New Business
Retirement Plan, Seller shall not make (and shall cause its Affiliates and
the corresponding New Business Retirement Plans (or the administrators
thereof) not to make) any contribution of assets or purchase of additional
funding through insurance or otherwise or commit to make any contribution of
assets or purchase of additional funding through insurance or otherwise that
would increase the amount of assets of any New Business Retirement Plan as of
the Closing Date (or, with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the
Delayed Transfer Closing). Seller agrees and, following the Closing Date (or,
with respect to any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, the Delayed Transfer
Closing), Buyer agrees, to use commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish
each transfer of assets to a New Business Retirement Plan described in this
_Section 6.6(x)_, including making, and cooperating in good faith to make,
such filings and disclosures and obtain such approvals as may be deemed
necessary or advisable with the foregoing in accordance with applicable Law,
including obtaining consent of the Business Employees to the extent required
by applicable Law. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
that all assets transferred to a New Business Retirement Plan in accordance
with this _Section 6.6(x)_ shall be transferred in the form of cash,
insurance contracts or marketable securities, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law or the terms of the Applicable Seller Retirement Plan. To the
extent a corresponding Applicable Seller Retirement Plan is not funded by
applicable Law or is not voluntarily funded as of the applicable Transfer
Date, there shall be no transfer of assets by the Applicable
Seller Retirement Plan or by Seller or its Affiliates. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that each of the Business
Retirement Plans transfers to Buyer at Closing (or Delayed Transfer Closing,
as applicable) or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable.

(v) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (A)
except as specifically provided in _Section 6.6(r)_, _6.6(w)_ and _6.6(x)_ ,
as between Seller and Buyer, neither Buyer nor its Subsidiaries (including the
Purchased Entities following Closing (or Delayed Closing, as applicable))
shall have any Liability (for the avoidance of doubt including current or
future obligations to provide compensation or benefits (whether arising out
of, with respect to or relating to service with Seller, its Affiliates or
their respective predecessors or otherwise)) arising under, in connection
with or with respect to, any Seller Retirement Plans (including any Business
Retirement Plan) or any other benefit plan of Seller or its Affiliates that is
a pension or retirement plan or any other plan, scheme or arrangement which
provides Retirement Benefits to any employees of Seller or its Affiliates
(whether Continuing Employee, Business Employee, or otherwise), and, as
between Buyer and Seller, all such Liabilities shall be 

 



103  the responsibility of Seller and shall be deemed Excluded Employee
Liabilities for all purposes of this Agreement and (B) other than the Business
Retirement Plans, the Buyers 401(k) Plan and the Buyer NQDCP, neither the
Seller Retirement Plans or any other benefit plan of Seller or its Affiliates
that is a pension or retirement plan or any other plan, scheme or arrangement
which provides Retirement Benefits to any employees of Seller or its
Affiliates (whether Continuing Employee, Business Employee, or otherwise)
shall be an Assumed Benefit Plan or New Benefit Plan. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased
Entities following the Closing) are required to honor, pay or provide any of
the Excluded Employee Liabilities, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer or such Subsidiary thereof for any such items so honored, paid or
provided. In the event Seller or its Subsidiaries (excluding the Purchased
Entities following the Closing) are required to honor, pay or provide any
payments, compensation or benefits otherwise agreed pursuant to this Agreement
to be paid or provided by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased
Entities following the Closing), Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller or such Subsidiary of Seller for any such items so honored, paid or
provided.

 

(y) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to take any action they are
legally required to take in order to comply with local employment Laws.

(z) Provided that Buyer or its Affiliates provide the payroll service provider
in respect of Business Employees in the United States such information and
work requirements as it shall require to treat Buyer and its Affiliates as a
successor employer of Seller and its Affiliates for purposes of Section 3121
of the Code in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(which information and work requirements the Parties shall reasonably
cooperate to prepare, compile and develop), Seller shall, if requested by
Buyer, instruct such payroll service provider(s) (and take such other
reasonable actions as required) to effect such successor employer treatment
for purposes of Section 3121 of the Code. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer, prior to, at or reasonably promptly
after the Closing, for each Continuing Employee, such Continuing Employees
Form I-9s and Forms W-4 and W-5 (as applicable). Seller shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take reasonably
necessary or appropriate actions, which are reasonably requested by Buyer to
assist in transferring to Buyer, or obtaining for Buyer, any work permit or
similar approval required for any Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or collective bargaining
(or similar) agreement, in the event an applicable work permit for such
employee is not in place with Buyer or its Subsidiary as of the Closing, the
Parties shall reasonably cooperate to provide for the services of
such employee to be made available exclusively to Buyer through an employee
secondment, services or similar arrangement under which Buyer shall be
responsible for the economic costs of such individuals compensation and
benefits (including reimbursement for any expenses incurred by such employee,
all applicable fees and Taxes with respect thereto) for such service period on
commercially reasonable terms until the applicable work permit can be
obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall continue to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the applicable work permit.

(aa) The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Purchased Assets include, to
the extent permitted by Law and the terms of the applicable agreement, and
Seller shall assign to Purchased Entities, in each case, Sellers and its
Affiliates rights to enforce all employee non-competition, non-solicitation,
confidentiality, assignment of inventions and similar restrictive covenant
agreements with any Business Employee, and such rights (but not obligations)
under such agreements with any former Business Employee or employee who
performed services for the Seller or its Subsidiaries, in each case, to the
extent such rights relate to the Business. The Parties agree and acknowledge
that the Purchased Assets shall exclude (and the Excluded Assets
shall include), to the extent permitted by Law and the terms of the
applicable agreement, and Seller shall retain Sellers and its Affiliates
rights to enforce all

 



104  employee non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, assignment of
inventions and similar restrictive covenant agreements with any Business
Employee, and such rights (but not obligations) under such agreements with
any former Business Employee or employee who performed services for the Seller
or its Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent such rights relate to the
businesses of Seller other than the Business.

 

(bb) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and except as required by Law, nothing herein, expressed or implied,
is intended or shall be construed to (a) constitute an employment agreement or
an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or
provided to Business Employees prior to or following the Closing, (b) confer
upon or give to any Person, other than the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section
6.6_ under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement (it being
understood that each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this _Section 6.6_ without any requirement to prove that it
has suffered damages) or (c) prohibit Buyer (or any of its Subsidiaries) from
terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee following the Closing
Date. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall any Business Employee
be deemed to be a third party beneficiary, or otherwise entitled to enforce,
any provision of this Agreement (other than, to the extent expressly set forth
therein, _Section 6.9_). Further, in the event that Seller, on the one hand,
or Buyer on the other hand, (as applicable, the " _Paying Party_ ") is
required to retain, honor, pay or provide any of the items contemplated to be
assumed, honored, paid or provided by the other under this _Section 6.6_
(the " _Responsible Party_ "), such Responsible Party shall indemnify and
hold harmless such Paying Party for any such items so retained, honored, paid
or provided by such Paying Party.

 

(cc) Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the date of this
Agreement, at Buyers reasonable request, with respect to each New Benefit
Plan and Assumed Benefit Plan, Seller shall provide to Buyer, to the extent
applicable and reasonably available: (A) true and complete copies of all
written plan documents (including amendments and modifications thereof) and
all summary plan descriptions and similar plan summaries, (B) any opinion or
determination letter or similar document received from any Governmental
Authority, if applicable, (C) all material notices of or correspondence with
any Governmental Authority as to any matter related to such plans compliance
with applicable Law, and (D) to the extent no written plan documents are
available, a list of all such New Benefit Plans or Assumed Benefit Plans.

 

(dd)(i) Until 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 2016 (the " _U.S. Benefits Transition
Date_ "), Seller shall permit the U.S. Business Employees participating in
the Sellers Kaiser Permanente Group Number 23409 (Northern California),
Kaiser Permanente Group Number 227314 (Southern California), Cigna Choice Fund
HRA Plan, Cigna Open Access Plus (OAP) Plan, Cigna Global Plan (HMO), Metlife
Preferred Dentist Program, and Group Vision Care Plan - VSP (the " _Seller
U.S. Benefits Transition Plans_ " ) to continue to participate in the Seller
U.S. Benefits Transition Plans. If the Closing Date occurs prior to the U.S.
Benefits Transition Date, then Seller shall permit Continuing Employees to
continue participation in the Seller U.S. Benefits Transition Plans under the
terms and conditions set forth in that certain Transition Service Schedule 47
attached to the Transition Services Agreement. Effective as of the U.S.
Benefits Transition Date, Seller shall have established New Benefit Plans that
provide for the benefits provided under the Seller U.S. Benefits Transition
Plans and shall transfer the sponsorship of such plans to the applicable
Operating Entity (the " _New U.S. Transition Health and Welfare Plans_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, the New U.S. Transition Health and Welfare Plans will
be established in accordance with the terms, conditions and procedures
described in _Schedule 2.7(a_ ) of the Disclosure Letter for New Benefit Plans
generally, except that the New U.S. Transition Health and Welfare Plans shall
not be deemed part of (or a condition of) Operational Separation. Seller
shall cause the U.S. Continuing Employees to cease participation in each
Seller Benefit Plan and transition to, and be participating in (or be eligible
to participate in), the New U.S. Benefit Plans as of the U.S. Benefits
Transition Date.

 



105 (ii) For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers obligations with respect to
New Benefit Plans in respect of all U.S. Benefit Plans other than the Seller
U.S. Benefits Transition Plans shall be subject to the provisions of _Schedule
2.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter.

 

 _Section 6.7_ _Insurance Matters_. Buyer acknowledges that certain policies
and insurance coverage maintained on behalf of the Business on the Agreement
Date may be part of the corporate insurance program maintained by Seller and
its Subsidiaries and related to businesses other than the Business, in which
case, subject to the terms of this _Section 6.7_, such coverage will not be
available or transferred to Buyer. From and after the Closing Date, the
Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by
Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies or by any of their self-
insured programs, and Seller and any of its Affiliates may, to be effective at
the Closing, amend any insurance policies in the manner it deems appropriate
to give effect to this _Section 6.7_. From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall be responsible for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for
its operation of the Business. Buyer covenants and agrees not to seek to
assert or to exercise any rights or claims of the Business or any Purchased
Entity under or in respect of any past or current insurance policy under
which the Business or any Purchased Entity is a named insured; _provided_ ,
_however_ , with respect to (a) events relating to the Assumed Liabilities or
(b) losses or damages related to the Purchased Assets, the Purchased Entities
or their assets, each of which occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date
and which are covered by Sellers or its Subsidiaries occurrence-based third-
party liability insurance policies and which involved assets that would have
been included in the Purchased Assets but for the fact that they were damaged
or destroyed and were not replaced by Seller or its Subsidiaries with
comparable assets included in the Purchased Assets, (i) Buyer may promptly
notify Seller of any matter that is reasonably expected to give rise to a
claim under any such policy (provided, that, the failure to promptly notify
Seller shall not relieve Seller from its obligations under clause
(ii), except to the extent that Sellers ability to pursue such claim or
recover under such policies is actually and materially prejudiced thereby),
and (ii) Seller shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to make claims, under
such policies to the extent such coverage and limits are available under such
policies and any insurance proceeds received with respect thereto shall be
promptly delivered to Buyer (calculated net of reasonable expenses incurred in
procuring such recovery and any increase in premiums or retroactive premium
adjustments or chargebacks paid by or on behalf of Seller or its Subsidiaries
as a result of such claims, and taking into account the available coverage
under each relevant insurance policy, it being understood that such coverage
shall first be available to satisfy other claims of Seller or its Subsidiaries
pending under such policy at the time the claim for the benefit of Buyer is
made). Seller agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue all
such claims; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall exclusively bear (and
Seller shall have no obligation to repay or reimburse Buyer for) the amount of
any deductibles associated with claims made under such policies and programs.
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in connection with making such claim and each
Party shall provide the other with all reasonably requested information
necessary to make such claim. To the extent Seller or its Subsidiaries
receives any property or casualty insurance proceeds after the date hereof in
connection with the damage or complete destruction of any Purchased Assets or
assets that would have been included in the Purchased Assets but for such
damage or complete destruction and were not replaced by Seller or its
Subsidiaries with comparable assets included in the Purchased Assets, Seller
shall at or promptly following the Closing (or, if later, promptly following
the date received) pay over to Buyer such proceeds, in each case calculated
net of reasonable expenses incurred in procuring such recovery and any
increase in premiums or retroactive premium adjustments or chargebacks paid by
or on behalf of Seller or its Subsidiaries as a result of such claims
(and which amount shall not be deemed to be Business Cash).

 



106 _Section 6.8_ _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Indemnification_. (i) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses incurred,
sustained, suffered or paid by such Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of or
as a result of: (A)(1) Taxes of the Purchased Entities for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, (2) Taxes imposed on the Purchased Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (3) Taxes imposed on the Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and
(4) Taxes arising out of any termination of intercompany accounts in _Section
6.18_ or the release set forth in _Section 6.18(d)_, (B) Taxes (for the
avoidance of doubt including any VAT or any Transfer Taxes) imposed as a
result of the Operational Separation Activities contemplated by _Section 2.7_
and _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter, (C) Transfer Taxes or VAT
that the Seller is responsible for under this _Section 6.8_, (D) Taxes
arising out of any breach of any covenant made by Seller in this _Section
6.8_ or any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
_Section 4.8_, and (E) Taxes arising under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury
Regulations or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law by virtue
of any Purchased Entity having been a member of a consolidated, combined,
affiliated, unitary or other similar tax group or fiscal unit prior to the
Closing, in each case other than Taxes as a result of any action by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date or any action taken outside the
ordinary course of business by Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the
Closing but on the Closing Date (other than (a) any action or transaction
contemplated by this Agreement including actions taken pursuant to  _Section
6.18_ or with respect to the Section 338(g) Elections, (b) actions taken at
the direction of Seller or (c) actions required by applicable Law (without a
reasonable alternative)) (collectively, the " _Excluded Tax Liabilities_ ").
Notwithstanding that a claim for Taxes or Losses may fall into multiple
categories of this _Section 6.8(a)(i)_, a Buyer Indemnified Party may not
recover for the same specific amount of Taxes or Losses more than one time.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement and for the avoidance of
doubt, the limitations in _Section 9.2_ shall not apply to this _Section
6.8(a)(i)_ (other than as expressly provided in _Section 9.2(c)_). For the
avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of the Tax matters set forth on _Schedule
4.8_ of the Disclosure Letter shall not alter Sellers indemnification
obligations to Buyer for Taxes in this  _Section 6.8_ or in _Article 9_.

(ii) Except to the extent subject to indemnification pursuant to  _Section
7.1(a)(i)_ or _Article 9_ , Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses incurred, sustained,
suffered or paid by such Seller Indemnified Party arising out of or as a
result of: (A) Taxes of the Purchased Entities for all Post-Closing Tax
Periods, (B) Taxes imposed on the Purchased Assets for any Post-Closing Tax
Period, (C) Taxes imposed on the Business for any Post-Closing Tax
Period, (D) Taxes arising out of any breach by Buyer of any covenant in this
_Section 6.8_, (E) Taxes arising out of any action taken outside the ordinary
course of business by Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing but on
the Closing Date, except to the extent such action was expressly contemplated
by this Agreement (including actions taken at the direction of Seller) or
required by applicable Law (without a reasonable alternative), (F) Taxes in
respect of Restricted Assets, Restricted Split Interests and Split Interests
as described in _Section 2.6_ and (G) any Transfer Taxes or VAT that Buyer is
responsible for under this _Section 6.8_. Notwithstanding that a claim for
Taxes or Losses may fall into multiple categories of this _Section
6.8(a)(ii)_, a Seller Indemnified Party may not recover for the same specific
amount of Taxes or Losses more than one time. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, the limitations
in _Section 9.2_ shall not apply to this _Section 6.8(a)(ii)_ (other than as
expressly provided in _Section 9.2(c)_).

 

(iii) To the extent reasonably practicable (or as otherwise reasonably
agreed), Seller and Buyer shall or shall cause the tax year of each Purchased
Entity (including by making elections with any relevant Taxing Authority) that
begins before but has not closed prior to the Closing Date to close (x) first,
on the end of the day on the Closing Date to the extent permitted

 



107  by applicable Law or (y) second, on the end of the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date to the extent permitted by applicable Law. In the case of any
Taxes where an applicable Straddle Period is not or cannot be closed pursuant
to this _Section 6.8(a)(iii)_, the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (including for purposes of
determining the amount of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period with
respect to such Straddle Period) shall be deemed to be (i) in the case of
Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes),
the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period up
through and ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period,
and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (i) (such as franchise
Taxes or Taxes that are based on or related to income, receipts or specific
transactions), the amount of any such Taxes shall be determined based upon an
interim closing of the books as if such taxable period ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date which shall be deemed to be 11:59 pm on the
Closing Date and shall include all Taxes applicable to transactions that have
been consummated during the period prior to such time. With respect to any
Purchased Entity or Purchased Minority Interest that is a flow through entity
for Tax purposes or a "controlled foreign corporation" (as defined under the
Code), Pre-Closing Taxes shall include any Taxes on the allocable income of
such entity as if it was allocated pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(vi) as if Seller had sold all of its direct or indirect
interests in all Purchased Entities or Purchased Minority Interests
immediately before the end of the taxable period ending on the Closing Date,
based on an interim closing of the books method.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event will Buyer
or any Affiliate of Buyer be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnified
Party for any Taxes to the extent a current asset attributable to such Taxes
(such as prepaid Taxes) was included in Final Closing Net Working Capital.

 

(b) _VAT and Transfer Taxes_. (i) The Liability for all VAT and Transfer Taxes
payable in connection with the consummation of the Purchase Transaction and
the transfer of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller except that any VAT and
Transfer Tax as payable in connection with the Operational Separation
Activities, the transfer of the Purchased Shares of the new Acquisition Entity
to be formed in Ireland shall be borne one hundred percent (100%) by Seller; 
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, any VAT or Transfer Taxes that
are actually recovered by Buyer, Seller or any of their Affiliates are subject
to _Section 6.8(e)(ii)_ of this Agreement and Buyer and Seller shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable efforts to obtain
any recovery, credit or refund with respect to any such Taxes and to cooperate
in providing any information or documentation that may be reasonably necessary
to obtain such recovery, credit or refund by the other Party or its
Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, such reasonable efforts shall not
include any change to the operations of either Party (or any of its
Affiliates) or require either Party (or any of its Affiliates) to implement
any further Tax planning techniques to obtain any such recovery, credit or
refund.

(ii) The Parties shall cooperate to minimize the amount of VAT and Transfer
Taxes payable, including by claiming any available exemption or relief or any
available refund, credit or other recovery and by promptly executing and
filing any invoices, forms or certificates reasonably required. The parties
shall provide each other with any information reasonably requested in order to
comply with applicable VAT and Transfer Tax Laws, where such information is
connected with the VAT or Transfer Taxes treatment or position in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The amount of any
refund, credit or other recovery received or utilized by a Party (or any of
its Subsidiaries)

 



108  of any VAT or Transfer Taxes borne by the other Party (or any of its
Affiliates) pursuant to this Section 6.8(b) shall be paid by that Party to the
other Party, other than with respect to VAT paid by or on behalf of the
Seller or its Subsidiaries to the appropriate Taxing Authorities in the
Peoples Republic of China which would have otherwise been refunded, credited
or recovered by Buyer (or any of its Subsidiaries) (which may be retained by
Buyer and its Subsidiaries).

(iii) Each of Seller and Buyer shall prepare and timely file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation required to be filed by such party with
respect to all VAT and Transfer Taxes arising in connection with the
consummation of the Purchase Transaction, consistently with the amount of such
VAT and Transfer Taxes as determined pursuant to this _Section 6.8(b)_, and,
if required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

 

(iv) As between Buyer and Seller, the determination of the amount of any
Transfer Taxes or VAT (including whether any exemption from (or reduction in
or credit for) Transfer Taxes or VAT is available) required to be paid with
respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be made by Seller in good faith in its reasonable discretion
in consultation with Buyer. In the event Buyer reasonably disagrees with
Sellers determination with respect to any such Transfer Tax or VAT and
obtains prior to the applicable due date of the applicable Tax Returns with
respect to such Taxes an opinion (for the avoidance of doubt, addressed to
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, and not to Seller, but a copy of which is
provided to Seller) that Buyers position "should" prevail, Buyers position
shall control and Seller and Buyer shall file the applicable Tax Returns
consistent with such opinion. The cost of the "should" opinion is to be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller.

 

(v) Without limiting the indemnification rights and obligations of the parties
with respect to Transfer Taxes and VAT, unless the Parties mutually agree
otherwise, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with any Transfer
Taxes or VAT shall be prepared and filed by the Party required by Law to file
such Tax Returns (the " _Transfer Tax Returns_ "), and such Party shall pay
the Transfer Taxes or VAT shown on such Tax Return within the period specified
by applicable Law. The filing party shall provide the other Party with a draft
copy of such Tax Return which it is required to file (and for which any Taxes
thereon are the responsibility of the other Party) at least seven Business
Days before such Tax Returns are due to be filed and shall consider in good
faith any comments provided by such other Party. All such Tax Returns
shall be consistent with the allocation of the Final Consideration as
determined pursuant to _Section 3.3_. Buyer and Seller shall settle any of
their obligations for any Liability for Transfer Taxes or VAT paid by the
other party for which they are liable within 10 Business Days of being
invoiced by the other party for such amount.

(c) _Additional VAT Matters_. (i) If the sale of any Purchased Asset to Buyer
or applicable Other Buyer under this Agreement is subject to VAT, Seller or
the relevant Other Asset Seller shall prepare and promptly file the
appropriate VAT documentation in a timely manner with the applicable Taxing
Authority. Seller shall deliver a copy of any draft VAT invoices and other
required VAT documentation to Buyer for Buyers review and input of any
necessary information about the applicable Buyer Affiliate. The Parties shall
include accurate and complete VAT invoices as required by applicable Law and
in a timely manner. Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable efforts and
cooperate in good faith to determine the appropriate rate of VAT and to exempt
or relieve the transfer to Buyer or applicable Other Buyer of the Purchased
Assets from any VAT to the extent permitted by applicable Law, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, ensuring to the extent permitted that the transfer of
Purchased Assets is treated as neither a supply of services nor a supply of
goods for purposes of VAT.

(ii) Should any Taxing Authority provide notification that VAT was applied in
error and refunds such amount to Seller, then (A) Seller shall without
unreasonable delay from the date it receives

 



109  such refund provide Buyer with a valid credit note (to the extent of Buyers
responsibility for such VAT hereunder); and (B) if the VAT applied in error
was paid by Buyer to Seller, Seller shall without unreasonable delay from the
date it receives such refund repay to Buyer any such VAT under the condition
that Buyer cooperates in ensuring, where reasonably possible, that Seller will
be able to correct this error with its competent tax office and obtain a VAT
credit from the tax office for the VAT that was charged in error.

(iii) At the Closing where the Purchased Assets include an interest in real
property and the transfer of such Purchased Assets is, or is treated as being,
not liable to VAT, Buyer and Seller will cooperate to the extent permitted by
Law to ensure that the transfer of such real property interest qualifies for
such treatment.

(d) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 6.8(b_) or _Section 6.8(d)(ii)_, Seller
shall, and shall cause the Other Asset Sellers and/or the Purchased Entities
to prepare or cause to be prepared and duly file or cause to be duly filed
within applicable statutory limits all Tax Returns of or that include the
Purchased Entities or the Purchased Assets (including amendments thereto)
that (x) are due to be filed (giving effect to any extension of time to file)
on or prior to the Closing Date or (y) are for Tax periods that end on or
prior to the Closing Date (" _Seller-Signed Tax Returns_ ")); _provided_ ,
_that_ , with respect to Seller-Signed Tax Returns of Purchased Entities that
are filed following the Closing Date and Seller-Signed Tax Returns of
Acquisition Entities that are filed before the Closing Date, in each case
that are Income Tax Returns, Seller (A) shall provide Buyer with a draft copy
of each such Seller-Signed Tax Return at least 45 Business Days before the due
date for the filing of such Tax Return (including extensions), (B) shall
consider in good faith any comments provided by Buyer within 20 Business Days
after receipt of the draft from Seller, and (C) shall provide Buyer with a
finalized copy of such Tax Return at least 10 Business Days before such
due date. Seller shall not file such Tax Return until the earlier of (x) the
receipt of written notice from Buyer indicating Buyers consent thereto, or
(y) one day prior to the due date. All Seller-Signed Tax Returns of any
Purchased Entity shall (to the extent related to the Purchased Shares,
Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the Business) be prepared using
accounting methods and other practices that are consistent with those used in
the Tax Returns filed prior to the Closing (except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or to correct any clear errors).

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Buyer-Signed Tax Returns in a timely manner with the appropriate Taxing
Authorities, using accounting methods and other practices that are consistent
with past practice of the Business (except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or to correct any clear errors); _provided_ that Buyer (A)
shall provide Seller with a draft copy of each such Buyer-Signed Tax Return at
least 45 Business Days before the due date for the filing of such Tax Return
(including extensions), (B) shall consider in good faith any comments provided
by Seller within 20 Business Days after receipt of the draft from Buyer, and
(C) shall provide Seller with a finalized copy of such Tax Return at least 10
Business Days before such due date. Buyer shall not file such Tax Return until
the earlier of (x) the receipt of written notice from Seller indicating
Sellers consent thereto, or (y) one day prior to the due date. As
used herein, " _Buyer-Signed Tax Returns_ " shall mean all Tax Returns of
each Acquisition Entity that are due to be filed (giving effect to any
extension of time to file) following the Closing Date that are for Tax periods
that end on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



110 (iii) Each Straddle Period Tax Return shall be prepared and filed, or caused
to be prepared and filed, with the appropriate Taxing Authority (A) by Buyer,
if it or any of its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) are
permitted to file such Tax Return under applicable Law or (B) by Seller, if
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) are not permitted
to file such Tax Return under applicable Law, in each case, in a timely manner
using accounting methods and other practices that are consistent with past
practice of the Business (except as otherwise required by applicable Law or
to correct any clear errors); _provided_ that such filing party (x) shall
provide the other Party with a draft copy of such Tax Return at least 20
Business Days before the due date for the filing of such Tax Return
(including extensions), (y) shall consider in good faith any comments provided
by such other Party and (z) shall provide the other party with a finalized
copy of such Tax Return at least 10 Business Days before such due date. The
Party preparing the Straddle Period Tax Return shall not file such Tax Return
until the earlier of (1) the receipt of written notice from the other Party
indicating other Partys consent thereto, or (2) one Business Day prior to
the due date. As used herein, " _Straddle Period Tax Returns_ " shall mean all
Tax Returns for Straddle Periods that are of the Purchased Entities or relate
to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business, in each
case other than Transfer Tax Returns and Tax Returns of the Purchased Minority
Interests.

(iv) With respect to each Tax Return described in this _Section 6.8(d)_, the
party required to file such Tax Return (or cause such Tax Return to be filed)
pursuant to this _Section 6.8(d)_ (the " _Tax Return Filer_ ") shall timely
pay to the relevant Taxing Authority the amount, if any, shown as due on such
Tax Return; _provided_ that if the Tax Return Filer is not permitted to make
such payment under applicable Law, then the Parties shall cooperate in
good faith to arrange for such amount to be paid to the relevant Taxing
Authority in a manner permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the obligation to make payments pursuant to this _Section 6.8(d)(iv)_
shall not affect such Tax Return Filers right, if any, to receive payments
under _Section 6.8(d)(v)_ or otherwise be indemnified under this Agreement
with respect to any Taxes.

 

(v) On or before the due date of any Tax Return described in this _Section
6.8_ (including extensions), the relevant Tax Return Filer shall notify the
other Party of any amounts shown as due on such Tax Return (and to be paid by
such Tax Return Filer and its Affiliates), or any portions of any such
amounts, for which the other Party must indemnify the Tax Return Filer under
this Agreement, and such other Party shall pay such amounts (or portions
thereof) to the Tax Return Filer no later than such due date or, if later, 10
Business Days after the date on which notice of such amounts (or portions
thereof) is provided by the Tax Return Filer pursuant to this _Section
6.8(d)(v)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, failure of the
Tax Return Filer to notify the other Party as described in the preceding
sentence or provide any Tax Return prior to its filing shall not modify or
affect such Tax Return Filers rights hereunder (including the right to
indemnification for any Taxes reflected on such Tax Return) or the indemnity
obligations of the other Party except to the extent failure to do so would
actually and materially prejudice the other Party.

(e) _Settlement Payments_. (i) Other than with respect to VAT, any Party that
receives or becomes entitled to (or whose Affiliate receives or becomes
entitled to) any Tax refund (or credit for overpayment) with respect to Taxes
for which the other Party would be liable under  _Section 6.8(a), (b) or
(c)_ (a " _Refund Recipient_ ") shall pay to the other Party the entire amount
of such refund or credit to the extent attributable to payments made by such
other Party (including any interest thereon from the Taxing Authority, but
net of (x) any Taxes imposed by, a Taxing Authority with respect to such
refund or credit (or other additional Tax payable as a result thereof), (y)
costs to obtain any such refund or credit and (z) any cost incurred in
preparing any claim for such refund or credit), (A) in the case of a

 



111  refund actually received, no more than 20 Business Days after receiving such
refund and (B) in the case of the application of such refund as a credit
against future Taxes, no more than 20 Business Days after the filing of the
Tax Return utilizing such credit (but only to the extent such credit actually
reduced Taxes of the Refund Recipient for a Post-Closing Tax Period or for
which it would have otherwise be responsible under this Agreement (determined
on a "with and without" basis)); _provided_ that if such Refund Recipient is
required to repay to the relevant Taxing Authority such refund or credit, the
other Party shall, upon the request of such Refund Recipient, repay the
amount previously paid to such other Party pursuant to this _Section 6.8(e)_
in respect of such refund or credit (plus any penalties, interest or other
charges imposed by the relevant Taxing Authority).

 

(ii) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or in connection with the
resolution of any Tax Claim in accordance with  _Section 6.8(f)_, Buyer
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, (A) make or change any Tax
election of the Purchased Entities or related to the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the Business for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (it being
understood and agreed that Buyer shall be permitted to make or file a tax
election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to any Purchased Entity
identified as potentially making such election on _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the
Disclosure Letter without Sellers consent and any Liability for Taxes as a
result of any such election under Section 338 of the Code shall be borne by
Seller), (B) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of
any applicable statute of limitations with respect to) any Seller-Signed Tax
Return, Buyer-Signed Tax Return that includes a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period Tax Return or (C) carry back any Tax attribute, including any
loss, credit, credit carry forward, prepaid Tax or refund, and any claim for
or right to receive any of the foregoing (a " _Tax Attribute_ ") of any of the
Purchased Entities from a Tax period ending after the Closing Date to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, in each case, without Sellers prior written consent (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law or in connection with the resolution of any Tax
Claim in accordance with  _Section 6.8(f)_, neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates (including, after Closing, any Purchased Entities) shall take any
of the following actions without the consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such action would reasonably be expected
to result in an increase in Taxes of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(excluding any Purchased Entities) for any taxable period: (i) filing any
amended Tax Return of any Purchased Entities with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, (ii) making or changing any tax election with respect to any
Purchased Entities in connection with a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iii)
settling, compromising or otherwise conceding any Tax Claim relating to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Purchased Entities, in each case, on or after
the Closing Date (each, a " _Post-Closing Tax Action_ "). Sellers or any of
its Affiliates consent to a Post-Closing Tax Action shall relieve Buyer of
any responsibility for any such increase in Taxes of Seller or any of its
Affiliates resulting from such Post-Closing Tax Action. Buyer shall notify
Seller of any proposal to take a Post-Closing Tax Action that would reasonably
be expected to result in an increase to Taxes imposed on Seller or any of its
Affiliates (excluding any Purchased Entities) for any period compared to the
amount of Taxes that would have been imposed had Buyer not taken such Post-
Closing Tax Action, and Seller shall, within 30 Business Days of receiving
such notice, inform Buyer of Sellers decision whether to consent to such
Post-Closing Tax Action. If Buyer or any of its Affiliates does carry back a
Tax Attribute to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Purchased Entity, then (x)
no payment with respect to such carryback shall be due to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates from Seller or any of its Affiliates and (y) if Buyer or any of its
Affiliates receives any refund, credit or offset of any Taxes in connection
with such carryback, Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the amount of such
refund or the economic benefit of the credit or offset to the extent relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and, in the case of a credit or offset, to
the extent it actually reduced Taxes of Buyer or its Affiliates for a Post-
Closing Tax Period or for which it would otherwise have been responsible under
this Agreement

 



112  (determined on a "with and without" basis), with such payment to Seller
including interest thereon from the Taxing Authority, but net of (x) any Taxes
imposed with respect to such interest, refund, credit or offset (or other
additional Tax payable as a result thereof) and (y) any reasonable,
incremental out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with
obtaining such refund, credit or offset. After the Closing, Seller shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, amend any Tax Returns, change
any Tax elections or accounting methods with respect to any of the Purchased
Entities, the Purchased Minority Interests, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the Business to the extent such amendment or change
would reasonably be expected to result in additional Taxes or other costs to
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities and Purchased
Minority Interests) for which it would not otherwise be indemnified under
_Section 6.8_.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates be required to pay to Seller any refund,
credit or other recovery (or provide Seller and benefit with respect thereto
or any interest thereon), whether pursuant to this Section or any other
Section of this Agreement, to the extent such matter was set forth as an asset
in the Final Closing Net Working Capital, and in no event shall Seller or any
of its Affiliates be required to pay to Buyer any amount (or provide Buyer
any benefit with respect thereto or any interest thereon), whether pursuant to
this Section or any other Section of this Agreement, to the extent such matter
was set forth as a liability in the Final Closing Net Working Capital.

 

(f) _Cooperation and Assistance_.

 

(i) The Parties shall cooperate with each other in the filing of any Tax
Returns and the conduct of any audit or other Proceeding with respect to a
Tax Claim for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or which otherwise relates to Taxes
addressed in this _Section 6.8_. They each shall execute and deliver such
powers of attorney and make available such other documents as are reasonably
necessary to carry out the intent of this _Section 6.8_.

(ii) If either Party is liable under this _Section 6.8_, for any portion of
a Tax shown due on any Tax Return required to be filed by the other Party
pursuant to this _Section 6.8_, the Tax Return Filer shall deliver a copy of
the relevant portions of such Tax Return (taking into account any extensions,
if applicable) to the liable Party. If the Parties disagree as to the
treatment of any item shown on such Tax Return or with respect to any
calculation with respect to any Tax Return to be filed pursuant to this
_Section 6.8_, an independent public accounting firm acceptable to both
Seller and Buyer shall determine, consistent with Sellers past practice
(except as otherwise required by Law), how the disputed item is to be treated
on such Tax Return (" _Accountant s Determination_"). If the Accountants
Determination has not been made prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return, the Party required to file such Tax Return may file such Tax Return
as it deems appropriate, and if the subsequent Accountants Determination is
that such Tax Return should have been filed in some other manner, the filing
Party shall amend such Tax Return in accordance with the
Accountants Determination. The fees and expenses with respect to the
Accountants Determination, including fees and costs of counsel reasonably
incurred in connection with the Accountants Determination, shall be shared by
the Parties in inverse proportion (based on the disputed amounts proposed by
each to the independent public accounting firm) as they may each prevail on
matters resolved by the independent public accounting firm.

 

(iii) Upon reasonable request, each Party shall deliver to the tax director of
the other Party certified copies of all receipts for any foreign Tax with
respect to which such

 



113  other Party or any of its Affiliates would reasonably be expected to claim a
foreign tax credit or comparable tax reduction together with such supporting
documents required in connection with claiming or supporting a claim for such
a foreign tax credit or comparable tax reduction.

(iv) The Parties shall retain records, documents, accounting data and other
information in whatever form that are reasonably necessary for the preparation
and filing, or for any Tax audit, of any and all Tax Returns with respect to
any Taxes that relate to Tax periods that begin on or prior to the Closing
Date. Such retention shall be in accordance with the record retention policy
of the respective Party, but in no event shall any Party destroy or otherwise
dispose of such records, documents, accounting data and other information
prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
extensions) and without first providing the other Party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and copy the same. Each Party shall give any other
Party reasonable access to all such records, documents, accounting data and
other information as well as to its personnel and premises to the extent
necessary for a reasonable review or a Tax audit of such Tax Returns and
relevant to an obligation under this _Section 6.8_.

(v) Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to provide Buyer with a
clearance certificate or similar document(s) which may be required by any
Taxing Authority to relieve Buyer of any obligation to withhold any portion of
the payments to Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(g) _Tax Controversies_. A Party shall promptly notify the other Party in
writing (in no event later than 20 Business Days) (a " _Notification_ ") upon
receipt of written notice of any pending or threatened audits or assessments
with respect to Taxes for which such other Party (or any of its Affiliates) is
liable under this _Section 6.8_ or may give rise to an indemnification
payment under this _Section 6.8_. Failure to give such Notification shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from Liability under this _Section 6.8_,
except if and to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby. Subject to further provisions of this _Section
6.8(g)_, each Party shall be entitled to conduct, direct, control and be
responsible for the complete defense of any tax audit or administrative or
court Proceeding (a " _Tax Claim_") relating to Taxes for which it may be
solely liable, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; _provided_
, _that_ , in the event Seller or any of its Affiliates is defending such Tax
Claim, any settlement or other disposition of any such Tax Claim that may
affect Buyer or any Affiliate thereof for any Post-Closing Taxable Period or
for which it may otherwise be responsible may only be made with the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
Seller shall also be entitled to take control of the complete defense of any
Tax Claim relating to Taxes for which it may be partially liable; _provided_
 that Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to
participate in any Tax Claim relating to Taxes for which it may be partially
liable. If Seller controls a Tax Claim relating to Taxes for which Buyer may
be partially liable, (i) Seller shall control the Tax Claim diligently and in
good faith, (ii) Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding the
status of such Tax Claim, and (iii) Seller shall not, without the prior
written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld), settle, resolve,
or abandon any such Tax Claim. If Seller chooses not to control a Tax Claim
which it has the authority to control hereunder, (A) Buyer may assume control
the Tax Claim, (B) Buyer shall, to the extent it controls such defense, keep
Seller reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Claim, (C) Seller
shall have the right to participate in such Tax Claim at its sole cost and
expense, and (D) Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller
(not to be unreasonably withheld), settle, resolve, or abandon any such Tax
Claim. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 6.8(g)_, each
Party shall be entitled to take control of the complete defense of any Tax
Claim for which both Parties are partially liable, and to employ counsel of
its choice at its expense; _provided_ that such Party unconditionally releases
in writing the other Party from any indemnification obligation hereunder with
respect to such Tax Claim and agrees in writing to pay any Taxes of the other
Party resulting from such

 



114  Tax Claim, including Taxes related to such Tax Claim that arise in taxable
years prior to or subsequent to the year of the Tax Claim. This _Section
6.8(g)_ shall govern to the extent it would otherwise be inconsistent with
_Section 9.3_.

(h) _Section 338(g) Elections_. Buyer and Seller shall agree on and include
in _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter a list of any Purchased Entities
incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction for which Buyer or Other Buyers, as the
case may be, will be permitted to make an election under Section 338(g) of
the Code (and any corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign Tax
Law) with respect to each such Purchased Entity (the " _Section 338(g)
Elections_ "). Seller will reasonably cooperate with Buyer or Other Buyers,
as the case may be, to the extent Buyer or Other Buyers, as the case may be,
decides to make any such Section 338(g) Election for such Purchased Entities
previously agreed to by the Parties. Buyer shall file its Form
8883 consistent with the Allocation Methodology prepared by Seller and
consistent with the provisions in _Section 3.3_. This _Section 6.8(h)_ shall
be subject to _Section 3.3_ (for the avoidance of doubt, disputes
between Buyer and Seller with respect to the allocation of Purchase Price
will be subject to the provisions of _Section 3.3_).

(i)  _Purchase of the Purchased Assets and Purchased Entities_. The Americas
IP (as defined in _Schedule 3.3_ of the Disclosure Letter) shall be purchased
by Buyer or Other Buyers organized under the laws of the United States or
Ireland. The Transferred Intellectual Property Rights and the Transferred
Technology that is not Americas IP shall be purchased by Buyer or Other Buyers
organized under the laws of Ireland. Veritas Technologies LLC will be
purchased by Buyer or Other Buyers organized under the laws of the United
States. As of the Closing, Seller shall have not made an election under
Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 for Veritas Technologies LLC to be
classified as a corporation. In the event that (x) Buyer and each Other Buyer
is not organized under the laws of the jurisdictions set forth on _Schedule
6.8(i)_ of the Disclosure Letter or (y) with respect to the jurisdictions
indicated on _Schedule 6.8(i)_ of the Disclosure Letter, Buyer or such Other
Buyer is not organized under the laws of the same jurisdiction as the
Purchased Entity it purchases and, in either case such failure results in any
incremental withholding Tax imposed on Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (except to the extent de minimis) that would not have occurred
had the Buyer or Other Buyers used the jurisdictions set forth on _Schedule
6.8(i)_ of the Disclosure Letter, then Buyer shall fully indemnify Seller
therefor and acknowledge in writing such indemnity obligation.

_Section 6.9_ _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) If the Closing occurs, for a period of six years after the Closing, Buyer
shall and shall cause the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries to take
any necessary actions to provide that all rights to indemnification or expense
advancement and all limitations on Liability relating to the Business existing
in favor of the Business Indemnitees as provided in the DandO Indemnity
Arrangements shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and continue in full force and effect and be honored by the Purchased
Entities and their Subsidiaries after the Closing (or be replaced with such
rights and limitations as are no less favorable thereto). As used herein, (x)
the " _Business Indemnitees_ " means individuals who at or prior to the
Closing were current or former officers, directors, individual managers
or employees of the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries (or the
predecessors of the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries) relating to
service in such capacities prior to the Closing and (y) the " _D andO
Indemnity Arrangements_" means (i) the Organizational Documents of the
Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries in effect on the Agreement Date,
(ii) any agreement providing for indemnification by the Purchased Entities and
their Subsidiaries of any of the Business Indemnitees in effect on the
Agreement Date (or in effect thereafter on the same standard form used by
Seller and its Subsidiaries in the jurisdiction in question) to which Seller,
the Purchased Entities and/or their Subsidiaries are a party or (iii) if a
Purchased Entity is not formed as of the Agreement Date but formed prior to
the Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement, the formation documents of
such Purchased Entity containing customary indemnification and expense
advancement provisions substantially similar to (and not more favorable than)
the provisions in the documents referred in clause (i).

 



115 (b) In the event that the Purchased Entities, their Subsidiaries or Buyer or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Purchased Entities, their Subsidiaries or Buyer, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

(c) The obligations of Buyer under this _Section 6.9_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom
this _Section 6.9_ applies without the express written consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this  _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.9_).

(d) At or prior to the Closing, Buyer may, in its sole discretion, purchase
and pay in full all premiums relating to directors and officers liability
and fiduciary liability insurance coverage for all Business Indemnities that
covers on a primary basis acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing
(including, at the election of Buyer, with respect to acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) for such coverage period, retention or
deductible amounts, coverage limit and other terms as Buyer, in its sole
discretion, determines appropriate. One-half of the cost of any premiums for
such policy shall be treated as a transaction expense payable by Seller. For
the avoidance of doubt, any such prepaid insurance shall not be included as a
current asset for purposes of calculating the Final Closing Net Working
Capital.

 

(e) This _Section 6.9_ shall in no event limit Buyers or the other Buyer
Indemnified Parties rights, or Sellers obligations, under _Article 9_ (it
being understood that the indemnification or expense amounts paid or advanced
by Buyer or its Affiliates to Business Indemnities under this _Section 6.9_
may, to the extent indemnifiable pursuant to  _Section 9.1(a)_, be Losses
for purposes thereof).

_Section 6.10_ _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending five (5) years
after the Closing Date, Seller will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not
to, anywhere in the world, participate or engage in (whether directly, as a
consultant, through a joint venture or other means of deriving revenues or
benefits, including by providing Intellectual Property Rights), or hold
any ownership interest in any Person who engages in, a business that competes
with, the Business, including, without limitation, the research, design,
development, manufacturing, production, marketing, sale, distribution,
installation, license or servicing of any product, or the provision of any

Management Applications_ " means Technology, products and services designed,
developed, made, manufactured, used, imported, distributed, installed,
licensed, sold, offered for sale, maintained, and supported for information
management, including: (a) information storage, backup, and recovery
(including for preventing loss of such information); (b) storage management,
clustering, and availability; (c) disaster recovery; (d) archiving, discovery,
analysis and retrieval; and (e) data analytics, de-duplication, and machine
learning applications in support of any of the foregoing, in each case for any
platform, end point, or application, including without limitation servers,
PCs, tablets, mobile devices, and other digital computing devices, embedded
devices, or systems, and whether delivered as on-premise software, firmware,
hardware, appliances, or cloud based services. Competing Activities expressly
exclude, without limitation, Technology, products and services designed,
developed, made, manufactured, used, imported, distributed, installed,
licensed, sold, offered for sale, maintained,

 



116  and supported for: (i) end point management, application management, or

data; or (vi) data analytics, de-duplication, and machine learning
applications in support of any of the foregoing, in each case for any
platform, including servers, PCs, tablets, and mobile devices, and other
digital computing devices, embedded devices, or systems and whether delivered
as on-premise software, firmware, hardware, appliances, or cloud-based
services.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing clause (a),
Seller and its Subsidiaries may in all events:

(i) engage in any business conducted by Seller or its Subsidiaries on the
date of this Agreement other than the Business and continue to sell its
products and services as of the date of this Agreement other than Products
(including, without limitation, all backup products related to the Norton
business), and any new releases, updates, and successors to such products and
services; _provided_ that Seller will not add to the backup products and
services related to the Norton business, or alter or enhance any existing
features or functionality to provide, (A) any of the following Information
Management Applications that are not currently offered in such Norton backup
products or services: clustering, discovery, data analytics, and machine
learning applications that compete with, or would reasonably be deemed to
compete with, the Business, or (B) any other features or functionality, or new
methods or means of accomplishing such new features or functionality, or that
provide a centralized solution for backup or storage, or management of backup
or storage functionality, across more than 100 end points associated with a
given customer (or its Affiliates) or licensee (or its Affiliates);

 

(ii) continue to perform its obligations under any Retained Contracts in
accordance with the Retained Contracts Agreement and perform any Competing
Activity for the benefit of Buyer or any of its Affiliates as required or
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

 

(iii) acquire any Person, or one or more divisions or lines of business of a
Person, that engages in a Competing Activity by merger or a purchase or
shares or assets of a Person so long as (x) immediately prior to the time of
such acquisition, the Competing Activity does not account for more than 20% of
the aggregate annual gross revenues of such Person, or divisions or lines of
business of such Person, to be so acquired for its most recent fiscal year
preceding the acquisition and (y) such Person, or divisions or lines of
business of such Person, to be so acquired did not in the most recent fiscal
year preceding the acquisition derive more than $100,000,000 of revenue in
such one-year period from Competing Activity (in each case based, to the
extent available, on the most recently available annual consolidated financial
statements of such Person or annual financial statements of such divisions or
lines of business of such Person); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that in the
event of such acquisition where the aggregate annual gross revenue related to
the Competing Activity exceeds 20% of the aggregate annual gross revenue of
the Person or divisions or lines of business of such Person, Seller shall
nevertheless be permitted to acquire such Person or business but, in such
event, shall be required to divest the portion of the Person or business that
engages in Competing Activity to an unaffiliated third party as soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event within 12 months of the acquisition
thereof; _provided_ that such 12-month period shall be extended to the date
on which all approvals from a Governmental Authority required to complete the
divestiture are received (to no later than the second anniversary following
the acquisition of such Person or divisions or lines of business of such
Person) if such approvals are not received by the end of such 12-month
period;

 



117 (iv) own and operate any Person, division or line of business acquired
in compliance with clause (iii) above (subject to the terms thereof); and

(v) directly or indirectly hold interests in or securities of any Person
engaged in a Competing Activity to the extent that such investments do not,
directly or indirectly, confer on Seller and/or its Subsidiaries, in the
aggregate, 10% or more of the voting power or economic interests of such
Person and, Seller and its Subsidiaries remain passive investors and are not
involved in the operations of such Person (other than board seats and board
observer seats reasonably commensurate with the size of the investment).

 

(c) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending 24 months
after the Closing Date, Seller will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not
to, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire or, in such jurisdictions where
such restriction would not be prohibited by Law, hire in any capacity (whether
as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise) any
employee of Buyer or its Subsidiaries who has the title of director or other
equivalent or higher position that was a Business Employee immediately prior
to the Closing. This restriction shall not apply to Persons who have been
terminated by Buyer or its Subsidiaries without "Cause" or who have resigned
due to "Constructive Termination" prior to commencement of employment
discussions between Seller or its Subsidiaries or its or their representatives
and such Person and nothing in this clause (c) shall restrict Seller or its
Subsidiaries from engaging in general or public searches, solicitations or
advertising by or on behalf of Seller or such Subsidiary (including through
search firms) that is not specifically directed towards any such Person
described in the first sentence of this clause (c) or the employees of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries.

(d) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending 24 months
after the Closing Date, Buyer will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not
to, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire or, in such jurisdictions where
such restriction would not be prohibited by Law, hire in any capacity
(whether as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise) any
employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries who has the title of director or other
equivalent or higher position. This restriction shall not apply to Persons
who have been terminated by Seller or its Subsidiaries without "Cause" or who
have resigned due to "Constructive Termination" prior to commencement of
employment discussions between Buyer or its Subsidiaries or its or their
representatives and such Person and nothing in this clause (d) shall restrict
Buyer or its Subsidiaries from engaging in general or public searches,
solicitations or advertising by or on behalf of Buyer or such Subsidiary
(including through search firms) that is not specifically directed towards any
such Person described in the first sentence of this clause (d) or the
employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements set
forth in this _Section 6.10_ were a material inducement to the other Party
to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. Seller
hereby acknowledges that the restrictive covenants set forth in _Section
6.10(a)_ are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area restrictions and
are limited to the scope that is necessary to protect the goodwill of the
Business and to prevent the impairment of the value of the substantial
investment therein being made by Buyer hereunder. The Parties agree that, if
any court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment
determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a
specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this _Section
6.10_ is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature which
is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against
public policy may be enforced against the applicable Party. It is agreed that
any

 



118  breach or threatened breach of the restrictive covenants set forth in this
_Section 6.10_ would cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching Party and
that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to the non-breaching
Party.

_Section 6.11_ _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Payments; Post-Closing IPR
Transfer_.

(a) _General Assurances_. In addition to the actions specifically provided for
elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties will cooperate with each
other and use its reasonable efforts, prior to, at and after the Closing Date,
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things reasonably necessary or appropriate on its part to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Purchase
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the
satisfaction of the respective conditions set forth in  _Article 7_ and
including the execution and delivery of such other instruments, certificates,
agreements and other documents and the performance of such other actions as
may be necessary or reasonably desirable to consummate and
implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents; _provided_ that all such actions are in
accordance with applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to
time, whether at or after the Closing, (A) Seller and its Subsidiaries (as
appropriate) will execute and deliver such further instruments, certificates,
agreements and other documents and perform such other actions, at Buyers sole
expense (unless such action is otherwise expressly contemplated to be
performed by (or caused to be performed by) Seller by this Agreement or
another Transaction Document or to the extent any Buyer Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under _Article 9_ with respect to such matter),
as Buyer may reasonably request to more effectively convey and transfer to
Buyer any of the Purchased Assets or Purchased Shares or otherwise carry out
the intent of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and effect
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (B) Buyer will execute
and deliver such instruments, certificates, agreements and other documents and
perform such other actions, at Sellers sole expense (unless such action
is otherwise expressly contemplated to be performed by (or caused to be
performed by) Buyer by this Agreement or another Transaction Document to the
extent or any Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under
_Article 9_ with respect to such matter), as Seller or its Subsidiaries may
reasonably request to more effectively assume the Assumed Liabilities or
otherwise carry out the intent of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and effect the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) neither Buyer nor Seller will be required
to make any payments, incur any Liability, or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with obtaining any
Consent of any Person and (y) Buyers and Sellers obligations in respect of
divestitures and other restraints on freedom of business conduct are addressed
by _Section 6.3_ and not this  _Section 6.11_.

(b) _Payments_. In the event that, on or after the Closing, either Party
receives payments or funds due or belonging to the other Party pursuant to
the terms hereof or any of the Transaction Documents, then the Party receiving
such payments or funds shall promptly forward or cause to be promptly
forwarded such payments or funds to the proper party (with appropriate
endorsements, as applicable), and will account to such other Party for all
such receipts. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, there is no right of offset regarding such
payments and a Party may not withhold funds received from third parties for
the account of the other Party in the event there is a dispute regarding any
other issue under this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents. Without
limiting the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.11(b)_, Seller agrees
that Buyer shall, following the Closing, have the right and authority to
endorse any checks or drafts received by Buyer in respect of any account
receivable of the Business included in the Purchased Assets or reflected in
the Final Closing Net Working Capital and Seller shall furnish Buyer such
evidence of this authority as Buyer may reasonably request. Following the
Closing, if Buyer (or its Subsidiaries) receives any mail or 

 



119  packages addressed to Seller or its Subsidiaries and delivered to Buyer not
relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Purchased Shares or the
Assumed Liabilities, Buyer shall promptly deliver such mail or packages to
Seller. Following the Closing, if Seller (or its Subsidiaries) receives any
mail or packages delivered to Seller relating to the Business, the Purchased
Assets, the Purchased Shares or the Assumed Liabilities, Seller shall
promptly deliver such mail or packages to Buyer.

(c) _Intellectual Property Rights_.

 

(i) In the event that on or prior to the 15 month anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer gives written notice to Seller that it has identified any
Intellectual Property Rights owned by Seller or its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time that was not included in the
Transferred Intellectual Property Rights as of the Effective Time, and such
IPR is primarily related to the Business as conducted on the Closing Date (as
opposed to being primarily related to any other business or businesses of
Seller other than the Business) (" _After-Identified IPR_ "), then (x) Seller
will (or will cause its Subsidiaries to) execute and deliver such documents
and perform such other actions as are necessary to convey and transfer to
Buyer (or an Other Buyer) all of Sellers (or its Subsidiaries) right, title
and interest to such After-Identified IPR and (y) such After-Identified IPR
will constitute Transferred Intellectual Property for all purposes under this
Agreement and the IPMA (including without limitation the license grants from
Buyer and its Affiliates in Article 4 thereof).

(ii) In the event that on or prior to the 15 month anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer gives written notice to Seller that it has identified any
Technology owned by Seller or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time that was not included in the Transferred Technology as of the
Effective Time and is not Excluded Software, but was (i) included in,
embedded in, bundled with, or distributed with any Products, (ii) used in the
design, development, making, manufacture, use, importation, distribution,
installation, provision, licensing, sale, offering for sale, maintenance, or
support of any Products, or (iii) used in connection with the operation of the
Business as conducted on the Closing Date (" _After-Identified Common
Software_ "), then (a) if such After-Identified Common Software is primarily
related to the Business (as opposed to being primarily related to any other
business or businesses of Seller other than the Business), Seller will (or
will cause its Subsidiaries to) execute and deliver such documents
and perform such other actions as are necessary to convey and transfer to
Buyer (or an Other Buyer) all of Sellers (or its Subsidiaries) right, title
and interest to such After-Identified Common Software and such After-
Identified Common Software will constitute Transferred Technology for all
purposes under this Agreement and the IPMA and will be deemed added to Exhibit
E-4 and licensed to Seller under the applicable provisions of Section 4.1(b)
of the IPMA and (b) if such After-Identified Common Software is not primarily
related to the Business, such After-Identified Software will be deemed to be
added to the lists of Common Licensed Software in Exhibit E-1, E-2, or E-3 of
the IPMA, as appropriate, and will be deemed licensed to Buyer under the
applicable provisions of Section 4.1(b) of the IPMA.

(iii) In the event that on or prior to the 15 month anniversary of the
Closing Date, Seller gives written notice to Buyer that it has identified any
Technology included in the Transferred Technology that was not identified in
Exhibit E-4 of the IPMA but was as of the Closing Date (i) included in,
embedded in, bundled with, or distributed with any Seller products (other than
Products) or (ii) used in the design, development, making, manufacture, use,
importation, distribution, installation, provision, licensing, sale, offering
for sale, maintenance, or support of any Seller products (other than
Products) (" _After-Identified E-4 Software_ "), then such After-Identified
E-4 Software will be deemed added to Exhibit E-4 of the IPMA and licensed back
to Seller under the applicable provisions of Section 4.1(b) of the IPMA.

(iv) Any dispute between Buyer and Seller regarding whether a particular item
of IPR constitutes an After-Identified IPR or whether a particular piece of
Common Licensed Software

 



120  constitutes After-Identified Common Software or After-Identified E-4
Software will be resolved pursuant to _Section 11.9_ hereof. For clarity,
this subsection (c) (and not subsection (a) above) will control on the topics
addressed in this subsection (c).

(d) _Real Property_. At the reasonable request of Buyer, Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to facilitate the lease agreements of Seller
or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for the Business Real Properties located
in each of (i) Culver City, California, (ii) Dallas, Texas, (iii) Heathrow,
Florida and (iv) Southfield, Minnesota (collectively, the " _Applicable IM
Business Property_ "), to be assigned directly to a Purchased Entity or
replaced by a new lease agreement between a Purchased Entity and the landlord
to such Applicable IM Business Property on terms satisfactory to Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall require Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay any amount, grant or alter any rights or contractual
provisions, grant any guarantee or offer or grant any accommodation (financial
or otherwise) to the landlord or any other third party or incur additional
costs or expenses in order to obtain any necessary Consent for such assignment
or new lease agreement, other than general reasonable internal costs,
overhead and reasonable use of internal personnel and assets or
infrastructure; _provided_ that any resulting breakage fee or other costs
incurred by Seller as a result of obtaining such Consent shall be paid by
Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the failure to obtain such
Consent to assign or replace the lease agreements under any Applicable IM
Business Property be taken into consideration for determining whether
_Section 7.3(e)_ has been satisfied nor will such failure be deemed to be a
breach of Section 2 (Facilities Separation).

 

 _Section 6.12_ _Privileges_. The Parties agree that their respective rights
and obligations to maintain, preserve, assert, or waive any attorney-client
and work product privileges belonging to either Party with respect to the
Business and the other businesses of Seller (collectively, " _Privileges_ "),
shall be governed by the provisions of this  _Section 6.12_. With respect to
all business records, documents, communications, or other information
(collectively, " _Information_ ") of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to Sellers businesses, the Excluded Assets or the Excluded
Liabilities, in each case to the extent either such Information does not also
relate to the Business, the Purchased Assets, or the Assumed Liabilities or,
until such time as the Excluded Pending Litigation is finally resolved, such
Information relates to the Excluded Pending Litigation, Seller shall have sole
authority to determine whether to assert or waive any Privileges, including
(other than with respect to Information relating to the Excluded
Pending Litigation) the right to assert any Privilege against Buyer and its
Affiliates. Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including, as of the Closing Date, the
Purchased Entities) shall take no action after the Closing without the prior
written consent of Seller that would reasonably be expected to result in any
waiver of any such Privileges of Seller. After the Closing, Buyer shall have
sole authority to determine whether to assert or waive any Privileges with
respect to matters relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the
Purchased Shares and the Assumed Liabilities (but not including Information
prepared by Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby or any other potential transaction relating to sale, spin-off or
divestiture of the Business or related sale process, or matters to the extent
that they relate to the Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities or the
businesses of Seller (other than the Business)). However, Buyer may not
assert any such Privileges of the Purchased Entities, Seller or its
Subsidiaries related to pre-Closing advice or communications relating to the
Business against Seller and its Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , that,
if the waiver (or failure to assert) such Privilege, would reasonably be
expected to result in such Privilege being waived in connection with any claim
by a third party, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter
into such reasonable arrangements as are reasonably necessary to ensure that
such Privilege is not otherwise waived with respect to a third party,
including customary joint defense agreements or similar arrangements.
Seller and its Affiliates shall take no action after the Closing without the
prior written consent of Buyer that would reasonably be expected to result in
any waiver of any such Privileges of Buyer. The rights and obligations created
by this  _Section 6.12_ shall apply to all applicable Information as to
which Seller, its Affiliates or the Purchased Entities would be entitled to

 



121  assert or has asserted a Privilege without regard to the effect, if any, of
the transactions contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction Documents
(the " _Privileged Information_ "). Following the Closing, upon receipt by
Seller or its Subsidiaries, or Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including, as of
the Closing Date, the Purchased Entities), as the case may be, of any
subpoena, discovery or other request from any third party that actually or
arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged Information of
the other or if Seller or its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries
(including, as of the Closing Date, the Purchased Entities), as the case may
be, obtains knowledge that any current or former employee of Seller, its
Subsidiaries or the Purchased Entities or Buyer or its Subsidiaries
(including, as of the Closing Date, the Purchased Entities), has received any
subpoena, discovery or other request from any third party that actually or
arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged Information of
the other Party, such Party shall promptly notify the other of the existence
of the request and shall provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review
the Information and to assert any rights it may have under this _Section
6.12_ or otherwise to prevent the production or disclosure of Privileged
Information. Sellers transfer of any Business Records or other Information
to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and Sellers and Buyers agreement
to permit the other to obtain information existing prior to the Closing are
made in reliance on the Parties respective agreements, as set forth in this
_Section 6.12_ and _Section 6.2_, to maintain the confidentiality of
information and to take the steps provided herein for the preservation of all
Privileges that may belong to or be asserted by Seller or Buyer, as the case
may be. The access to Business Records and other information being granted
pursuant to _Section 6.2_, _Section 6.3_, _Section 6.5_, _Section 6.8_, 
_Section 9.3_ or the other provisions hereof, and the disclosure to Buyer and
Seller of Privileged Information relating to the Business or the other
businesses of Seller pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or any other Transaction Document shall not
be asserted by Seller or Buyer to constitute, or otherwise be deemed, a waiver
of any Privilege that has been or may be asserted under this _Section 6.12_
or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties (or their Affiliates)
have previously entered into that certain Common Interest Agreement, dated
June 23, 2015, as well as that certain Common Interest Agreement, dated July
28, 2015, and that certain "Privileged Materials" (as defined therein) may
constitute Purchased Assets hereunder and to the extent they do, then nothing
therein or herein shall be deemed to limit Buyers (or any of its Affiliates)
use, disclosure or other exercise of its ownership rights over such
Privileged Materials following the Closing, or otherwise impose any obligation
on Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) following the Closing with respect to such
Privileged Materials (including, without limitation, providing notices to
Seller prior to any use or disclosure thereof), in each case, following the
Closing, and, with respect to such materials so acquired, Buyer (or its
applicable Affiliates) shall be deemed the disclosing or originating Party
with respect thereto (and deemed to have prepared such materials as the
successor of the Business) and the Seller shall be deemed the receiving Party
with respect thereto, and such Common Interest Agreement shall be deemed
amended (or the terms therein waived) to the extent necessary to effect the
foregoing agreements. Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. is an express
intended beneficiary of, with rights to enforce, the provisions set forth in
the preceding sentence, and Buyer shall be deemed a party to such Common
Interest Agreements to the extent necessary to effect the foregoing
agreements.

_Section 6.13_  _Use of Seller Names and Marks_. Seller and its Subsidiaries
will grant to Buyer rights to use certain trademarks that are not included in
the Transferred Intellectual Property Rights, as defined in, during the term
of, and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the IPMA.
Except as expressly provided in the IPMA, Seller reserves for itself and its
Affiliates all rights in any Seller trademarks that are not included in the
Transferred Intellectual Property Rights, and no other rights therein are
granted to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, whether by implication, estoppel or
otherwise.

 



122 _Section 6.14_ _Delivery of Business Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and deliver to
Buyer unaudited combined balance sheets for the Business and the related
combined statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and invested
equity for the three month period ended June 27, 2014, and three month and six
month periods ended October 3, 2014 and three month and nine month
periods ended January 2, 2015 (the " _2015 Quarterly Statements_ "), in each
case, reviewed by the Businesss independent auditors in accordance with
AICPA-AU 930, at or prior to the Closing, unless the 2015
Quarterly Statements have been delivered to Buyer prior to the Closing Date
as Required Financing Information. The 2015 Quarterly Statements shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and in a manner
consistent with the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements.

(b) If prior to August 15, 2015, Buyer informs Seller that Buyer in good faith
intends to commence distribution of an offering memorandum, confidential
information memorandum and lender presentation or similar disclosure document
incorporating the Required Financing Information prior to November 1, 2015,
then Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer (i)
unaudited financial statements of the Business for the three month periods
ended July 3, 2015 and June 27, 2014 (consisting of an unaudited balance sheet
as of July 3, 2015 and an unaudited statement of income, comprehensive
income, cash flows and invested equity for the fiscal quarter ended on such
dates), in each case, prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
and in a manner consistent with the preparation of the Audited Financial
Statements and reviewed by the Businesss independent auditors in accordance
with AICPA-AU 930, and (ii) a customary "MDandA," which shall compare the three
month period ended July 3, 2015 to the three month period ended June 27, 2014
and be prepared in a manner consistent with the "MDandA" required to be
delivered under the definition of "Required Financing Information", in each
case, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, unless
such financial statements and MDandA have been delivered to Buyer prior to the
Closing Date as Required Financing Information. To the extent the Closing Date
has not occurred on or prior to November 16, 2015, Seller shall use its
reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer (i) unaudited financial statements of
the Business for the six month and three month periods ended October 2, 2015
and October 5, 2014 (consisting of an unaudited balance sheet as of October

 _Section 6.15_ _Buyer Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, the Financing on the terms, and
conditions, described in the Financing Commitments, including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly negotiate definitive agreements on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment (including
any market flex provisions) or on the terms that, taken as a whole, are no
less favorable to Buyer than the terms contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment (including any "flex" provisions applicable thereto), in each case
which terms shall not in any respect (A) expand on or modify in any manner
(other than by a waiver of) the conditions to the funding of the Financing at
the Closing without the consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), or (B) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing available to be funded on the Closing Date (or in the event the
Closing Date is January 1, 2016, then to be funded on January 4, 2016) unless
such amount is replaced with an amount of new equity

 



125  financing on conditions no less favorable to Seller than the terms set forth
in the Financing Commitments for the Equity Financing included in the
Financing as of the Agreement Date (the " _Financing Agreements_ "), (ii)
satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on a timely basis or cause the satisfaction
(or waiver) on a timely basis of all conditions in the Financing Commitments
and the Financing Agreements applicable to Buyer that are to be satisfied by
Buyer to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, (iii) consummate
the Financing on or prior to the date on which the Closing is required to
occur pursuant to _Section 8.1_, (iv) enforce its rights under the Financing
Commitments and Financing Agreements, including through litigation pursued in
good faith and (v) comply with its obligations under the Financing
Commitments. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
if (x) all or a portion of the Debt Financing structured as high yield debt or
contemplated to be sold pursuant to a Rule 144A transaction has not been
issued or sold on or prior to the Closing Date, (y) all conditions precedent
to Buyers obligations hereunder shall have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing)
and (z) the bridge financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment is
available, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the proceeds
of the bridge financing to finance, in part, the Required Amount to allow the
Closing to occur when it would be scheduled to occur pursuant to
_Section 8.1_.

(b) In the event that, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by
Buyer to satisfy its obligations under  _Section 6.15(a)_, any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
any market flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments
(unless such portion is not reasonably required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), Buyer shall promptly notify
Seller (and in any event, within two Business Days after Buyer becomes so
aware) thereof and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative
financing on terms that are not materially less favorable to Buyer than the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (including any
"flex" provisions applicable thereto) and/or Financing Agreements, as
applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay, when added to the Buyer Equity
Financing and to the portion of the Debt Financing that is available, the
Required Amount as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence
of such event but no later than the Business Day following the final day of
the Marketing Period; _provided_ that such alternative financing shall not
have any of the effects described in clauses (A) through (E) of clause (c)(i)
below. Buyer shall deliver to Seller true and complete copies of the new
financing commitment and related fee letter, and any related Contracts
(redacted in the manner described in _Section 5.5(b)_) pursuant to which any
such alternative source shall have committed to provide Buyer with any
portion of the Debt Financing substantially concurrently with the execution
thereof.

(c) Buyer shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Financing Commitments or the Financing Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) without the prior written consent of Seller, no such amendment,
replacement, supplement, modification or waiver shall (A) reduce (or have the
effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount in respect
of the Debt Financing (except as set forth in any flex provisions existing on
the Agreement Date)), (B) add conditions precedent to the Financing or amend,
replace, supplement or modify any existing conditions precedent to the
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
delay or make the funding of the Financing less likely to occur (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing), (C) be reasonably expected
to prevent, impede or materially delay the availability of the Financing, or
(D) adversely affect the ability of Buyer to enforce or cause the enforcement
of its rights under the Financing Commitments or the Financing Agreements; and
(ii) it is understood and agreed that Buyer may amend the Debt Financing
Commitment to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the
Agreement Date and amend titles, allocations and the fee arrangements with
respect to the existing and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
agents, managers or similar entities.

 



126 (d) To the extent Buyer obtains alternative financing pursuant to _Section
6.15(b)_, or amends, replaces, supplements, modifies or waives any of the
Financing pursuant to _Section 6.15(c)_, references to the "Financing" and
"Financing Commitments" (and other like terms in this Agreement) shall be
deemed to refer to such alternative financing, or the Financing as so
amended, replaced, supplemented, modified or waived.

(e) Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed on a reasonably timely basis
of the status of the Financing and any material developments in connection
with Buyers efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer shall notify Seller promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days) if at any time prior to the Closing Date: (i) the Financing
Commitments expire or are terminated for any reason, (ii) Buyer obtains
knowledge of any material breach or default by any party to the Financing
Commitments and/or the Financing Agreements if such breach or default could
reasonably be expected to affect the timely availability of, or the amount of,
the Financing by any party to any Financing Commitment, (iii) Buyer receives
any written communication from any Person providing a Financing Commitment
with respect to any (A) actual, potential or threatened breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Commitments with
respect to a material provision of the Financing Commitments or (B) a material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing
Commitments with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount
of the Financing to be funded at Closing, in each case, that could reasonably
be expected to affect the timely availability of, or the amount of, the
Financing or (iv) any other event or development occurs that Buyer expects to
have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Buyer to obtain all or
any material portion of the Financings contemplated by the Financing
Commitments on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by
the Financing Commitment or the definitive documents related to the Debt
Financing or Buyer, for any reason, otherwise no longer believes in good faith
that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms described in the Financing Commitments; _provided_  that,
notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event will Buyer be under
any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client
or similar privilege if Buyer shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege (in
which case Buyer shall inform Seller as to the general nature of what is being
withheld as a result of such privilege). As soon as reasonably practicable
(but in any event within two Business Days after the date Seller delivers to
Buyer a written request therefor), Buyer shall provide any information
reasonably requested by Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in
clause (i) through (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence.

(f) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives to use reasonable best
efforts to provide such reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing (which shall be deemed to include any
offering of debt securities that Buyer may elect to pursue to finance the
transactions contemplated hereby) as may be reasonably requested by Buyer,
including its reasonable best efforts to (i) participate (and use reasonable
best efforts to cause members of senior management of Seller and/or the
Business to participate), to the extent customary and reasonable and not
unreasonably interfering with the Business or the business of Seller, in
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and drafting
sessions with the Debt Financing Sources and actual and prospective lenders,
financing sources and investors and sessions with rating agencies (including
customary one-on-one meetings with parties acting as lead arrangers or
prospective "anchor" lenders and investors), (ii) furnish Buyer and the Debt
Financing Sources with Required Financing Information, and identify any such
Required Financing Information as suitable for distribution to "public side"
lenders, (iii) assist Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources in the preparation

memorandum for any portion of the Debt Financing (and furnishing customary
authorization letters (containing customary representations, including the
customary representation that the information provided by Seller for inclusion
in any confidential information memorandum or lender presentation does not
include material

 



127  non-public information about Seller and its Subsidiaries, and designating
the information provided by Seller for presentation to the Financing Sources
as suitable to be made available to lenders who do not wish to receive
material non-public information) in connection therewith, executed on behalf
of Seller), (B) materials for rating agency presentations and (C) bank

extent customary and reasonable and not unreasonably interfering with the
Business or the business of Seller, (iv) provide reasonable and customary
cooperation with the marketing efforts of Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources
for any portion of the Debt Financing to the extent not unreasonably

pledge and security documents, any Financing Agreement and other definitive
financing documents (in each case, with respect to any such execution, solely
with respect to individuals who are expected to be Continuing Employees and
are executing such documentation on behalf of, and in the capacity as an
officer or director of, the legal entities constituting the Business and not,
for the avoidance of doubt, in his or her capacity as an officer of Seller,
with such documentation (other than with respect to the Officers
Certificate described below) effective with and subject to the occurrence of
the Closing), including an executed certificate of the Chief Financial Officer

financing documents that may form part of the Debt Financing and other
customary matters, secretarys certificates, closing certificates, notices and

Debt Financing Commitments (including providing copies thereof prior to the
Closing Date) on or prior to the Closing Date) and taking reasonable steps
necessary to permit the Debt Financing Sources to evaluate the Purchased
Assets, the assets of the Purchased Entities for purposes of establishing

until the Closing and the delivery of any such original stock certificates and
other certificated securities and original stock powers shall be delivered in
escrow pending release at Closing, (vii) furnish Buyer and the Debt Financing
Sources at least four Business Days prior to the Closing Date all

128  requires the cooperation, and is within the control, of any Seller, its
Subsidiaries or their respective representatives, to the extent such
cooperation is reasonable and does not unreasonably interfere with the
Business; _provided_ that (x) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries

request of Seller, all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by
Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of Seller

Financing Information _; provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall bear all
such costs related to its obligations with respect to the preparation,
review, delivery and audit of historical financial statements, consisting of

Buyer shall, and hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and
all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith,
except in the event such Losses arose out of or resulted from (x) the willful
misconduct of Seller or its Affiliates or their Representatives or (y)
information provided by (or authorized by Seller to be provided by) Seller or
its Affiliates for use in or in connection with the Debt Financing (including
the historical financial information of the Business described in the proviso
of the immediately preceding sentence). Seller hereby consents to the
reasonable use of logos used in the Business in connection with the
Debt Financing or alternative financing, provided that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage Seller or any of its Affiliates or the reputation or goodwill of
Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of their logos and on such other
customary terms and conditions as Seller shall reasonably impose. All non-
public or other confidential information provided by Seller or its
representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential in

each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons
(i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto;
or (ii) are subject to customary confidentiality arrangements, or other
confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company, of which
the Company is a beneficiary.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to consummate the
Purchase Transaction or any other transactions contemplated hereby and by the
other Transaction Documents is not contingent upon Buyer obtaining the
Financing or any other third party financing, and Buyers failure to
consummate the Financing or alternative financing upon the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ shall constitute
a material breach by Buyer of this Agreement, enforceable subject to the
limitations set forth in  _Section 11.7_.

_Section 6.16_ _Transition Services_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in the Transition Services Agreement, the Retained Contracts Agreement, the
Buyer and Seller Reseller/OEM Agreements, the Product Purchase Agreements, the
Data Redirection Agreement or other Transaction

 



129  Document, all Shared Services provided to the Business by or on behalf of
Seller (regardless of whether such Shared Service was provided through
Purchased Entities, Purchased Assets or Continuing Employee) shall cease as
of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _that_ , in the event that prior to the
Closing, Buyer identifies any service material to the operation of the
Business that was provided to the Business by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly through third-party service
providers whose services are integrated with a Shared Service, that Buyer
reasonably believes is necessary for it and its Subsidiaries to operate the
Business following the Closing substantially as conducted during the 12-month
period prior to the Effective Time (and which service is not provided through
the Purchased Assets or Purchased Entities), Buyer and Seller shall add such
service to the Transition Services Agreement such that Seller or its
Subsidiaries will, subject to the terms and conditions of the Transition
Services Agreement generally applicable to other services thereunder, provide
(or arrange for the provision of) such service to Buyer and its Subsidiaries
at a cost to be mutually agreed and determined in a manner reasonably
consistent with the cost methodology used in the Transition Services Agreement
for other functionally or operationally similar services, which such service
shall continue (unless earlier terminated by Buyer) for a reasonable period
of time to allow Buyer or its Subsidiaries to provision such services or
procure substantially comparable services from a third party. Further, Buyer
shall, at its sole option, and upon written notice to Seller reasonably in
advance of Closing, have the right to elect to not receive one or more service
under the Transition Services Agreement and, in such event, the pricing under
the Transition Services Agreement shall be reduced accordingly prior to the
Closing.

_Section 6.17_ _Guarantees_. Buyer recognizes that Seller and certain of
its Subsidiaries have provided credit support to the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Purchased Entities pursuant to guarantees, letters of credit,
bonds, sureties and other credit support or assurances provided by Seller or
its Subsidiaries in support of any obligation of the Business (the "
_Business Guarantees_ "), each as set forth on _Schedule 6.17_ of the
Disclosure Letter, and that Seller may supplement _Schedule 6.17_ from time to
time prior to Closing to include any additional Business Guarantees entered
into after the Agreement Date in the ordinary course of business). Buyer and
Seller shall their reasonable best efforts to obtain from the respective
beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, on or
before the Closing Date, valid and binding written releases of Seller and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, from any Liability, whether arising before, on or
after the Closing Date, under any Business Guarantees listed on _Schedule
6.17_ of the Disclosure Letter (as supplemented prior to the Closing Date) to
the extent relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities (such Business Guarantees, the " _Scheduled Guarantees_ "), which
release shall be effective as of the Closing, including, in the case of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, by providing substitute guarantees,
furnishing letters of credit, instituting escrow agreements, posting surety
or performance bonds or making other arrangements as the beneficiary may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _that_ , in no event will Buyer be required
to provide any guarantee or other form of security (e.g., letters of
credit, instituting escrow agreements, posting surety or performance bonds)
of a materially different type or terms as the Business Guarantee being
released or terminated. If any Scheduled Guarantee has not been released as of
the Closing Date, then Buyer and Seller shall continue to use their
reasonable best efforts after the Closing to cause as promptly as practicable
the complete and unconditional release of Seller and its Subsidiaries under
such Business Guarantee to the extent relating to the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities (subject to the limitations set forth in the
preceding sentence). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date,
Seller and its Subsidiaries may, in such Persons sole discretion, take any
action to terminate, obtain release of or otherwise limit their Liability
under any and all outstanding Scheduled Guarantees. Buyer shall, and hereby
agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries from and
after the Closing for any amounts required to be paid under any Business
Guarantees to the extent relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities and arising out of or as a result of any act or omission
by Buyer or its Subsidiaries after the Closing.

and agree that all Intercompany Agreements, and all rights and obligations of

to the Closing. No such terminated Intercompany Agreement or any arrangement,
commitment or understanding relating thereto (including any provision thereof
that purports to survive termination) shall be of any further force or effect

series of related matters that are less than the Minimum Amount) in excess of
the Deductible.

other Closing Transfer Document shall survive the Closing until the date that
is 15 months after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding

specified therein; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the obligations of Buyer with respect to Assumed Liabilities (other
than the indemnification obligations with respect to Liabilities pursuant to
_Section 6.8(a)(ii)_), and the obligations of Seller with respect to
Excluded Liabilities (other than the indemnification obligations with respect
to Excluded Tax Liabilities pursuant to _Section 6.8(a)(i)_), shall survive
the Closing for an indefinite period; _provided_ further that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the indemnification obligations with respect
to Excluded Tax Liabilities pursuant to _Section 6.8(a)(i)_ and Liabilities
pursuant to _Section 6.8(a)(ii)_ shall survive the Closing Date until the
date that is 30 days following the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of
limitations. The Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to any claim
that any Party may have against any other Party that is permitted pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the survival periods set forth and agreed to in
this _Section 9.2(c)_ shall govern when any such claim may be brought and
shall replace and supersede any statute of limitations that may otherwise
be applicable. Buyer shall not bring any claim pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)(i)_ for a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
_Section 4.12(q)_ prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

(d) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a Party pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)(i)_ and _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_,  _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ and
_Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall terminate upon the expiration of the applicable
survival period specified in _Section 9.2(c)_ above; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any matter as to which a Notifying Party has asserted a claim for
indemnity in compliance with this _Article 9_ during such survival period
which is pending or unresolved at the end of such survival period shall
continue to be covered by this _Article 9_ until such matter is finally
terminated or otherwise resolved by the Parties or by a court of competent
jurisdiction and any amounts payable hereunder are finally determined and
paid.

 

(e) With respect to each representation or warranty that is limited by
"materially," "material," "Material Adverse Effect,", "material adverse
effect", "in all material respects" or other similar qualification (other than
a Specified Qualification) (such representations and warranties, the "
_Qualified Representations_ "), such qualification will be disregarded for
the purpose of determining

 



139  whether an inaccuracy or breach of any such representation or warranty has
occurred and the amount of any Loss that is the subject of indemnification
hereunder. With respect to each representation or warranty that is subject to
a Specified Qualification, such qualification will be disregarded for the
purpose of determining the amount of any Loss that is the subject of
indemnification hereunder, but not for the purpose of determining whether
there was a breach of such representation or warranty.

(f) The Indemnified Parties shall exercise all commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate the amount of any Losses after becoming aware of any event
or matter which could reasonably be likely to result in Losses; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Parties shall not be required to
mitigate any Losses if such mitigation or efforts would reasonably be
expected to be materially detrimental to its business, reputation or future
business prospects. Further, the failure to mitigate if required hereby shall
not result in the loss of any indemnification rights but the amount of
otherwise indemnifiable Losses resulting from such matter will be reduced by
the amount thereof that would have been prevented had such mitigation
occurred.

 

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, Losses shall be calculated net of any
amounts actually recovered under insurance policies and
contractual indemnification or contribution provisions in each case with
third parties (in each case, calculated net of reasonable expenses incurred in
procuring such recovery and, with respect to recoveries from insurance, any
increase in premiums or retroactive premium adjustments or chargebacks paid
by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party as a result of the insurance claim
related to such Loss, and taking into account the available coverage under the
relevant insurance policy, it being understood that such coverage shall first
be available to satisfy other claims pending under such policy at the time
claim related to such Loss is made). The Indemnified Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain recovery of any Losses
under any available insurance policies that may extend to such Losses or
pursuant to a claim against any third party for indemnification or
contribution under any applicable Contract, except, in each case, to the
extent that such efforts or recovery would reasonably be expected to be
materially detrimental to its business, reputation or future business
prospects. Further, nothing in this Agreement shall (i) require any
Indemnified Party to continue or maintain in effect any insurance policies or
(ii) prevent or delay any Person from obtaining any indemnification hereunder
prior to recovery of any amounts from any Potential Contributor or any Tax
Benefit or using any efforts to obtain any such recovery or Tax Benefit;
_however_ , if the amount to be netted hereunder in connection with a
Potential Contributor from any payment required pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_
or _Section 9.1(b)_ is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party of
any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section 9.1(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall repay to
the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that
the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_
or _Section 9.1(b)_ had such determination been made at the time of such
payment.

 

(h) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party
in respect of any Losses pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section 9.1(b)_
as the case may be and the Indemnified Party would have recovered all or a
part of such Losses from a third party (including any third party insurance
company) (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim
asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall, to the
extent permitted by Law and any pertinent Contract, assign such of its rights
to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the
Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to
assign any right to proceed against a Potential Contributor if such
assignment would reasonably be expected to be materially detrimental to its
business, reputation or future business prospects. Except as set forth in this
_Section 9.2(h)_, the Indemnifying Parties waive all rights of subrogation
with respect to any indemnification payments made by them and shall not be
entitled to any rights of subrogation with respect to claims indemnified by
them.

 



140 (i) To the extent an Indemnified Party actually realizes any Tax Benefits as a
result of any Losses for the taxable year in which the indemnity payment is
made or in the subsequent tax year, the Indemnified Party shall pay the amount
of such Tax Benefits (net of any Taxes imposed in respect thereof and any
reasonable costs of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates attributable to
or incurred to recover such Tax Benefit) to the Indemnifying Party by (i)
reducing the amount of Losses by the amount of Tax Benefits (net of any Taxes
imposed in respect thereof and any reasonable costs of the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates attributable to or incurred to recover such Tax Benefit)
realized (if such benefits are actually realized prior to the date on which
the indemnity payment is made) or (ii) making a payment to the Indemnifying
Party in an amount equal to the Tax Benefit (net of any Taxes imposed in
respect thereof and any reasonable costs of the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates attributable to or incurred to recover such Tax Benefit) within 20
Business Days after such benefit is realized if such benefit is actually
realized after the indemnity payment is made. For this purpose, an Indemnified
Party shall be deemed to actually realize a tax benefit (" _Tax Benefit_ ")
if, and to the extent that, such Indemnified Partys actual Liability for
Taxes (after giving effect to any alternative minimum or similar Tax),
calculated including the Tax items attributed to the underlying Losses,
is lower (by way of a reduction of Taxes paid or increase in a refund of
Taxes actually received or applied against other Taxes due) than it would have
been had such Liability for Taxes been calculated excluding such Tax items,
determined on a "with and without basis". Nothing in this Agreement shall
require any Indemnified Party to claim or utilize any deduction, loss or other
Tax benefit unless the Indemnifying Party delivers, from a mutually agreeable
independent accounting firm, an opinion, or an informal advice memorandum
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, that such position "should"
prevail under applicable Tax Law. The cost of the "should" opinion is to be
borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller.

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no
event will any Buyer Indemnified Party have any right to indemnification (and
Buyer Losses shall not be deemed to have been incurred) with respect to any
matter to the extent that such matter is accrued or reflected or otherwise
taken into account in the calculation of the Final Closing Net Working
Capital or to the extent the Purchase Price has been adjusted for such matter
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

 _Section 9.3_ _Indemnification Procedures, Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) _General Claim Procedure_. Except with respect to Tax Claims which are
addressed in _Section 6.8_, in respect of any claim regarding
indemnification for any Loss or Liability under this Agreement, the Party
making such claim shall have the burden of proof that such Party is entitled
to such indemnification. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a
claim against any Indemnifying Party for indemnification of Losses hereunder,
the Notifying Party shall deliver a notice of such claim to the Indemnifying
Party within 20 Business Days of becoming aware of the facts underlying such
claim, stating in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such claim
(including, to the extent such claim relates to a Third Party Claim,
reasonable details of each claim made by the relevant third party in
connection with such Third Party Claim and the provision of copies of the
relevant material documents received by the Indemnified Party evidencing such
Third Party Claim), the amount of the claim, the basis for the indemnification
sought, and all material documents reflecting or evidencing the basis for such
claim (in each case, to the extent then known and in the control of the
Notifying Party); _provided_ , _that_ , the failure to provide any such
notice, information or documents will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party or Notifying Party
for indemnification of Losses hereunder, except to the extent that the defense
of such action is actually and materially prejudiced thereby or to the extent
that the amount of Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible is
increased thereby.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Notifying Party that it does
not dispute the claim described in such notice, or fails to notify the
Notifying Party within 30 Business Days after delivery of such notice by the
Notifying Party whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim 

 



141  described in such notice, the Loss in the amount specified in the Notifying
Partys notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying
Party and, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article 9_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party
on demand. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its Liability with
respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Notifying Party shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation
subject to _Section 11.9_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any such Loss
no later than 10 Business Days following the determination of the Indemnifying
Partys Liability (whether such determination is made pursuant to
the procedures set forth in this _Section 9.3_, by written agreement between
the Indemnifying Party and the Notifying Party or by final adjudication
subject to _Section 11.9_).

 

(c) _Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) Within 10 Business Days after the receipt by any Indemnified Party of a
notice of any claim by any third party, or any Proceeding by any third party,
that may be subject to indemnification under this _Article 9_ (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), including any claim or Proceeding relating to any Excluded
Liability or any Assumed Liability, the Notifying Party shall give written
notice of such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with
_Section 9.3(a)_ above (the " _Third Party Claim Notice_ "). Thereafter, the
Notifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after any
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all material notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party, or filed
or published, relating to the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the failure to provide any Third Party Claim Notice or
such other notices or documents described herein will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party
or Notifying Party for indemnification of Losses hereunder, except to the
extent that the defense of such action is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby or to the extent that the amount of Losses for which the
Indemnifying Party is responsible is increased thereby. The Parties agree
that all Excluded Pending Litigation and Assumed Pending Litigation constitute
Third Party Claims and will be subject to the provisions of this _Section
9.3(c)_ following the Closing, but, for the avoidance of doubt, no Third
Party Claim Notice need be given.

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof. In
addition, the Indemnifying Party may elect (by written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 45 Business Days after the Indemnifying Party
receives notice of such claim, or at any time thereafter if a diligent and
good faith defense of such claim is not being, or ceases to be, conducted by
the Indemnified Party and such conduct is not remedied within 10 Business Days
after notice in writing to the Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party)
to assume and control the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; _provided_
, _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall only be entitled to direct the defense (A) for so long as the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense in an active and diligent manner, (B)
if the Third-Party Claim is not in respect of any matter involving potential
criminal liability and does not seek as a remedy the imposition of an
equitable remedy that, if granted, would be binding upon the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates, (C) if the Third-Party Claim is in respect of an
indemnification claim by any Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ (with respect to a breach of _Section
6.1_ (other than with respect to knowing and intentional breaches of such
_Section 6.1_)) or any Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)(i)_ and such Third-Party Claim is not reasonably expected to result in
Losses in excess of the Cap, and (D) with 

 



142  respect to any matter if the Indemnified Party shall not have been advised
by outside counsel that there would be an actual conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to such matter.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof for so long as it continues to direct such defense.
If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ, at
its own expense, counsel separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall
control such defense and shall be empowered to make any settlement with
respect to such Third Party Claim, subject to the terms of this _Section
9.3(c)_. If and solely to the extent that the underlying Third Party Claim is
determined to be indemnifiable hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party in defense of such Third
Party Claim for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed
the defense thereof or following its loss of the ability to the direct the
defense as set forth herein.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim if the Indemnified
Party is the only Person with actual or potential liability with respect to
the Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives any rights
it may have to indemnification under this _Article 9_ with respect to such
Third Party Claim.

(iv) All the Parties hereto shall cooperate reasonably, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to cooperate reasonably, in the defense or prosecution (or
settlement) of any Third Party Claim against any of them. Such cooperation
shall include using commercially reasonable efforts in the retention and
(upon the reasonable request of an Indemnifying Party or other Party involved
in such claim) the provision of documents, records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim upon reasonable request therefor
(subject to the receiving Partys agreement to appropriate provisions for
maintaining confidentiality and privilege in a manner consistent with _Section
6.2_ and _Section 6.12_), and making employees available on any basis
reasonably requested by such Party to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder or otherwise relating to the
Third Party Claim.

 

(v) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any Liability with respect to,
or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle the same;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall give the
Indemnified Party advance notice of any proposed compromise or settlement and
in no event shall the Indemnifying Party compromise or settle any Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless such compromise or
settlement (i) provides for no relief other than the payment of monetary
damages borne solely by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) does not include any
admission of wrongdoing or violation of Law on the part of the Indemnified
Party or its Subsidiaries and (iii) includes as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the third-party claimant to the Indemnified Party of an
unconditional release from all liability or obligation in respect thereof. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation or
right to obtain any settlement, compromise, discharge or release with respect
to any portion of a Third Party Claim that is not indemnifiable by the
Indemnifying Party hereunder.

 



143 (vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this 
_Section 9.3_ shall not apply to any claim with respect to Taxes, which shall
be governed solely by _Section 6.8_.

 

(vii) In the case of any Third Party Claims where the Indemnifying Party
reasonably believes that it would be appropriate to settle such claim using
equitable remedies (i.e., remedies involving the future activity and conduct
of the Business), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall work
together in good faith to agree to a settlement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that no Party shall be under any obligation to agree to any such settlement.

_Section 9.4_ _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any payment made
pursuant to the indemnification obligations arising under this Agreement shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.

 

 _Section 9.5_ _Remedies Exclusive_. Following the Closing, with the
exception of (a) the matters covered by  _Section 3.5_, _Section 3.6_ and
_Section 6.8_, and (b) remedies awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction
based on a judgment that Seller or Buyer committed actual fraud with scienter,
the indemnification rights and associated time and dollar liability limits
set forth in this _Article 9_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
for money damages and shall be in lieu of any other remedies for money damages
that may be available to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to any statutory or
common Law (including Environmental Law), whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise, with respect to any Losses, Liabilities or Proceedings (including,
without limitation, reasonable legal, expert and consultant fees and
expenses) of any kind or nature incurred directly or indirectly resulting from
or arising out of, under or with respect to any of this Agreement (including
certificates delivered pursuant to _Article 7_ ) or the Closing Transfer
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (it being
understood that nothing in this _Section 9.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall affect the Parties rights to specific performance, injunctive relief
or other similar non-monetary equitable remedies with respect to the covenants
referred to in this Agreement to be performed at or after the Closing); for
clarity, this _Section 9.5_ shall not limit the rights and remedies of
the Parties under any of the other Signing Date Agreements (other than this
Agreement) or the Transaction Documents (other than the Closing Transfer
Documents), _provided_ that _Section 9.2(f)_, _Section 9.2(g)_,  _Section
9.2(h)_ and _Section 9.2(i)_ shall apply to any indemnification rights
available under any of the other Signing Date Agreements and _Section 6.8_.
Seller and Buyer each hereby waive any provision of any applicable Law to the
extent that it would limit or restrict the agreement contained in this
_Section 9.5_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, if the Closing occurs,
then Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries (including, from and
after the Closing (or Delayed Transfer Closing, as applicable, the Purchased
Entities) and its and their respective successors and assigns, hereby
acknowledges and agrees that Seller and its Subsidiaries shall have no
Liability (and hereby releases to the fullest extent permitted by Law Seller
and its Subsidiaries of, from and against any and all actions, causes of
action, claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits of every
kind, nature and description whatsoever, in law or in equity, which such
releasing Person ever had, now has or may in the future have on or by reason
of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever) with respect to the
Operational Separation Activities, other than the following: (x) for Buyer
Losses otherwise indemnifiable under _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, giving effect to the limitations set forth in this
_Article 9_ with respect to such indemnification obligations) arising out of
or as a result of the failure of any representation or warranty of Seller set
forth in _Section 4.4_, _Section 4.9_, _Section 4.12_ or _Section 4.13_ to
be true and correct as of the Closing Date (or Delayed Transfer Closing, as
applicable) (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such earlier date) and (y) for Buyer Losses otherwise
indemnifiable under  _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
giving effect to the limitations set forth in this _Article 9_ with respect
to such indemnification obligations) for any breach of the express provisions
of  _Section 2.7(a)_ or the first and third paragraphs of Section 1
(Structural Separation),

 



144  including the Step Plan, Section 2 (Facilities Separation) and Section 3
(Employee Separation) and any Defect Resolution Obligation, in each case of
_Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, all other sections (including, other than with respect to a Defect
Resolution Obligation, Section 4 (ERP System and IT Infrastructure
Separation)) of _Schedule 2.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter) (the " _Key
Separation Obligations_ "); _provided_ , _that_ , in no event shall the
foregoing limit (x) Sellers obligations, or any Buyer Indemnified Partys
rights to indemnification, with respect to Excluded Liabilities or (y)
Buyers rights to specific performance, injunctive relief or other similar
non-monetary equitable remedies with respect to the Key Separation
Obligations. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence (and without
limiting the rights of Buyer described therein), Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that the Operational Separation Activities have been, and will be, performed
on an "as is" basis without any warranties, express or implied (including any
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
title, enforceability or noninfringement).

 

 _Section 9.6_ _Exercise of Remedies by Persons Other than the Parties_. No
Buyer Indemnified Party (other than Buyer or any successor or assignee of
Buyer) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim under this Agreement
unless Buyer (or any successor or assignee of Buyer) consents to the assertion
of the indemnification claim. No Seller Indemnified Party (other than Seller
or any successor or assignee of Seller) is entitled to assert any
indemnification claim under this Agreement unless Seller (or any successor or
assignee of Seller) consents to the assertion of the indemnification claim.

 

 _Section 9.7_ _No Contribution_. In the case of an indemnification claim by
a Buyer Indemnified Party against Seller pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_,
Seller acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall have any right to indemnification or contribution from, or other right
or remedy against, the Purchased Entities or Purchased Minority Interests in
connection with such claim. However, for clarity, to the extent that the
matter underlying such Buyer Indemnified Partys indemnification claim would
also entitle a Seller Indemnified Party to indemnification against
Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its
assets and properties (including its ownership interests in the Purchased
Entities and Purchased Minority Interests) will be available to satisfy such
claim if it is resolved in favor of such Seller Indemnified Party.

ARTICLE 10

 

TERMINATION

 

 _Section 10.1_ _Termination Events_. This Agreement may be terminated and

duly authorized committee thereof) of each Party so determines;

(b) after February 29, 2016 (the " _Outside Date_ ") by any Party by notice to
the other Party if the Closing shall not have been occurred on or prior to
the Outside Date; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement has resulted in the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date; _provided_ , _further_
, neither Party shall have any right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 10.1(b)_ during the pendency of a Proceeding by the other
Party for specific performance to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (including to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 8.1_)
pursuant to _Section 11.7_ hereof;

 



145 (c) by either Party by notice to the other Party, if (i) a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final

case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Purchase Transaction or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to occur on the Closing Date; _provided_ that
neither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 10.1(c)(i)_ if such Partys failure to perform its obligations
under this Agreement has resulted in such order, decree or ruling or other
action or (ii) any U.S. federal or state Law has been enacted that would make
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal;

(d) by Seller, if there has been a breach of any representation or warranty
set forth in  _Article 5_ , or a breach or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in _Section
7.2(a)_ or  _Section 7.2(b)_ not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have
been cured within 20 Business Days (or by the Outside Date, if earlier)
following receipt by Buyer of written notice of such breach or failure to
perform from Seller;  _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 10.1(d)_ will not be available to Seller if the
Seller is then in breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement such that any condition set forth in
_Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ is incapable of being satisfied;

 

(e) by Buyer, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation or warranty set forth in _Article 4_ , or a breach or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ not to be satisfied, and
(ii) shall not have been cured within 20 Business Days (or by the Outside
Date, if earlier) following receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach
or failure to perform from Buyer; _provided_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(e)_ will not be available to
Buyer if Buyer is then in breach of any representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement such that any condition set
forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ is incapable of being
satisfied; or

(f) by Seller, if (i) Buyer shall have failed to consummate the Purchase
Transaction within two Business Days after the date on which the Closing
should have occurred pursuant to _Section 8.1_, (ii) all the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.1_ and  _Section 7.3_ would have been satisfied if the
Closing were to have occurred at such time (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing provided
such conditions would have been satisfied as of such date) and (iii) Seller
shall have given written notice to Buyer at least two Business Days prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(f)_ (which
notice may be given on the date the Closing should have occurred) that Seller
stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Purchase Transaction (subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.2_); _provided_ that during such period of two Business Days following the
date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 8.1_, no Party
shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.1(f)_ and Seller cooperates with Buyer to effect the Closing.

_Section 10.2_ _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become wholly void and of no further force and effect, all further obligations
of the Parties shall terminate and there shall be no Liability on the part of
any Party (or any stockholder, Affiliate, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or Representative of such Party) to any other Party (or its
stockholders, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants
or Representatives), except that the Limited Guarantees will survive in
accordance with their respective terms and the provisions of _Section
6.2(b)_, this _Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_ and _Article 11_ of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the Parties shall remain

 



146  bound by and continue to be subject to the provisions thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to _Section 10.3_, the provisions
of this _Section 10.2_ shall not relieve either party of any Liability for
any willful and intentional breach of this Agreement occurring prior to the
termination of this Agreement, or pursuant to the sections specified in this
_Section 10.2_ to survive such termination. 

_Section 10.3_ _Expenses and Termination Fee_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, including in
this _Section 10.3_, _Section 6.14(g)_ and  _Section 6.15(f)_, whether or
not the Closing occurs, Seller and Buyer shall each pay their respective
expenses (such as legal, investment banker and accounting fees) incurred in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby; _provided_ , _that_ , any expenses of the Purchased
Entities incurred in connection with this Agreement (and the
other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby) up to and including the Closing shall be borne by Seller and, except
as expressly set forth in _Section 6.6(j)_, all Deal Related Severance shall
be borne by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall pay all filing
fees in connection with filings under the HSR Act and other applicable
Antitrust Laws. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this _Section
10.3(a)_ (or  _Section 10.3(b)(ii)_ to the extent payable in accordance with
this Agreement), all costs and expenses arising out of or relating to, or
necessary to effect, the Operational Separation Activities incurred by Seller
shall be borne by Seller, including (i) all VAT and Transfer Taxes (and other
Taxes) incurred in connection with the Operational Separation Activities, (ii)
all Deal Related Severance incurred in connection with the Operational
Separation Activities and (iii) all property upfitting and the separation of
the Business Real Property such that is suitable for use in a stand-alone
business, and development of the IT Infrastructure; _provided_ that Buyer
shall be responsible for (and in no event shall Seller be responsible for)
the costs of third party Intellectual Property, services and technology for
periods following the Closing Date (or, with respect to Delayed Transfer
Jurisdictions, the Delayed Transfer Closing), including pursuant to Shared
Contracts (including through treatment as a prepaid asset in Final Closing Net
Working Capital or if not so treated Buyer will reimburse Seller for any such
amounts not so reflected as a prepaid asset).

 

(b) _Buyer Payment_.

 

(i) Buyer shall pay to Seller a cash amount equal to $520,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Seller
pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)_ or _Section 10.1(f)_. Buyer shall pay to
Seller the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Seller promptly but in no event later than ten
Business Days after the date of such termination.

(ii) In the event that (x) this Agreement is terminated (other than by Seller
pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)_ or _Section 10.1(f)_ in circumstances under
which the Termination Fee is paid), (y) at the time of termination, the
condition set forth in _Section 7.3(d)_ (other than the last sentence
thereof) is satisfied and (z) at the time of termination, Seller is not then
in breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement such that any condition set forth in _Section
7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ is not then satisfied, then Buyer shall pay to
Seller a cash amount equal to $26,000,000 (such payment by Buyer, the " _Tax
Restoration Amount_ "). Buyer shall pay to Seller the Tax Restoration Amount
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Seller promptly but in no event later than ten Business Days after the date of
such termination.

(c) _Termination Fee Payment_. The Parties acknowledge that (i) the agreement
contained in this  _Section 10.3_ is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)

 



147  the amount of, and the basis for payment of, the fee described herein is
reasonable and appropriate in all respects and (iii) without this agreement,
the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails
to pay in a timely manner the Termination Fee or Tax Restoration Amount, as
applicable, and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller makes a claim that
results in a judgment for the amount set forth in  _Section 10.3(b)_, Buyer
shall pay to Seller its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
fees and costs of counsel) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount set forth in _Section 10.3(b)_ at the prime rate of
J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time from the date such
payment was required to be made hereunder. All payments under _Section
10.3(b)_ or this _Section 10.3(c)_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller.

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, subject to Sellers right to seek specific performance pursuant to
_Section 11.7_, if Buyer fails to effect the Closing when required by
_Section 8.1_ for any or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement in
any way (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) prior
to the Closing or fails to perform hereunder in any way (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) prior to the Closing, then, (i)
the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and its Subsidiaries against (a) Buyer
or the Investors, (b) any Lender or prospective lender, lead arranger,
arranger, agent or representative of or to Buyer or the Investors (including
the Debt Financing Sources), and (c) the direct or indirect, former, current
and future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company
interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Representatives, Affiliates, members, managers, or assignees of
any Person named in clause (a) or (b) (the Persons described in clauses (a)
through (c), collectively, the " _Buyer Related Parties_ ") for any
Losses suffered as a result thereof or any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, any of transactions
contemplated hereby, the Limited Guarantees or the Financing Commitments shall
be (A) the right to terminate this Agreement (subject to the terms of
_Section 10.1_) and receive payment of the Termination Fee or Tax Restoration
Amount, as applicable, from Buyer (or the applicable Investors in accordance
with the Limited Guarantees) (and in each case, the expenses and interest, if
any, contemplated by the second sentence of _Section 10.3(c)_) as and only to
the extent provided by _Section 10.3(b)_ and _Section 10.3(c)_, or (B) the
right of Seller to seek to enforce the obligations of Buyer by a decree of
specific performance and to seek temporary, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the
obligations of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by _Section 11.7_ and (ii) except as provided in the
immediately foregoing clause (i), none of the Buyer Related Parties will have
any Liability or other obligation (in each case whether absolute, accrued,
contingent, fixed or otherwise) to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
(including its shareholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, Representatives and agents) relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Financing Commitments or in respect of any other
agreement, document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, through Buyer or otherwise, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Buyer
or against any other Buyer Related Party, by the enforcement of any assessment
or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation
or other applicable Law, or otherwise. Upon termination of this Agreement by
Seller and the receipt by Seller of the Termination Fee or Tax Restoration
Amount, as applicable (and in each case, the expenses and interest, if
any, contemplated by the second sentence of _Section 10.3(c)_), none of the
Buyer Related Parties shall have any further Liability or other obligation to
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Limited Guarantees, the Financing Commitments or in respect of
any of the other Transaction Documents or any theory of law or equity or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. Without limiting the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources
under the Debt Financing Commitments, Seller acknowledges and agrees that no
Debt Financing Source shall have any liability or obligation to the Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the other

 



148  Transaction Documents if such Debt Financing Source breaches or fails to
perform or otherwise does not perform (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) any of its obligations under the Debt Financing
Commitments. The election of Seller to pursue an injunction or specific
performance in accordance with _Section 11.7_ shall not restrict, impair or
otherwise limit Seller from subsequently seeking to terminate this Agreement
and seeking to collect the Termination Fee or Tax Restoration Amount, as
applicable, pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
under no circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive (x)
both a grant of specific performance of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to _Section 11.7_ and the payment of the
Termination Fee or Tax Restoration Amount, as applicable, or (y) both the
Termination Fee and the Tax Restoration Amount.

or to such other address as any such Party shall designate by written notice
to the other Party as provided in this _Section 11.1_.

_Section 11.2_ _Bulk Transfers_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller
and the Other Asset Sellers with the provisions of all applicable Laws
relating to bulk transfers or similar provisions in connection with the
Transfer of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets. Buyer shall not
withhold any portion of the Purchase Price based on any such non-compliance.
Except as provided in this _Section 11.2_, the foregoing shall not limit (a)
any representations or warranties of Seller in this Agreement or (b) Buyers
right to withhold any amount pursuant to _Section 3.7_ of this Agreement.

_Section 11.3_ _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances other than those which it
is determined to be illegal, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or
otherwise affected and shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in
good faith to replace such illegal, void or unenforceable provision with a
provision that corresponds as closely as possible to the intentions of the
Parties as expressed by such illegal, void or unenforceable provision.

 

 _Section 11.4_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. Copies of
executed counterparts transmitted by telecopy, telefax, .pdf email
transmission or other electronic transmission service shall be considered
original executed counterparts for purposes of this _Section 11.4._ Once
this Agreement is signed, any reproduction of this Agreement made by reliable
means (for example, photocopy or facsimile) is considered an original, to the
extent permissible under applicable Law.

_Section 11.5_ _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall
not be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the
other Party, and any attempted assignment, without such consent, shall be null
and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of Seller, Buyer
may assign its rights or obligations hereunder (A) to any Other Buyer
(including the right to purchase any of the Purchased Assets or Purchased
Shares and the obligation to assume all or part of the Assumed Liabilities, as
the case may be, in which event all references herein to Buyer will be deemed
to refer to such Other Buyer, as appropriate), (B) to any Person that acquires
all or a material portion of Buyer or, following the Closing, the Business and
(C) for collateral security purposes to the lenders providing the financing
for transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing Sources), and
all extensions, renewals, replacements, refinancings and refundings thereof
(or an agent or trustee therefor); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
assignment shall limit or affect the obligations of Buyer hereunder. Any
obligation of any Party to any other Party under this Agreement, which
obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such Party,
shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than Buyer, Seller or their
successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this

 



150  Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) the Debt Financing Sources shall be express
third party beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely upon _Section
10.3(d)_, the last sentence of _Section 11.6_, _Section 11.7_, the proviso
in _Section 11.8_, _Section 11.9_, _Section 11.13_, _Section 11.14_ and
this _Section 11.5(i)_ and (v), and each Debt Financing Source may enforce
such provisions, (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall be express third party
beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely upon and enforce _Article 9_
and this _Section 11.5(ii)_, (iii) the Investors, their respective
affiliated investment funds and management companies (as applicable) shall be
express third party beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely upon and
enforce _Section 6.4_ and this  _Section 11.5(iii)_, (iv) the Releasees
shall be express third party beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely
upon and enforce _Section 6.18(d)_ and this _Section 11.5(iv)_, (v) the
Buyer Related Parties (other than Buyer) shall be express third party
beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely upon and enforce _Section
10.3(d)_, _Section 11.14_ and this _Section 11.5(v),_ (vi) Carlyle
Investment Management L.L.C. shall be an express third party beneficiary of
and shall be entitled to rely upon and enforce the last two sentences of
_Section 6.12_ and this _Section 11.5(vi)_, (vii) the past, present or
future directors, officers, employees, incorporators, members, partners,
stockholders, Affiliates, agents, attorneys or other Representatives of Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Seller Related Parties_ ") shall
be express third party beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely upon
and enforce _Section 11.14_ and this _Section 11.5(vii)_, and (viii) the
Business Indemnitees shall be express third party beneficiaries of and shall
be entitled to rely upon and enforce _Section 6.9_ and this _Section
11.5(viii)_.

_Section 11.6_ _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified only by a written instrument executed by
both Parties. No waiver by either Party of any of the provisions hereof shall
be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the Party
so waiving. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
Party, or a failure or delay by any Party in exercising any power, right
or privilege under this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by
the Party taking such action of compliance with any representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements contained herein, or in any documents
delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with
the Closing hereunder. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of
this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section
10.3(d)_, _Section 11.5(i) _and (v), _Section 11.7_, the proviso in _Section
11.8_, _Section 11.9_, _Section 11.13_, _Section 11.14_, and this 
_Section 11.6_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify
the substance of _Section 10.3(d), Section 11.5(i) _and (v),  _Section
11.7_, the proviso in _Section 11.8_, _Section 11.9_, _Section 11.13_,
_Section 11.14_ and this _Section 11.6_) may not be amended, modified,
waived or terminated in a manner that adversely impacts in any respect the
Debt Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing
Sources.

 

 _Section 11.7_ _Specific Performance_. Subject to the following sentence,
the Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were
otherwise breached and that the Parties shall be entitled (without the
requirement to post a bond or other security) to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches and threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties agree
that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall only be
entitled to seek or obtain any injunction, specific performance or any other
equitable relief requiring Buyer to cause the Equity Financing to be funded,
to specifically enforce its rights under the Equity Financing Commitments or
to cause Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including
to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 8.1_, on the terms and
subject to the conditions in this Agreement, if and only if: (i) this
Agreement has not been validly terminated in accordance with _Section 10.1_,
(ii) all conditions in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ have been satisfied
as of the date on which the Closing would otherwise be required to occur
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but

 



151  which shall be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur),
(iii) Buyer fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing would
otherwise be required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 8.1_, (iv) the
Debt Financing (or alternative financing in accordance with, and satisfies the
conditions of, _Section 6.15_) has been funded or would be funded to Buyer at
the Closing (or, if such Debt Financing has been funded into escrow, such
funds have been or will be released from escrow at the Closing) if the Equity
Financing were to be funded at Closing and (v) Seller has irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Buyer that Seller is prepared, able and would take
such actions required of it by this Agreement to effect the Closing upon the
funding of the Equity Financing and Debt Financing. For the avoidance of
doubt, under no circumstances will Seller be entitled to obtain, and Seller
will not seek, specific performance or other equitable relief in respect of
any of the matters described in the preceding sentence unless each of clauses
(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) are true. The election of Seller to pursue
an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise
limit Seller from subsequently seeking to terminate this Agreement and seeking
to collect the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that under no circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled
to receive both a grant of specific performance resulting in the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and the payment of the Termination
Fee.

 

 _Section 11.8_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims and
Proceedings arising out of this Agreement (and any actions of any Party
hereto in the negotiation, administration, or performance hereof or the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement) shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State
of Delaware (whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise), without
regard to any conflicts or choice of law principles that would result in the
application of any Law other than the Law of the State of Delaware; _provided_
, _that_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, any such disputes involving the
Debt Financing Sources will be governed by and construed in accordance with
the applicable Laws of the State of New York without giving regard to
conflicts or choice of law principles that would result in the application of
any Law other than the Law of the State of New York.

_Section 11.9_ _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
Federal court of the United States of America located within the State of
Delaware, with respect to any and all claims and Proceedings related to this
Agreement (and any actions of any Party hereto in the negotiation,
administration, performance or enforcement of this Agreement) and
the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including resolution of disputes
under _Article 9_  hereof), and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or
other Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that
it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or other Proceeding may
not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof
may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally agree that all claims with respect to such action, suit or
other Proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or, to
the extent permitted by Law, Federal court. The Parties hereby consent to
and grant any such court jurisdiction over the Person of such Parties and
over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or
other papers in connection with any such action, suit or Proceeding in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 11.1_ or in such other manner as may
be permitted by applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.
With respect to any particular action, suit or other Proceeding contemplated
above, venue shall lie solely in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or such Federal court located within the State of Delaware. The
Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that final and non-
appealable judgment against a party in any action or Proceeding contemplated
above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within
or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified

 



152  or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and
amount of such judgment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees that it will not bring, or support
the bringing of, any Proceeding, action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity,
whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, against the Debt
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), and
each Party makes the agreements, waivers and consents set forth above in this
_Section 11.9_ _mutatis mutandis_ for any such Proceedings but with respect
to the courts specified in this sentence. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not bring or support any action or Proceeding described in this _Section
11.9_ other than in the courts as described above.

 

 _Section 11.10_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Disclosure Letter and the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto set forth the entire agreement and understanding
of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, representations
or warranties relating to such subject matter. In the event of any
inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and any Closing
Transfer Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail. In the
event of any inconsistency between  _Section 6.18(f)_ of this Agreement and
any other Signing Date Document, the provisions of _Section 6.18(f)_ of this
Agreement shall prevail. The Confidentiality Agreement (other than those
provisions restricting the use and disclosure of Buyers or its Affiliates
Evaluation Material (as defined therein), which will continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms) shall be automatically terminated
and be of no further force and effect effectively immediately upon the
earlier of (a) Closing and (b) the termination of the Confidentiality
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

 _Section 11.11_ _No Joint Venture_. Nothing in this Agreement creates a
joint venture or partnership between the Parties. This Agreement does not
authorize any Party (a) to bind or commit, or to act as an agent, employee or
legal representative of, another Party, except as may be specifically set
forth in other provisions of this Agreement, or (b) to have the power to
control the activities and operations of another Party. The Parties are
independent contractors with respect to each other under this Agreement. Each
Party agrees not to hold itself out as having any authority or relationship
contrary to this _Section 11.11_.

_Section 11.12_ _Limitation on Liability_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT TO THE
CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY HERETO, OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, BE
LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL (OTHER THAN ARISING BY REASON OF
OR RESULTING FROM EFFORTS TO MITIGATE LOSSES), EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIMINUITIONS OR
REDUCTIONS IN VALUE, LOST PROFITS, LOST OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOST
SALES OR OTHER SPECULATIVE DAMAGES) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES,
DAMAGES OR INJURIES ARISING OUT OF ANY BREACH BY SUCH PARTY OF THIS AGREEMENT,
OR ANY FAILURE OF SUCH PARTY TO PERFORM ITS OBIGATIONS HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER SUCH BREACHING OR NONPERFORMING PARTY WAS ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR NOT; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT A PERSONS ABILITY
TO RECOVER ANY LOSSES IN RESPECT OF SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT AWARDED TO A THIRD PARTY BY A
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY OR ARBITRATOR IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-PARTY CLAIM.

 



153 _Section 11.13_ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
THE FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF
(INCLUDING ANY PROCEEDING INVOLVING THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE DEBT
FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR ANY SOURCE OF FINANCING UNDER THE EQUITY FINANCING
COMMITMENTS). THE PARTIES HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
EQUITY OR OTHERWISE) BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES
IN ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH PARTY HERETO (I)
CONSENTS TO TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS, (II) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (III) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
11.13_.

 

 _Section 11.14_ _Non-Recourse_. Except to the extent otherwise expressly set
forth in the Limited Guarantees and the Equity Commitment Letters, all
claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract or
in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon,
in respect of, arise under or out of this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution, or performance of this Agreement may only be made or enforced
against the Parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Except to the extent
a Party to this Agreement or the Limited Guarantees or the Equity Commitment
Letters (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by
such Person in this Agreement or the Limited Guarantees or the Equity
Commitment Letters, respectively, and not otherwise), no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any Party
hereto, shall have any Liability for any obligations or Liabilities of such
Party under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection with this Agreement (unless a signatory party thereto in his or her
personal capacity and not on behalf of a Party) for any claim (whether arising
in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, such obligations, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any

other applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Seller (and its stockholders, partners,
members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, Representatives and

Party (other than claims against Buyer under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document and claims against Sponsor and GIC under its respective
Limited Guarantee) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under or out

the Closing, the Purchased Entities, and for Buyers and, following the

its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and legal counsel, on the other hand,
including Fenwick and West LLP and Baker and McKenzie LLP, made in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or Action arising under or in connection with, this Agreement which,
immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged
communications of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased
Entities) and their counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to Buyer
in connection with any process relating to a dispute arising under or in
connection with this Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing
to be privileged communications between Seller and such counsel, and neither
Buyer nor any Person, acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through
Buyer shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the
privilege attaching to such communications belongs to the Purchased Entities
and not to Seller. Buyer and the Purchased Entities agree that any attorney-
client privilege, attorney work-product protection, and expectation of client
confidence arising from or as a result of Fenwick and West LLPs and Baker and
McKenzie LLPs representation of an Purchased Entity or Seller in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or
any dispute or Action arising under or in connection with, this Agreement and
which exists prior to the Closing, and all information and documents covered
by such privilege or protection, shall belong to and be controlled by Seller
and may be waived only by the Seller, and not a Purchased Entity, and shall
not pass to or be claimed or used by Buyer or any Purchased Entity, except
with respect to the assertion of such privilege or protection against a third
party.

 _Calculation Principles_

 

Section 1\. Closing Net Working Capital Accounts

 

Closing Net Working Capital of the Business shall be equal to (i) Closing
Current Assets of the Business, _minus_ (ii) the Closing Current Liabilities
of the Business. The Current Assets and Current Liabilities shall be
determined in accordance with the methodology set forth below and further in
Section 2 of this Appendix F and in the form illustrated in Schedule F of
this Appendix F.



     | A. | " _Closing Current Assets_ " shall mean the sum of: 
---|---|--- 



     | a. | Accounts receivable, Net 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | Inventory, Net 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Short-term deferred commissions 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Other current assets 
---|---|--- 

For the avoidance of doubt, Closing Current Assets shall not include any (i)
Business Cash, (ii) Excluded Assets, or (iii) Transferred Pension Assets.



     | B. | " _Closing Current Liabilities_ " shall mean the sum of: 
---|---|--- 



     | a. | Accounts payable 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | Accrued compensation and benefits 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Short-term deferred revenue 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Other current liabilities 
---|---|--- 

For the avoidance of doubt, Closing Current Liabilities shall not include any
(i) Deal Related Severance, (ii) Change of Control Bonuses, (iii) Transferred
Pension Liabilities, (iv) Indebtedness, (v) expenses described in Section 10.3
of the Agreement, (vi) any Taxes recoverable from Buyer under _Section
6.8(a)(ii)(g)_ of the Agreement, (vii) asset retirement obligations, (viii)
accounts payable owed with respect to assets that have been capitalized, or
(ix) Excluded Liabilities.

For the avoidance of doubt, Closing Net Working Capital shall not include
intercompany receivables or payables (other than the Assumed Intercompany
Payables or Assumed Intercompany Receivables).

Section 2\. Scope and Methodology 

For all purposes including for purposes of determining Closing Net Working
Capital, Business Cash and Business Indebtedness, the Calculation Principles
shall be GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the principles, policies and
methodologies used in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements.
Further, normal year-end closing procedures will be applied when determining
Closing Net Working Capital, Business Cash and Business Indebtedness.

The Closing Statement and the Estimated Closing Statement shall each (i)
reflect the Purchased Entities, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities on a consolidated basis and any intercompany accounts solely
between them shall be excluded, and (ii) not include any changes in assets or
liabilities as

 



F-1  a result of purchase or other non-cash accounting adjustments or other
changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the payment of the
Estimated Consideration or the financing of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Only the pro rata share of current assets and current liabilities of any Non-
Wholly Owned Entity (based upon Sellers direct or indirect equity ownership
of such entity as of immediately prior to the Closing) shall be used in the
determination of Closing Net Working Capital.

 



F-2 _APPENDIX G_

 

Pension Calculation Principles

Solely for the purposes of the determination of the Net Pension Liabilities
and the amount of Transferred Pension Liabilities and Transferred Pension
Assets described in _Section 4.12(q)_, the following principles apply.

 

The amount of Transferred Pension Liabilities described in clause (A) of the
definition thereof shall be determined (x) on a projected benefit obligation
basis with respect to defined benefit plans and (y) on an accrued benefit
basis with respect to defined contribution plans, in each case, regardless of
whether benefits are vested or unvested, and calculated as of the Closing
Date (including if (A) related to an Applicable Seller Retirement Plan or
Business Retirement Plan in a Delayed Transfer Country where actual
Transferred Pension Liabilities may not be assumed by Buyer until such Delayed
Transfer Closing or the transfer of such Transferred Pension Liabilities does
not otherwise actually occur as of the Closing Date or (B) related to a
Business Retirement Plan to which benefit obligations are transferred as part
of Operational Separation or in which benefit obligations are accrued prior
to Closing) and regardless of the amount of (or the actual timing of the
assumption of) benefit liabilities actually assumed by Buyer or its
Affiliates.

 

The value of Transferred Pension Assets shall be determined based on the fair
market value thereof on the later to occur of, as applicable, (i) the
close of business on the date of assumption or retention of sponsorship by
Buyer or its Affiliates of the applicable Business Retirement Plan or (ii) the
close of business on the date on which such assets are transferred to such
Business Retirement Plan; _provided_ , _that_ , for the avoidance of doubt,
any assets transferred after (x) the first anniversary of the Closing shall be
disregarded for purposes of calculating the Net Pension Liabilities or (y) the
second anniversary of the Closing shall be disregarded for purposes of
calculating the Transferred Pension Assets for purposes of _Section 4.12(q)_.

 

Without limiting the foregoing, the amount of Transferred Pension Liabilities
described in clause (A) of the definition thereof and Transferred
Pension Assets shall be determined using the methodology, assumptions and
procedures set forth on _Schedule G_ , as adjusted as described below:



     | (i) | the value of the assets used in the determination of the
Transferred Pension Assets shall be increased by (x) the amount of any benefit
payments made from the corresponding Applicable Seller Retirement Plan to
the Continuing Employees, and former employees who were Continuing Employees
prior to their termination of employment, after the Closing but prior to the
date of the transfer of pension assets to the New Business Retirement Plan and
(y) the amount of any benefit payments made from a Business Retirement Plan
(or Applicable Seller Retirement Plans) that is maintained in a Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction and not assumed by Buyer at Closing, to the extent such
payments are made to the Business Employees, and former employees who were
Business Employees prior to their termination of employment, after the Closing
but prior to the date of assumption or retention of sponsorship by Buyer or
its Affiliates of the applicable Business Retirement Plan, in each case, to
the extent such payments reduce the benefit obligations under the
corresponding benefit plan and are paid prior to the first anniversary of the
Closing in the case of Net Pension Liabilities, or prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing, in the case of _Section 4.12(q)_ (the amount of
all such payments under this clause (i), the " _Seller-Paid Transferred
Pension Assets_ "); 
---|---|--- 
 



G-1 applied to determine the amount of Transferred Pension Liabilities and the
value of Transferred Pension Assets regardless of whether the liabilities of
the Applicable Seller Retirement Plans or Business Retirement Plans were
determined for purposes of, or set forth in, the Audited Financial Statements
(but, for the avoidance of doubt, the value of the assets used in the
determination of the value of the Transferred Pension Assets shall only be
determined with respect to the Business Retirement Plans if such Business
Retirement Plans contain assets or are transferred assets in accordance with
_Section 6.6(x)_); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | for purposes of determining the applicable dollar exchange
rates in regard to the amount of Transferred Pension Liabilities and value of
Transferred Pension Assets as denominated in dollars, the applicable
Designated Exchange Rates shall be used; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | the actual employee census data as of the date for which
such Transferred Pension Liabilities are being calculated shall be used; 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | the amount of creditable service shall be determined as of,
and include all creditable service performed as of, the date for which such
Transferred Pension Liabilities are being calculated; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) | the value of assets, other than insurance contracts, used
in the determination of the value of Transferred Pension Assets shall be
determined based on their respective fair market value as of the applicable
date for which such value is being calculated; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | the value of assets which are insurance contracts used in
the determination of the value of Transferred Pension Assets shall be
determined as of the applicable date for which such value is being calculated
using the actuarial methodology, assumptions and procedures set forth in
_Schedule G_; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (viii) | the amount of Transferred Pension Liabilities shall be
deemed to include all Deal Related Severance that would have otherwise been
included as a Transferred Pension Liability pursuant to the provisions hereof,
had such amounts not been paid prior to the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 

The amount of Transferred Pension Liabilities described in clause (B) of
the definition thereof shall be determined as of the date Buyer or such
Affiliate is required to pay such Taxes; _provided_ , _that_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, any such Taxes paid (x) after the first anniversary of the
Closing shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the Net Pension
Liabilities and (y) after the second anniversary of the Closing shall be
disregarded for purposes of calculating the Transferred Pension Liabilities
for purposes of  _Section 4.12(q)_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that the aggregate
value of Transferred Pension Assets exceeds the aggregate amount of
Transferred Pension Liabilities described in clause (A) of the definition
thereof, as calculated for purposes of determining the Net Pension Liabilities
for any Applicable Seller Retirement Plan or any Business Retirement Plan,
the amount of such excess shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the
amount of Net Pension Liabilities.

The Transferred Pension Liabilities described in clause (A) of the definition
thereof and Transferred Pension Assets with respect to any Applicable Seller
Retirement Plan or any Business Retirement Plan for which any related
Applicable Seller Retirement Plan is not set forth on _Schedule G_ shall,
for the avoidance of doubt, still be determined based on methodology,
assumptions and procedures described above (including the first three
sentences of this _Appendix G_ ) and shall be determined using the
methodology, assumptions and procedures appropriate for such jurisdiction.

 



G-2 _APPENDIX H_

 

Delayed Transfer Closing Principles

1. Seller acknowledges that the Closing is conditional on the completion of
Operational Separation in all material respects in the Principal
Jurisdictions. Buyer acknowledges that there may be a Delayed Transfer Closing
in one or more countries (other than, without the written consent of Buyer, a
Principal Jurisdiction) in the event that Operational Separation has not been
completed in such country in all material respects as of the Closing or in the
event that (in each case, excluding any of the following to the extent
arising pursuant to or under any Antitrust Law for the jurisdictions described
in _Schedule 7.1(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter, each of which is a condition to
the Closing):

 

 __(a) any filing with or consent or approval of a Governmental Authority
and/or expiration of mandatory waiting periods any required to consummate (i)
the sale by Seller (or applicable Other Share Sellers), and the purchase by
Buyer (or applicable Other Buyers), of the Purchased Shares or (ii) the sale
by Seller (or applicable Other Asset Sellers), and the purchase by Buyer (or
applicable Other Buyers), of the Purchased Assets and/or the assumption by
Buyer (or applicable Other Buyers) of the Assumed Liabilities (collectively,
the " _Contemplated Transactions_ "), in such country, has not been made or
obtained or has not expired, as applicable, at the time of the Closing; __

(b) any Governmental Authority in such country shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any Law which is in effect on the Closing
Date that has the effect of making a Contemplated Transaction illegal or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of such Contemplated Transaction in
such country;

(c) any notification to, or where appropriate, consultation or negotiation
with a works council, union, labor board or employee group or Governmental
Authority required by Law to effect a Contemplated Transaction with respect to
such country has not been completed at the time of the Closing;

 

(d) any notification to, or where appropriate, negotiations with, or
expiration of all mandatory waiting periods with respect to, creditors and
other third parties with objection or other rights under applicable Law

not been completed or expired at the time of the Closing; and

 

(e) the relevant Purchased Entity in such country is not fully formed,
organized or incorporated and in receipt of the necessary Permits for the
conduct of the Business in such country.

In such event, in accordance with this _Appendix H_ , the closing of the
Contemplated Transaction in respect of such country will be a Delayed
Transfer Closing, solely with respect to the Purchased Shares (and Purchased
Entities represented thereby), Purchased Assets and/or Assumed Liabilities
related to such country and such country shall be deemed a Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, no country
shall be a Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction unless it is so for one or more of
the reasons set out in _Section 2.7(c)_ of the Agreement or this _Section
1_ of this _Appendix H_.

2\. In the event of any Delayed Transfer Closing for any particular Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties:

Purchased Shares (and the Purchased Entities represented thereby) shall 

 



H-1  not be conveyed, assigned, transferred or delivered to Buyer (or applicable
Other Buyers), (2) the legal interest in and to such Purchased Assets shall
not be conveyed, assigned, transferred or delivered to Buyer (or applicable
Other Buyers), and (3) such Assumed Liabilities shall not be assumed by Buyer
(or applicable Other Buyers), until the relevant Delayed Transfer Closing
occurs (in each case, subject to  _Section 2.6_ of the Agreement);

(b) with respect to the matters described in _Section 1(a)-(e)_ above, (i)
the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to make such filings,
obtain any such required consents or approvals, resolve any such prohibitions
under Law, cause the expiration of any such mandatory waiting periods,
complete any such required notifications, consultations or negotiations,
form, organize or incorporate with the necessary Permits in the relevant
Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction any such Purchased Entities, and/or (ii) in the
case Operational Separation is not complete in the relevant Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction, Seller shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts to
complete the Operational Separation in such Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction, in
each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing (provided,
that in no event shall the foregoing require Buyer or any applicable Other
Buyer to, and Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
without Buyers prior written consent, commit to any divestiture transaction,
commit to alter their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that would reasonably be expected
to limit Buyers or any of its Subsidiaries freedom of action with
respect to, or Buyers or any of its Subsidiaries ability to retain any of
the businesses, product lines or assets of, the Business or otherwise receive
the full benefits of the Agreement (except as otherwise expressly required
by  _Section 6.3(f)_ of the Agreement));

(c) to the extent permitted under applicable Law, the Buyer (or the applicable
Other Buyers) shall acquire beneficial interest in and to such Purchased
Shares (and the Purchased Entities represented thereby) and Purchased Assets
in respect of the relevant Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction and shall assume
responsibility for such Assumed Liabilities in respect of such Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction at the Closing (including all cash and cash equivalents
as of the Closing and all cash and cash equivalents generated from and after
Closing), in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement;

(d) the Closing Net Working Capital, Business Indebtedness and Business Cash
of, or associated with, the relevant Delayed Transfer Jurisdictions shall be
included in the determination of Final Closing Net Working Capital, Final
Business Indebtedness and Business Cash in each case, for all purposes of the
Agreement;

 

(e) without limiting paragraph (f) below, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, for the period of time commencing upon the Closing and
terminating upon the occurrence of the relevant Delayed Transfer Closing,
Seller and its Subsidiaries shall conduct the Business in the relevant Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction in accordance with Buyers reasonable instructions
and for the sole benefit and sole detriment of Buyer (or the applicable Other
Buyers) so that all of the benefits and detriments attributable to the
Purchased Shares (and the Purchased Entities represented thereby), Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities in respect of the relevant Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction, including use, risk of loss, potential for gain and dominion,
and control and command over those Purchased Shares (and the Purchased
Entities represented thereby), Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities,
inure from and after Closing solely to Buyer (or applicable Other Buyers),
without limiting the foregoing, Buyer will be responsible for all costs and
expenses for operating the Business in the relevant Delayed Transfer
Jurisdiction; and

(f) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall operate the Business in the relevant
Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction in the ordinary course of business, in
compliance with applicable Law and subject to the covenants of Seller set
forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ of the Agreement.

 



H-2 3\. Provided that consummation of the Delayed Transfer Closing with respect to
the relevant Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction shall not be restrained, enjoined
or prohibited by any order under Law issued by any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction, and there shall not have been any Law enacted,
promulgated or deemed applicable to the relevant Delayed Transfer Closing
with respect to such Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction by any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction that prevents the consummation of such
Contemplated Transactions or has the effect of making such consummation
thereof illegal with respect to the relevant Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction,
the Delayed Transfer Closing shall occur no later than thirty (30) days after
the following (each to the extent applicable to such Delayed
Transfer Jurisdiction):

(a) the receipt of all required consents or approvals, the resolution of all
applicable orders under Law and the expiration of all mandatory waiting
periods;

Entity and receipt by such Purchased Entity of the necessary Permits for the
conduct of the Business; and

(d) Operational Separation shall have been completed in all material respects
in such Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction;

or at such other time as the Parties may mutually agree upon in writing.

 

4\. References in the Agreement to (x) the Closing or the Closing Date shall
be deemed to be references to the date of relevant Delayed Transfer
Closing for the purposes of Sections 1.1 (with respect to the definition of
"Business Employee", "Purchased Entity Employees"), 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6,
4.2, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1(a), 6.1(b) and 6.1(d), 6.2(a), 6.3, 6.7, 6.8(c)(iii),

the direction or instruction of Buyer), in each case to the extent applicable
in connection with any Delayed Transfer Jurisdiction and (y) Purchase
Transaction shall be deemed to reference the Contemplated Transactions, in
each case to the extent applicable and as the context requires. For clarity,
the aforementioned references to Sections 9.1(a)(i) and 9.1(b)(i) (the "
_Specified Indemnification Provisions_ "), (x) in the case of a particular
representation or warranty that addresses compliance with contracts or Law,
will operate to substitute references to the Closing Date with references to
the date of the applicable Delayed Transfer Closing and (y) in the case of a
particular representation or warranty that addresses financial or tax accrual
or payment matters, will _not_ operate to substitute references to the Closing
Date with references to the date of the applicable Delayed Transfer Closing,
in each case with respect to determining the indemnification obligations of
Seller and Buyer pursuant to the Specified Indemnification Provisions.

 

5\. In connection with any Delayed Transfer Closing where an allocation of the
purchase price is required to be paid pursuant to applicable Law on such
Delayed Transfer Closing by the Buyer or the applicable Other Buyer to Seller
