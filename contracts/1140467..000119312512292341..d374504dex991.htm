The effectiveness of the resolutions relating to the Merger that are
contained in the Merger Resolutions shall be expressly conditioned on (and
only on) the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article 8. The parties hereby acknowledge that the

 



15  occurrence of the Closing Date (and the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated hereby) is not conditioned upon the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the closing of the DIFA Merger set forth in
Article 10 of the DIFA Merger Agreement or the simultaneous closing of the
DIFA Merger and the Merger, but that the closing of the DIFA Merger is
conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the

(c) For purposes hereof, "Merger Consideration" means 1,070,000,000 Company

1,015,000,000 Company Series B Shares and 70,056,745 Company Series C Shares;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the event of any inaccuracy or breach of the
representation set forth in Section 3.03 or of the covenant set forth in

Series C Shares shall be equitably adjusted to achieve an ownership percentage
in the outstanding capital stock of the Company equivalent to the ownership
percentage ABI and its Affiliates would have received hereunder in the absence
of such inaccuracy or breach.

Section 2.03 _The Closing of the Merger_. At 10:00 a.m., Mexico City time, on
the date that is the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all
the conditions set forth in Article 8, other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date, the "Closing Date"),
the parties hereto shall take all actions necessary or desirable to file for
and obtain the formal recordation and registration of the Merger Resolutions
in the RPC. Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
the actions necessary to cause the effectiveness of the Merger to occur
simultaneously with the actions necessary to cause the effectiveness of the
DIFA Merger to occur, together in one single transaction, subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8 of this
Agreement and in Article 10 of the DIFA Merger

 



16  Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that,
in the event that the conditions set forth in Article 10 of the DIFA Merger
Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied on the closing date of the DIFA Merger to the extent that such
conditions are capable of being satisfied as of such date) shall not have been
satisfied or waived on or prior to the date on which the conditions set forth
in Article 8 of this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied on the Closing Date to the extent that such
conditions are capable of being satisfied as of such date) shall have been
satisfied or waived, the Closing Date of the Merger shall occur in accordance
with this Agreement and the closing date of the DIFA Merger shall, if
applicable, occur in accordance with the DIFA Merger Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, assuming the timely satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article 8 of this Agreement and in Article 10 of the
DIFA Merger Agreement, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Closing Date and the effectiveness of the Merger to occur
simultaneously with the closing date and effectiveness of the DIFA Merger in
one single transaction.

Section 2.04  _Closing Actions_. The Company and Diblo shall consummate the
Merger (together with, if applicable, the DIFA Merger) pursuant to the Merger

Resolutions thereat is referred to herein as the "Effective Time."

 



18 Section 2.06 _The Offer_. (a) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions in Article 9, as soon as practicable but no later than five
(5) Business Days after the first to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y)
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in Article 9, ABI Sub or
another Subsidiary of ABI that ABI may appoint in the future with the prior
consent of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; _provided_ , that any such appointment shall not release ABI or ABI
Sub from any of its obligations hereunder (ABI Sub or such appointed
Subsidiary of ABI, the "Offeror"), shall, and ABI shall cause the Offeror to,
commence a public tender offer in Mexico (the "Offer") to purchase all of
the outstanding Company Shares in accordance with the following terms:

(i) The Offer shall be made for all outstanding Company Shares to all holders
of Company Shares on equal terms and shall be settled on the BMV. ABI and the
Offeror shall cause the Offer to be conducted in accordance with applicable
Laws, regulations, rules and interpretations of each applicable Governmental
Authority or stock exchange.

(ii) The Offer shall remain open for twenty (20) Business Days after the
Offer is commenced, unless extended in accordance with the following two
sentences (the last day the Offer is open, the "Expiration Date"). Without the
consent of a majority of the Non-ABI Directors, the Offeror shall not (A)
reduce the amount of Company Shares subject to the Offer, (B) reduce the
amount of consideration payable in the Offer for any Company Share validly
tendered in the Offer, (C) add or modify any condition to the Offer, (D)
extend the Offer (except as provided in the immediately following sentence),
(E) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (F) otherwise
amend the Offer in any manner materially adverse to the holders of Company
Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Offeror shall extend the Offer (in
increments of no greater than ten (10) Business Days), if at the then
applicable Expiration Date, (1) such extension is required by applicable Law
or the CNBV, (2) any condition to the Offerors obligation to accept for
payment and pay for Company Shares validly tendered in the Offer in paragraph
(iii) below shall not be satisfied or (3) the holders of all or a majority of
the Company Shares are enjoined (whether temporarily or permanently) by a
court of competent jurisdiction or by Order of any Governmental Authority from
validly tendering their Company Shares in the Offer and such injunction or
Order has not become final and non-appealable (unless otherwise agreed by a
majority of the non-ABI Directors), it being understood that in the case of
clause (3), the Offeror shall not be obligated to extend the Offer hereunder
by more than six (6) months from the date on which the Offer otherwise would
have expired and in no event shall ABI be obligated to extend the Offer beyond
the date that is twenty (20) Business Days after the Termination Date, as may
be extended pursuant to Section 10.01(b) (in each case, unless ABI agrees in
writing to do so). Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent ABI or any
Affiliate thereof from conducting additional offers after the Expiration Date.

 

(iii) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and as required by
applicable Law and the BMV rules, on the second Business Day following the
Expiration Date (the "Settlement Date"), the Offeror shall,

 



19  and ABI shall cause the Offeror and the Exchange Agent to, accept and pay
the Offer Consideration for all Company Shares validly tendered pursuant to
the Offer. The obligations of the Offeror to accept for payment, and pay for,
any Company Shares tendered in the Offer shall be subject solely to the
conditions that (x) such Company Shares have been validly tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer and (y) that no Law or Order shall be in effect that
would make such acceptance and payment illegal or otherwise prohibit such
acceptance and payment.

(iv) To the extent permitted under applicable Law and unless otherwise
consented to by the Company prior to the Settlement Date, in the event at
least eighty percent (80%) but less than one hundred percent (100%) of the
outstanding Company Shares are validly tendered in the Offer, the Offeror
shall establish a fully funded trust (or legal entity other than a trust, the
substitution of which shall not reasonably be expected to have any adverse
effect on the holders of Company Shares) pursuant to definitive agreements
executed by the parties thereto in accordance with the Laws of Mexico then in
effect (the "Trust") for the benefit of the holders of the
remaining outstanding Company Shares, to which any holder of Company Shares
that did not tender such shares into the Offer may look to receive the Offer
Consideration following the Settlement Date in exchange for the delivery of
the corresponding Company Shares. The purchase of Company Shares by the Trust
shall be settled on the BMV, and in connection therewith ABI shall cause the
Trust to make purchase orders on a periodic basis (to be no more frequent than
ten (10) days per calendar month) to purchase on the BMV from time to time
while the Trust is in effect all Company Shares at a price equal to the Offer
Consideration. The Trust shall remain in effect until the earliest to occur of
(a) the tender and acceptance for payment of one hundred percent (100%) of
the outstanding Company Shares, (b) the 25-month anniversary of the Settlement
Date and (c) the consummation of a capital redemption of Company Shares
following which no more than 0.4% of the Company Shares outstanding as of the
date hereof remain outstanding and are not held by ABI or its Affiliates;
_provided_ , that (i) in the case of clause (c), in no event shall the
effective time of the termination of the Trust be earlier than the date that
is six (6) months after the occurrence of the circumstances contemplated in
clause (c), (ii) nothing set forth herein shall affect ABIs or the Companys
ability to redeem, acquire or reduce the Companys capital as a means to
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for cancellation any and all of the
then-outstanding Company Shares and (iii) if at any time prior to the
termination of the Trust ABI shall deliver to the trustee for the Trust
written evidence reasonably satisfactory to such trustee that ABI has
acquired any number of Company Shares following the Settlement Date other than
through the Trust, the trustee for the Trust shall promptly distribute to ABI
an amount of immediately available funds equal to the product of such number
of Company Shares acquired by ABI other than through the Trust and the Offer
Consideration. ABI shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the registration and listing on the BMV of any Company Shares not purchased
by the Offeror pursuant to the Offer until the earlier of (x) the termination
of the Trust and (y) the date that is 25 months following the Settlement Date,
including by using commercially reasonable efforts to hold and attend
meetings and make any necessary filings and take other actions within its or
the Companys control to maintain such registration or listing;

 



20   _provided_ , that under no circumstances shall ABI be required, in
connection with maintaining such listing, to challenge any formal Order or
proceeding initiated by the CNBV ordering the de-registration or delisting of
the Company stock from the RNV and/or the BMV, to submit or otherwise
undertake any obligation to adopt any regularization program aimed at
maintaining the listing (other than requesting an extension to
such regularization), to issue more shares of the capital stock of the
Company, to take active measures to increase trading volumes and/or to sell
shares of the capital stock of the Company or take or refrain from taking any
other similar action. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trust shall be
available to accept tenders of Company Shares that are issued or issuable to
the DIFA Selling Shareholders (as defined in the DIFA Merger Agreement)
pursuant to the DIFA Merger Agreement following the later of the Settlement
Date and the date on which the DIFA Merger becomes effective, and the Offeror
shall be obligated to fully fund the Trust with the amount of the Offer
Consideration attributable to the Company Shares to be issued as consideration
in the DIFA Merger upon, but not prior to, the closing date of the DIFA
Merger.

(v) The Offeror or ABI will pay all fees and expenses incurred by ABI and any
of its Affiliates in connection with making the Offer, including those of the
Exchange Agent (which shall in no event include any fees or expenses with
respect to the exchange of U.S. dollars into Pesos, which fees and expenses
shall not be borne by the Offeror or ABI or their respective Affiliates). For
the avoidance of doubt, the Offeror shall not be responsible for fees of
brokers engaged by tendering shareholders or for other expenses incurred by
tendering shareholders in connection with the tendering of their shares. None
of the Offeror, ABI or any of ABIs Subsidiaries shall have any obligation or
responsibility in connection with any taxes that may be imposed directly
or indirectly under the Laws of any jurisdiction on the tendering
shareholders proceeds, gains or income arising from the tender of Company
Shares pursuant to the Offer or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(vi) To the extent permitted under then-applicable Law, if upon the 25-month
anniversary of the Settlement Date greater than 0.4% of the Company Shares
outstanding as of the date hereof shall remain outstanding and not be held by
ABI or its Affiliates, ABI shall, or shall cause the Offeror to, commence a
public tender offer in Mexico to purchase all of the outstanding Company
Shares upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions as the Offer;
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to any requirement of
the CNBV, the Offeror shall not be required to establish the
Trust contemplated in Section 2.06(a)(iv) following the settlement of such
public tender offer.

(b) Prior to commencing the Offer, the Offeror shall designate a Mexican
licensed broker-dealer reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as broker-
dealer for the Offer (the "Exchange Agent").

 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Shareholders Meetings
Date, ABI, the Offeror and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall execute
and file with the CNBV, the BMV, Indeval and any other applicable Governmental
Authority and/or otherwise disclose all documents required under applicable
Law and this Agreement to be filed 

 



21  in connection with the Offer and the public announcements thereof, including
the prospectus or _folleto informativo_ required therefor (collectively, the
"Mexican Offer Documents"). The Offeror and the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, will promptly correct any information provided by it in writing
for use in the Mexican Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, to
the extent any Governmental Authority shall so require or if advisable as a
means to complete the Offer. The Company will promptly inform ABI in the event
that any information provided by it in writing specifically for use in the
Mexican Offer Documents shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Each of ABI and the Offeror agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause, as may be applicable, the Mexican Offer Documents as so corrected to
be filed with the CNBV and BMV, as the case may be, and published or otherwise
disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Laws.

 

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Settlement
Date, the Offeror shall acquire all Company Shares that have been validly
tendered, and not withdrawn, in accordance with the Mexican Offer Documents
and applicable Law on or before the Expiration Date of the Offer, and pay to
the applicable tendering shareholders of the Company as consideration for
each Company Share validly tendered, and not withdrawn, by such shareholder
prior to the Expiration Date of the Offer an amount in immediately available
funds equal to US$9.15, without interest (such amount of immediately available
funds, the "Offer Consideration"). ABI, ABI Holdings and ABI Sub hereby
acknowledge that the holders of Company Shares have no obligation to
participate and sell Company Shares in the Offer and, therefore, acknowledge
that there is no certainty or assurance that the shareholders of the Company
will be willing to tender their Company Shares in the Offer.

(e) At the option of each shareholder of the Company who tenders its Company
Shares, the Offer Consideration can be paid in U.S. dollars or Pesos at the
prevailing market exchange rate available to the Exchange Agent one Business
Day prior to the Settlement Date (the "Peso Exchange Rate"). If a tendering
shareholder does not make an election or has not provided a valid U.S. dollar
account to permit such shareholder to receive U.S. dollars, the Offer
Consideration shall be paid in Pesos by the Exchange Agent at the Peso
Exchange Rate. For the avoidance of doubt, ABIs delivery to the Exchange
Agent of the aggregate Offer Consideration shall be made in U.S. dollars, and
the Exchange Agent shall obtain Pesos for payment to tendering shareholders
electing to receive Pesos; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall relieve ABI
of its obligation to pay the entire amount of the Offer Consideration payable
pursuant to the Offer and, if applicable, through the Trust on the terms set
forth herein.

(f) As and when required under applicable Law, the board of directors of the
Company will issue a public statement with respect to the Offer Consideration
pursuant to Article 101 of the LMV, which statement (if requested by the board
of directors of the Company and to the extent reasonably practicable) will be
supported by a fairness opinion received from an investment banking firm.
ABI, ABI Holdings and ABI Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that the issuance
of such statement is the responsibility of the board of directors of the
Company and, even if such statement of the board of directors is in favor of
the terms of the Offer, the

 



22  holders of Company Shares have no obligation to participate and sell Company
Shares in the Offer and, therefore, acknowledge that there is no certainty or
assurance that the shareholders of the Company will be willing to tender
their Company Shares in the Offer.

(g) Following the Effective Time, in the event that (x) ABI shall fail to
commence or close and settle the Offer as a result of either (A) a material
breach by ABI of its obligations hereunder that has caused or contributed
materially to such failure, or (B) a final, non-appealable injunction or
similar Order prohibiting ABI from commencing, closing or settling the Offer
or (y) a final, non-appealable injunction or similar Order issued by a court
of competent jurisdiction or any Governmental Authority prohibiting
the holders of all or a majority of the Company Shares from tendering their
Company Shares in the Offer, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence,
(i) the amendments to the Charter Documents contemplated by Section 2.02(a)(x)
shall not become effective and (ii) except as otherwise approved by the
Company (including pursuant to the Offer hereunder), for a period of five (5)
years following the earlier to occur of the events described in clauses (x)
and (y) of this Section 2.06(g), ABI shall be prohibited from purchasing
Company Shares, other than any Company Shares tendered in the Offer that ABI
is obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer or pursuant to the Trust and
any Company Shares that ABI has a right to acquire pursuant to its rights
under the Covenant Agreements. The foregoing sentence shall not apply (1) if,
in the case of clause (x), a material breach by the Company of its obligations
hereunder has contributed materially to the failure to commence or close and
settle the Offer and no material breach by ABI of its obligations hereunder
contributed materially to such failure, or (2) if, in the case of clause (y),
a material breach of the Covenant Agreements by any of the holders of Company
Shares has contributed materially to such injunction or Order and no material
breach by ABI of its obligations hereunder has contributed materially to such
injunction or Order.

 

Section 2.07 _Actions of the Company and Diblo_.

(a) Following the Effective Time and prior to the Settlement Date, and
notwithstanding the appointment of ABIs or any of its Subsidiaries designees
to the board of directors of the Company at any time, any (i) amendment or
termination of this Agreement approved by the Company or Diblo, (ii) extension
for the performance or waiver of the obligations of ABI, ABI Holdings or ABI
Sub hereunder, (iii) waiver of the Companys or Diblos rights hereunder,
(iv) consent of the Company or Diblo to any action of ABI, ABI Holdings or ABI
Sub required or prohibited hereunder, or (v) other decision or determination
of the Company or Diblo hereunder or with respect to or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall require the
prior approval of a majority of the Non-ABI Directors.

 

(b) From the date hereof to the Settlement Date, ABI shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, take any action or fail to take any action
(including through the exercise of any of its or their rights under the
Covenant Agreements or otherwise) with the intent to or for the purpose of, or
with the direct effect of, blocking, impeding or otherwise materially
interfering with any decision, action or non-action of the Company or Diblo
under, with respect to or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent that any such action or non-
action of the Company or Diblo would result in a breach by the Company or
Diblo of any provision hereof.

 



23 Section 2.08 _Adjustments to Transactions_. The parties hereto acknowledge
that it may become necessary or advisable after the date of this Agreement to
adjust or modify the structure of the various transactions described in this
Agreement and agree to cooperate in good faith to consider and, to the extent
mutually agreed, effectuate the adjustments or modifications reasonably
requested by any other party, required by any Governmental Authority, arising
from any change in applicable Law or necessary or advisable to fully effect
the transactions contemplated hereby;  _provided_ that no such adjustment or
modification shall, in any material respect, affect the rights and obligations
of any party under this Agreement or disadvantage any party, or reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 2.09 _Treatment of Company Performance Shares_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company and the corporate
practice committees of the Company (or, if appropriate, any duly authorized
committee thereof administering the Company Stock Purchase Plan) shall adopt
such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to provide
that, (a) following satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set forth in
Article 8 and immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company Stock
Purchase Plan will terminate and (b) following satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions set forth in Article 8 and immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company Performance Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Company Performance Shares described by the
first paragraph of Section 5.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) shall
be converted into the right to receive, no later than 5 Business Days
following the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Offer
Consideration plus an amount in cash to offset any and all taxes due or
payable by such holder (or such holders heir) as a result of such treatment
of such Company Performance Share, assuming attainment of all
applicable performance goals at the maximum level for payout (such amount,
the " _Maximum Company Performance Share Consideration_ "), (c) each Company
Performance Share outstanding on the date hereof that will vest pursuant to
its terms prior to the Effective Time shall, at the election of the holder
thereof either (i) be cancelled, prior to the Effective Time, in exchange for
a cash payment, to be paid no later than five Business Days following such
holders election, equal to the average five-day closing price of the Company
Series C Non-Voting Shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange ending as of the date
of such holders election (each, an "Early Election Performance Share")
or (ii) be converted into the right to receive the Maximum Company
Performance Share Consideration in accordance with the provisions of clause
(b), and (d) following satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set forth in
Article 8 and immediately prior to the Effective Time, each holder of an
Early Election Performance Share shall receive, no later than 5 Business Days
following the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the excess of the
Maximum Company Performance Share Consideration over the amount in cash
received by the holder of such Early Election Performance Share in accordance
with the provisions of clause (c) above. ABI and the Company acknowledge and
agree that to the extent that the treatment of the Company Performance Shares
pursuant to this Agreement causes a holder of such Company Performance Shares
to become subject to capital gains, income or similar taxation in respect of
such Company Performance Shares or any consideration received in respect
thereof, such holder shall be entitled to receive, except as provided in
clause (b) above (where such additional amount shall be paid at the time
specified therein), within 10 days prior to such tax being due to the
applicable taxing authority, an

 



24  additional payment or payments from the Company or any successor in an
amount such that, after payment of all such taxes, such holder receives the
amount it otherwise would have received absent such capital gains, income or
similar taxation.

Section 2.10 _ABI Subscription_.

 

(a) Diblo hereby grants to ABI Holdings or one of its designated Affiliates
the right to, and each of ABI and ABI Holdings, on behalf of itself and any
such designated Affiliate, hereby irrevocably accepts and agrees to, subscribe
to purchase 6,050,000 Diblo Series B-II Shares (the "ABI Subscription"), on
the first Business Day immediately following the satisfaction or waiver of
all of the conditions set forth in Article 8, other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied on the Closing Date (such Business Day, the
"ABI Subscription Closing Date"). The subscription price for each Diblo
Series B-II Share subscribed by ABI Holdings or its designated Affiliate
pursuant to the ABI Subscription shall be equal to $158.55 per share
(converted to Pesos at the prevailing market exchange rate on the ABI
Subscription Closing Date), together with interest for the period from the
ABI Subscription Closing Date until the date of payment at LIBOR in effect on
the ABI Subscription Closing Date. ABI Holdings or its designated Affiliate
shall have the irrevocable, unconditional obligation to make payment of such
purchase price in immediately available funds to Diblo or any successor
thereof (including the Company) on or prior to the date that is six (6) months
after the ABI Subscription Closing Date.

 

(b) In the event that the ABI Subscription shall be consummated in accordance
with Section 2.10(a), the Company and Diblo shall so notify ABI Holdings in
writing and shall set forth in such writing the place and time for the closing
of the ABI Subscription (the "ABI Subscription Closing"), which shall take
place on the ABI Subscription Closing Date. At the ABI Subscription Closing,
Diblo shall cause to be issued and delivered to ABI Holdings or such
designated Affiliate, as the case may be, a certificate representing the Diblo
Series B-II Shares subscribed for by ABI Holdings or such designated
Affiliate pursuant to the ABI Subscription. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
understood and agreed that the Diblo Series B-II Shares issued and delivered
to ABI Holdings or its designated Affiliate pursuant to the ABI Subscription
shall be canceled and exchanged for shares of the capital stock of the
Company constituting a portion of the Merger Consideration upon the Effective
Time of the Merger. The Company hereby irrevocably waives any and all
preemptive rights to subscribe and pay for any Diblo Series B-II Shares
issued by Diblo in connection with the ABI Subscription.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND DIBLO_

 

Except (i) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule (with specific
reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which
the information set forth in such disclosure schedule relates ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the information in any section or paragraph of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall qualify the other Sections and subsections of this
Agreement to the extent that the relevance of such information to such other

 



25  Sections and subsections is reasonably apparent from a reading of such
information)), (ii) for any Previously-Approved Information ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that it was apparent from the face of the Previously-Approved
Information delivered, or from the discussions involving the Company directors
appointed by ABI, that such Previously-Approved Information was relevant and
responsive to the particular subsection or Section of these representations
and warranties), and (iii) for filings made prior to the date hereof with the
CNBV or the BMV for disclosure to the public since December 31, 2009 (
_provided_ , _however_ , that it was apparent from the face of such filings
that such disclosure was relevant and responsive to the particular subsection
or Section of these representations and warranties), the Company on behalf of
itself and Diblo, and Diblo on behalf of itself, hereby represent and
warrant to ABI, ABI Holdings and ABI Sub as follows:

Section 3.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of
the Company, Diblo and their respective Subsidiaries is a corporation or
other legal entity duly organized or formed, and validly existing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization or formation, except, in the case of
any Subsidiary of the Company, for any failure to be duly organized or formed
or validly existing that has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability
company power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to have such power, authority and
governmental approvals (i) has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect and
(ii) would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity to do business, and is in good standing (to
the extent applicable), in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed or in good standing as (i) has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would not reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Set
forth on Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a true, correct
and complete list of the material equity interests held by the Company in the
Joint Ventures, in which interests the Company holds valid title, free and
clear of Liens, other than any Liens created or arising under this Agreement
or under the agreements pursuant to which the Joint Ventures were created.

Section 3.02 _Company Charter Documents_. The Company has made available to
ABI complete and correct copies of the Companys Charter Documents, each as in
effect or adopted on the date hereof. The Charter Documents of the Company
and Diblo are in full force and effect. None of the Company or Diblo is in
violation of any provision of its Charter Documents, except as (i) has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

27 (d) Each Person set forth on Section 3.03(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule is, as of the date hereof, the record owner of the number of Company
Series A Shares set forth next to such Persons name on Section 3.03(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, which Company Series A Shares in the aggregate
represent all of the issued and outstanding Company Series A Shares. There
are no voting trusts, member agreements, proxies, Contracts or other
agreements or understandings in effect with respect to such Company Series A
Shares to which the Company or Diblo is a party.

such DIFA Shares in connection with the DIFA Merger. Such DIFA Shares are all
of the securities of DIFA owned, of record, by Diblo or the Company, and
neither the Company nor Diblo has any option or other right to acquire any

Except as set forth in filings made by ABI prior to the date hereof with the

Material Adverse Effect.

 



34 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by ABI, ABI Holdings and ABI
Sub do not, and the consummation by ABI, ABI Holdings and ABI Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, require any consent,

Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are necessary or
advisable so that, upon consummation of the Merger, each Subsidiary of the
Company shall continue to have at least two (2) holders of its capital stock;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with taking such actions, the
Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to,
issue or sell any shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company to
any Person that is not, directly or indirectly, a wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company or Diblo.

Section 5.03 _Access to Information_. To the extent permitted by applicable
Laws, from the date hereof until the Settlement Date and subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i)
upon reasonable notice, give ABI and its Affiliates, and their respective

(ii) furnish to ABI, its counsel, financial and tax advisors, auditors and
other authorized representatives such financial, tax and operating data

instruct the employees, counsel, financial and tax advisors, auditors and
other authorized representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
cooperate with ABI and its Affiliates in its investigation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.03 shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

encourage any effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys and other agents and advisors to,
notify ABI promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by
any of such Persons of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication by a third
party to any of such Persons that it is considering making an Acquisition
Proposal or any request for confidential information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
third party that the Company reasonably believes may be considering making, or
has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause all
such other Persons to identify the third party making, and the terms and
conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The
Company shall, and shall cause all such other Persons to, keep ABI fully
informed, on a current basis, of the status and details of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall, and shall
cause all such other Persons to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated

any such Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by
or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy all such information.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict (i)
any holder of Company Shares from considering, negotiating or accepting any
Acquisition Proposal, and nothing herein shall be construed to require any
holder of Company Shares to participate or sell Company Shares in the Offer or
through the Trust, (ii) ABI or its appointed directors of the Company from
voting against any Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) performance of the DIFA
Merger Agreement.

to considerations of attorney-client privilege), and the Company shall
consult with ABI in good faith with respect to any settlement discussions and
consider ABIs view in connection therewith.

Diblo shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and requested by ABI no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the expected date of the Closing Date
(it being understood that ABI shall make any such requests as soon as
reasonably practicable), use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
owners and officers of each such Subsidiary to make tax elections for such
Subsidiaries effective prior to the Effective Time treating such Subsidiaries
as partnerships or entities disregarded from their respective owners for
United States federal income tax purposes, including by preparing and filing
an accurate and complete Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 (it being

of the Merger Resolutions at such shareholders meetings or such shareholders
meetings are not effective, then the Company and Diblo shall use their
reasonable best efforts to call and hold a second general extraordinary
shareholders meeting to consider and vote upon the adoption of the Merger
Resolutions within thirty days following July 20, 2012.

to be done all things necessary or advisable, so that from the Effective Time
until the second anniversary of the Effective Time:

(i) Unless approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the Non-ABI
Directors, the existence of the Company shall be preserved.

(ii) Unless approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the Non-ABI

(iv) The Company shall continue to honor its obligations under any collective
bargaining agreements in effect as of the date of the Agreement (as they may

Section 6.02 shall not be amended, waived or otherwise modified prior to the
second anniversary of the Effective Time unless unanimously approved by the
Non-ABI Directors.

 



42 Section 6.03 _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period commencing at the Effective
Time and continuing until one (1) year immediately following the Effective
Time (or, if earlier, until such individual ceases to be employed by the
Company and its subsidiaries), ABI shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to provide each individual who is employed by the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") with (A)
base salary, incentive opportunities and wage rates, as applicable, no less
favorable than the base salary, incentive opportunities and wage rates
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (taking into account the value of any restricted stock units,
options, performance shares or other equity awards of the Company granted
prior to the Effective Time), if any, and (B) employee benefits under plans,
programs and arrangements that will provide benefits to each such Company
Employee that are, in the aggregate, substantially as favorable as

Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that ABI shall
not be required to cause the Company to issue any restricted stock units,
options, performance shares or other equity awards of ABI or the Company (or

respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.03, express
or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in
this Section 6.03, express or implied, shall be construed to prevent ABI from
terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any benefit plan that
ABI or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries may establish or
maintain.

 

Section 6.04 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. (a) Except as may be
required by applicable Law, ABI and the Company agree that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Settlement Date (and rights for advancement of
expenses, if any) now existing in favor of the current or former directors
or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties")
as provided in their respective Charter Documents or in any agreement shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action,
at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and the Settlement Date
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,

favorable than those in effect on the date of this Agreement for the Persons
who are covered by such policy on the date of this Agreement. If for any
reason ABI or the Company determines to discontinue such coverage 

 



43  during such six-year period, then ABI shall, or shall cause the Company to,

remainder of such six-year period that provides coverage for events occurring
prior to the Settlement Date on terms no less favorable than the coverage
provided under the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect
on the date of this Agreement for the Persons who are covered by such policy
on the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) neither ABI
nor the Company shall be required to pay more than three hundred percent
(300%) of the annual cost of the Companys current policy for the annual
premiums required to continue such directors and officers policy or for the
one-time payment to purchase such tail policy and (ii) as an alternative, ABI
or the Company may purchase a substitute policy which (A) has an effective
term of six (6) years from the Settlement Date, (B) covers those persons who
are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers insurance
policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions occurring on
or prior to the Settlement Date, and (C) contains terms and conditions that
are no less favorable to the insured than those of the Companys directors
and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof.

(c) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

(d) In the event that the Company or its successors or assigns consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing company
or entity of such consolidation or merger, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Company shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.04.

fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.04.

removed from the board of directors of the Company or from his or her
employment with the Company, the lawful actions of such individual in his or
her capacity as such shall be ratified and he or she shall be released from
all liability for such lawful actions on terms customary in Mexico and
consistent with the practice of Company prior to the Effective Time, it being
understood that in no event shall any ratification or release be made

committed a criminal offense or has engaged in any acts of fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(d) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
the knowledge of ABI, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting ABI or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. During the pendency of any
such action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding, ABI shall keep the
Company reasonably informed, on a current basis, of the status and details
thereof (to the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to
considerations of attorney-client privilege), and ABI shall consult with
the Company in good faith with respect to any settlement discussions in
connection therewith and consider the Companys view in connection therewith.

Section 6.06 _DIFA Merger Agreement_. ABI shall perform all of its obligations
under the DIFA Merger Agreement.

Company Series B Shares and Diblo Series B-II Shares at the respective general

and Diblo, as the case may be, occurring on the Shareholders Meetings Date
and shall vote all such shares in favor of the approval of the Merger
Resolutions.

 _COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES_

The parties hereto agree that:

Section 7.01 _Certain Filings_.

 

(a) The Company and ABI shall cooperate with one another (i) in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required or advisable, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Material Contracts of
the Company or ABI or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(ii) in taking such actions or making any such filings (including with the
CNBV, the BMV, the CNIE and any other Governmental Authorities), furnishing
information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any
such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. This cooperation shall include,
but shall not be limited to, any filings to be made with tax authorities or
other actions reasonably required to be taken in connection with the
maintenance and continuation of existing tax consolidation authorizations,
including the Mexican tax consolidation of the Company, and the transfer of
the tax consolidation authorization to another entity designated by ABI.

 



45 (b) ABI will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
reasonably practicable the approval to commence the Offer from the CNBV
(including updating the registration of the Companys stock with the RNV) and
all other applicable Governmental Authorities.

 

Section 7.02 _Efforts and Actions to Cause Merger and Offer to Occur_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date or the Settlement Date, as applicable, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and assist and
cooperate with the other parties and with each other in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable (subject to applicable Law) to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger and the Offer (in the case of the Merger, prior to the Termination
Date), including: (i) the preparation and filing of all filings, notices,
notifications, petitions, requests, statements, _folletos informativos_ ,
registrations and updates to registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents with Governmental Authorities (together,
"Filings") necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger and the Offer; and (ii) the taking of all such
other actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain the Required Approvals
or any other necessary or advisable consents, approvals, permits, waivers,
authorizations, qualifications, clearances, expirations or terminations of
waiting periods or non-actions (together, "Consents") from or with respect to
any Governmental Authority or other Person. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with the others in determining, including providing the other
party with any information which is reasonably necessary to determine or to
confirm, which Filings are required or advisable to be made with, and which
Consents are required or advisable to be obtained from or with respect to,
Governmental Authorities or other Persons in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (subject to any applicable
confidentiality restrictions and applicable Law, _provided_ , that any such
party so restricted shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such
information in a manner that does not violate the applicable confidentiality
restriction or applicable Law), and each party shall promptly after the date
hereof (to the extent not made prior to the date hereof) (A) make or cause to
be made all Filings required of such party in order to obtain all Required
Approvals, including under the HSR Act and the Federal Law of Economic
Competition ( _Ley Federal de Competencia Econ omica_), and in order to
obtain approval under any other applicable Antitrust Laws, (B) make or cause
to be made all Filings required to be made with the CNBV and (C) comply with
any request of any Governmental Authority in connection therewith for
additional information, documents or other materials received by such party

transactions, including participating in meetings (whether
substantive, reporting or courtesy) with officials of such Governmental
Authority during the course of its review of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) To the extent not prohibited by the relevant Governmental Authority, the
parties shall jointly participate in, and shall cooperate with each other with
respect 

 



46  to, all discussions, negotiations and other communications with all
Governmental Authorities and other Persons in connection with the Required
Approvals or Consents. Each party shall cooperate, and cause its
Representatives to cooperate, with the others and any Governmental Authority
and such other Persons in furnishing all information reasonably necessary to
obtain, or in connection with obtaining, any such Required Approval or
Consent. If any information to be furnished by one party to another party
contains confidential competitively-sensitive information, the disclosing
party may restrict the receipt of such information to the receiving partys
external counsel;  _provided_ , that to the extent reasonably practicable the
disclosing party also shall provide a redacted version of such information to
the receiving party. In connection with the actions and other matters
referenced in this Section 7.02, no party shall be required to take any
action prohibited by applicable Law. To the extent not prohibited by the
relevant Governmental Authority, without limiting the foregoing, each of the
parties shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, (i) promptly and in
reasonable detail inform the others of any written or material oral
communication received from or given to any Governmental Authority or such
other Persons, and provide the others with copies of any such
written communication, (ii) permit the others to review in advance, to the
extent practicable with reasonable time and opportunity to comment and
consider in good faith the views of the others with respect to, any proposed
submission, correspondence, Filing or other communication by any party to or
with any Governmental Authority or such other Persons, including any
submission, correspondence, Filing or other communication explaining or
defending this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or responding to any
request or objection made by any Governmental Authority or such other Persons,
(iii) provide reasonable prior notice to and, to the extent practicable,
consult with the others in advance of any meeting, material conference or
material discussion with any Governmental Authority or such other Persons and
(iv) give the others (including their outside counsel) the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings, conferences and discussions. If
reasonably requested by ABI or its Subsidiaries, and if not prohibited from
doing so by the relevant Governmental Authority, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, upon reasonable notice, cause an informed representative
thereof to attend any one or more meetings, either by phone or in person, with
ABI or its Subsidiaries before a Governmental Authority in support of
obtaining the Required Approvals. In connection with the parties obligations
under this Section 7.02(b), each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to ensure that the other parties are not prohibited by any Governmental
Authority from participating in any meetings, discussions,
negotiations, conferences or other communications with such Governmental
Authority. Without limiting the parties obligations under this Section 7.02,
other than in respect of the matters contemplated in Section 7.02(h), ABIs
decision with respect to matters relating to the Required Approvals or any
Consent of any Governmental Authority will control.

(c) In connection with this Section 7.02, each of the parties hereto shall
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to:
(i) defend any suit, action or other legal proceeding, whether judicial or
administrative, relating to or arising under any Antitrust Law challenging
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) avoid the entry
of, or have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if
necessary, any decree, order or judgment (whether preliminary, temporary or
permanent, and whether for an injunction, temporary 

 



47  restraining order, stay or otherwise) that would reasonably be expected to
restrain, prevent, materially impede, materially interfere with, or delay
beyond the Termination Date the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (iii) avoid or eliminate, or minimize the impact of, each and
every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including by using its reasonable best efforts, subject to the immediately
following sentence of this Section 7.02(c) and the provisions of Section
7.02(d), to propose, negotiate, commit to and effect any divestiture, hold
separate condition or any other undertaking, condition, remedy, restriction,
obligation, consent decree, settlement, stipulation, commitment, action or
agreement (each, a "Remedial Action"), in each case as may be required in
order to obtain any Required Approvals or other Consents of Governmental
Authorities necessary to enable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur no later than the Termination Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the immediately following proviso, it is understood and agreed that ABI (1)
shall have the right, but not the obligation, in good faith, to oppose
(through litigation, by refusing to accept or agree or consent to, or through
other lawful means) any request, attempt or demand by any Governmental
Authority or other Person for any Remedial Action with respect to any assets,
brands, brand families, trademarks or other intellectual property rights,
businesses, product lines (including production and distribution assets and
rights relating thereto), contract rights or other tangible or intangible
assets or property of ABI or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, and (2) shall have the sole discretion and authority, in good
faith and in consultation with the Company (as provided in Section 7.02(b)),
to determine and implement the strategy and timing for making any offers or
proposals for, or accepting or agreeing to, any such Remedial Action;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, but subject to the immediately following proviso, to the
extent necessary to obtain the Required Approvals and any other required
Consents of any such Governmental Authority or to otherwise take the actions
contemplated by Section 7.02(a)(ii) (with respect to Consents from any
Governmental Authority) and clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the first
sentence of this Section 7.02(c) sufficiently in advance of the Termination
Date to permit the consummation of the Merger by the Termination Date, ABI
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions (including
offering, proposing, negotiating, committing to, accepting and agreeing to
any Remedial Action) at least 90 days prior to the Termination Date (it being
understood and agreed by the Company that, subject to ABI not taking any
actions or failing to take any actions with the intention of making the
Merger or the Offer not capable of receiving the Required Approvals prior to
the Termination Date, and consulting with the Company as required hereunder,
ABI shall not be in breach of its obligations under this Agreement solely by
reason of the fact that it determines not to make offers or proposals for, or
negotiate, commit to, accept or agree to, any such Remedial Action until 90
days prior to the Termination Date); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
the foregoing proviso), in no event shall ABI, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to
accept any Remedial Actions (A) the effectiveness or consummation of which
are not conditional on the consummation of the Merger or (B) to the extent
such Remedial Actions, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to constitute a Regulatory MAE. In addition, it is understood and
agreed that ABI and its Affiliates shall not be required to, and the Company
and its Affiliates will not without the prior written consent of ABI, propose,
negotiate, commit to or effect any Remedial Action whatsoever to

 



48  obtain any Consent of any Person that is not a Governmental Authority if
such Consent is not reasonably necessary to effect a Remedial Action required
in order to obtain any Required Approvals or other Consents of Governmental
Authorities.

(d) For purposes of Section 7.02(c), except to the extent expressly waived in
writing by ABI in its sole discretion, one or more Remedial Actions shall
constitute a "Regulatory MAE" if and to the extent such Remedial Actions,
individually or in the aggregate with all other Remedial Actions taken
together, either (i) would reasonably be expected to result (after giving
effect to any net after-tax proceeds or other benefits reasonably expected to
result from any such Remedial Action) in adverse valuation effects (measured
on a net present value basis) to (A) the business, results of operations or
financial condition of (x) the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (y) ABI or its
Subsidiaries either before or after giving effect to the Merger and the Offer
or (B) any anticipated benefits (net of any costs associated with or relating
to such anticipated benefits so affected) reasonably expected to result to
ABI, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries from the Merger or the
Offer, that, in the case of (A) and (B), individually or in the aggregate
exceed $3 billion or (ii) would require ABI, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to divest, sell, dispose, assign, split
(with respect to asset, brand, brand family, trademarks or geography),
license any rights with respect to or enter into a co-existence agreement or
agreement providing for a covenant not to sue, or take or agree to other
actions, commitments or restrictions (including with respect to marketing)
with respect to any Major Brand, any Major Brand Assets or a Major Brand
Business. The following shall be deemed to constitute "Major Brands": the
Budweiser, Bud Light, Michelob, Corona or Modelo trademarks, brands or brand
families or any extension or derivative thereof reasonably considered to be
within such trademark, brand or brand family. The following shall be deemed to
constitute "Major Brand Assets": any tangible or intangible assets
or property (including trademarks, trade names, trade dress and other
intellectual property rights) and contract or other rights owned, used or held
for use by ABI, the Company, Crown JV or any of their respective Subsidiaries
primarily in connection with, or otherwise to the extent primarily relating
to, the manufacture, marketing, sale and/or distribution of any product(s)
sold under any Major Brand(s). "Major Brand Business" means: the operation of
any of the Major Brands businesses.

(e) For purposes of the definition of "Regulatory MAE", adverse valuation
effects shall include any losses, costs, fines, penalties, expenses or
damages incurred or paid in connection with, or to the extent arising from,
any Remedial Action (including any losses, costs, fines, penalties, expenses
or damages incurred or paid in connection with or to the extent arising from
(x) any current or future investigations, demands or claims against or
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries by the Mexican Federal Competition
Commission ( _Comisi on Federal de Competencia_) in respect of any actions,
or failures to act, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether prior
to or after the date hereof (the "Mexican Competition Matters") or (y) any
claim by any third party that (A) the Company, ABI or any of their respective
Subsidiaries has breached an obligation to such third party as a result of its
compliance with the requirements of a Remedial Action or (B) its consent was
required to effect a Remedial Action (in the case of clause (y), to the
extent of losses, costs, fines, penalties, expenses or damages reasonably
expected to be incurred or paid in connection

 



49  therewith, or to the extent arising therefrom)). The parties understand and
agree that a reasonable monetary estimate of qualitative effects of a Remedial
Action, including without limitation, any reputational harm, competitive
disadvantage, lost business opportunity or other qualitative harm, shall be
included, without duplication, in the determination referenced in clause (i)
of Section 7.02(d).

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that the Merger shall not have been consummated due to a Regulatory MAE under
Section 7.02(d)(i) and a material portion of the $3 billion in aggregate
adverse valuation effects giving rise to such Regulatory MAE is attributable
to Remedial Actions required by the Mexican Federal Competition Commission (
_Comisi on Federal de Competencia_) and/or is attributable to the Mexican
Competition Matters, the Termination Fee shall not be payable.

(g) Unless otherwise agreed with ABI or its Representatives, the Company and
Diblo shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that their respective
Representatives shall not communicate with Constellation or its
Representatives in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
with respect to changes or amendments or potential changes or amendments to
the Crown JV or any agreements relating thereto or any new
agreements relating thereto in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of the Company and Diblo acknowledges that ABI, solely on behalf
of itself, shall have the sole and exclusive right to discuss and negotiate
with Constellation with respect to any of the matters referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of ABI or
any of its Affiliates shall enter into any amendment or agreement with
Constellation or any of its Affiliates that could reasonably be expected to
have any impact on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or on Crown JV or
any of its Subsidiaries, or on any of their respective businesses, in the
event that the Settlement Date has not occurred (it being understood that ABI
may enter into such amendments or agreements having such an impact at or after
the Effective Time and prior to the Settlement Date with the prior written
consent of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld); 
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that, to the extent reasonably
practicable, ABI shall (i) promptly inform in reasonable detail the Company
and its Representatives of any written or material oral communication received
from or given to Constellation or its Representatives, and provide the
Company and its Representatives with copies of any such written communication,
(ii) permit the Company and its Representatives to review in advance, with
reasonable time and opportunity to comment, and consider in good faith the
views of the Company and its Representatives with respect to, any proposed
material communication by ABI or its Representatives to Constellation or its
Representatives and (iii) provide reasonable prior notice to and consult with
the Company and its Representatives in advance of any meeting, material
conference or material discussion with Constellation or its Representatives.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with ABI in
executing and consummating any agreements reached between ABI (and/or any of
its Affiliates), on the one hand, and Constellation (and/or any of its
Affiliates), on the other hand, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that in no event shall the
Company be required to execute or consummate any such agreements that will or
may become effective prior to the earlier of (x) the Settlement Date and (y)
the latest date specified by a Governmental Authority as acceptable for
purposes of meeting any conditions (including the performance of a Remedial
Action) to a Required Approval that shall permit the transactions contemplated
hereby, including 

 



50  the Merger and the Offer, to be consummated. In connection with any sale of
the membership or other interest in Crown JV, the Company shall cooperate in
making a tax election under Section 754 of the Code and execute any tax
documentation reasonably requested by ABI in connection therewith. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that any changes to the price
and economic terms of the Crown Agreements, after giving effect to the
amendments entered into as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Amended
Crown Agreements ), or any changes to the other terms of the Amended Crown
Agreements that are not material to the structure of the relationship between
or among ABI and Crown and the other parties under the Amended Crown
Agreements, shall be deemed not to be a Remedial Action for purposes of
determining whether a Regulatory MAE has occurred under clause (ii)
of Section 7.02(d) but shall be included in the determination of adverse
valuation effects for purposes of determining whether a Remedial Action
constitutes a Regulatory MAE under clause (i) of Section 7.02(d); _provided_
,  _however_ , that it is further understood and agreed that each of (A) any
change in the ownership rights in respect of (x) the Modelo or Corona Major
Brands, including the ownership of or rights in intellectual property of
Modelo or Corona or any obligation to license such Major Brands to a third
party that does not have a license on the date hereof, (y) the Major Brand
Assets of Modelo or Corona or (z) the Major Brand Business of Modelo or
Corona, and (B) any change to material non-economic terms of the structure of
the relationship between or among ABI and Crown and the other parties under
the Amended Crown Agreements, shall be deemed to be a Remedial Action for
purposes of determining whether a Regulatory MAE has occurred under clause
(ii) of Section 7.02(d).

(h) Notwithstanding the last sentence of Section 7.02(b) and ABIs rights to
determine and implement the strategy and timing for making any offers or
proposals for, or accepting or agreeing to, any Remedial Action pursuant to
Section 7.02(c), ABI hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Company, solely
on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, shall have the sole and exclusive
right to discuss and negotiate with the Governmental Authorities in Mexico
with respect to the Mexican Competition Matters and, in good faith and in
consultation with ABI (as provided in Section 7.02(b)), to determine and
implement the strategy and timing for making any offers or proposals for, or
accepting or agreeing to, any Remedial Action solely in respect the Mexican
Competition Matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent not
prohibited by the relevant Governmental Authority, the Company shall (i)
promptly inform in reasonable detail ABI and its Representatives of any
written or material oral communication relating to the Mexican Competition
Matters received from or given to the Governmental Authorities in Mexico
having jurisdiction over the Mexican Competition Matters, and provide ABI and
its Representatives with copies of any such written communication, (ii)
permit ABI to review in advance, to the extent practicable with reasonable
time and opportunity to comment and consider in good faith the views of ABI
and its Representatives with respect to, any proposed material communication
by the Company or its Representatives to such Governmental Authorities, (iii)
provide reasonable prior notice to and, to the extent practicable, consult
with ABI and its Representatives in advance of any meeting,
material conference or material discussion with such Governmental Authority
and (iv) give ABI (including its outside counsel) the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meetings, conferences or discussions. Notwithstanding
Section 5.01(j), the Company shall not settle, compromise, discharge or agree
to settle any of the Mexican Competition Matters without the prior written
consent of ABI, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



51 Section 7.03 _Financing_. (a) The Company shall provide, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Companys independent auditors, counsel and other Representatives to
provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
financing contemplated in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Financing") as may be reasonably
requested by ABI ( _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to
provide cooperation under this Section 7.03 that unreasonably interferes with
the ongoing business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or exposes the
Company or its Representatives to liability or costs not indemnified or
reimbursed by ABI), including:

 

(i) arranging for senior management of the Company (x) to meet at reasonable
times and on a reasonable number of occasions with rating agencies,
prospective lenders and investors in presentations, meetings and due diligence
sessions, (y) to provide reasonable and customary management and legal
representations to auditors and (z) to provide reasonable assistance with the
preparation of business projections and similar materials ( _provided_ that,
in the case of this clause (i), such cooperation does not unreasonably impair
the ability of such members of senior management to carry out their duties to
the Company);

(ii) otherwise reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of ABI and
its financing sources for any of the Financing;

(iii) upon reasonable request, furnishing ABI and its financing sources with
such financial and other pertinent information, including historical financial
statements for the prior completed fiscal year and any subsequent interim
period prepared in accordance with IFRS and lists of financial indebtedness
and Liens, regarding the Company as shall exist (or if not existing, using
reasonable best efforts to prepare such financial or other pertinent
information) as may be reasonably requested by ABI, including such financial
or other pertinent information as may be requested by ABI in connection with
the preparation of combined financial information on a pro forma basis;

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain reasonable and customary legal
opinions relating to the Financing as may reasonably be requested by ABI;

 

(v) using reasonable best efforts to provide and execute necessary documents
and certificates (including certificates of the chief financial officer of
any of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to financing matters), as
may be reasonably requested by ABI; and

(vi) using reasonable best efforts to cause its independent accountants to
provide assistance and cooperation with ABI, including the provision of
customary comfort letters, and in the preparation of an offering document for
the Financing and consent to inclusion of audit reports in any registration
statements and offering documents;

 



52   _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case, no obligation of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or representatives under any instrument or agreement (but excluding
opinions and certificates and any other document required to be provided prior
to drawdown of the Financing) shall be effective or be binding on the Company,
such Subsidiary or representative prior to the Settlement Date.

(b) ABI, ABI Holdings and ABI Sub hereby agree and acknowledge that the
Financing is not a condition to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.04 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and,
except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with
any applicable securities exchange, will not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, to the extent
practicable; _provided_ that following the initial public announcement of this
Agreement, each of the parties may make internal announcements to their
respective employees or further public disclosure, which it deems appropriate
in its sole judgment, including to securities analysts, institutional
investors and rating agencies and in press interviews, which, in each case,
are otherwise consistent with the parties prior public disclosures regarding
the Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 7.05 _Integration Preparation_. Subject to and to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the members of its

advisable to facilitate the integration of the activities, policies and
programs of the Company with the activities, policies and programs of ABI and
its Subsidiaries as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Settlement
Date.

Section 7.06 _Translation_. Within a period not to exceed thirty (30) days
from the date hereof, ABI and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to prepare a mutually
agreed upon translation into the Spanish language of this Agreement (including
the Annexes, Schedules and Exhibits hereto, and any other agreements entered
into in connection herewith or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby) for purposes of disclosure to Mexican authorities to the
extent required by such authorities. In the event of any conflict between such
Spanish language translations and the English version, the English version

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and ABI;

(b) by the Company or ABI if the Merger has not been consummated on or before

to be consummated by the Termination Date;

(c) by the Company or ABI if there shall be any law or regulation enacted

officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to any

other party or (2) willful and material failure of any party to perform a
covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable for any and all damages
(which, in the case of any such willful and material failure by ABI, ABI

57 Section 10.04 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 7.02(f), in the event that (i) this Agreement is
terminated by ABI or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b) or Section
10.01(c) (in the case of Section 10.01(c), as a result of any law, regulation,
judgment, injunction, order or decree based on or arising under any Antitrust
Law (other than any Antitrust Law under the Laws of Mexico)) and (ii) as of
the date of termination, (A) any of the conditions set forth in Section
8.01(a) (other than in respect of the Required Approval set forth in item 2 of
Annex A), Section 8.01(b) or Section 9.01(c) (in the case of Section 8.01(b)
or Section 9.01(c), as a result of any injunction, judgment, order, decree,
ruling, law, statute, rule, regulation or executive order in each case based
on or arising under any Antitrust Law (other than any Antitrust Law under the
Laws of Mexico)) has not been satisfied and (B) all other conditions waiveable
unilaterally by ABI set forth in Article 8 or, if termination occurs following
the Effective Time, Article 9 shall have been satisfied or waived (or, in the
case of conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on the Closing
Date, shall be capable of being satisfied on such date if such date were to
occur), then ABI Holdings shall, and ABI shall cause ABI Holdings to, pay
to the Company, acting solely as agent in accordance with Section 10.04(b) on
behalf of (x) if such termination occurs prior to the Effective Time, the
holders of Company Series A Shares and Company Series C Non-Voting Shares, or
(y) if such termination occurs following the Effective Time, the holders of
Company Series C Shares other than ABI or its Affiliates (the holders
referenced in clause (x) or (y), as applicable, the "Holders"), to be
allocated in each case on a pro rata basis as determined by the Company, a
cash termination fee equal to $650,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Termination
Fee").

(b) In the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to Section
10.04(a), ABI Holdings shall, and ABI shall cause ABI Holdings to, remit to
the Company or the Companys designee (as directed by the Company), on behalf
of the Holders and for distribution by the Company to the Holders, an amount
equal to the Termination Fee, less all Antitrust Damages (as defined below)
(the "Net Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within two Business Days of the date of termination of this Agreement. The
payment of the Net Termination Fee by ABI Holdings to the Company shall be the
sole obligation of ABI Holdings to pay the Termination Fee (and, to the
extent of ABIs obligation to cause ABI Holdings to make such payment, the
sole obligation of ABI), it being understood that no shareholder of the
Company shall have any recourse or rights against ABI, ABI Sub or ABI
Holdings with respect to the Companys actions as agent on behalf of the
Holders or the Companys obligation to distribute the Net Termination Fee or
the Termination Fee to the Holders. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, no portion of the Termination Fee shall
become payable while the Company, any of the Holders or Diblo pursues a claim
in respect of one or more breaches by ABI, ABI Holdings or ABI Sub of any of
their respective covenants or agreements contained in Section 7.02 or any
other obligation or provision in this Agreement to the extent such other
obligation or provision relates to Antitrust Law matters (an "Antitrust
Claim"), until such litigation shall have been finally resolved by a final,
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or mutually
satisfactory release with prejudice of any and all claims. The amount of the
Termination Fee shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (x) the
percentage of the total outstanding capital stock of the Company represented
by the Company Shares, multiplied by (y) the sum of all amounts paid or
payable by ABI, ABI Sub or ABI Holdings in respect of any such Antitrust
Claim (including any interest or penalties) (such product, the "Antitrust

 



58  Damages"). The Company shall receive and hold the Termination Fee or the Net
Termination Fee, as applicable, as agent on behalf of the Holders. Within five
Business Days of receipt by the Company or the Companys designee of the
Termination Fee or the Net Termination Fee, the Company shall, or shall cause
such designee to, pay the Termination Fee or the Net Termination Fee, as the
case may be, on a pro rata basis as determined by the Company, to the Holders
of record of Company Series A Shares and Company Series C Non-Voting Shares,
or, if the termination of this Agreement occurs following the Effective Time,
the Holders of Company Series C Shares other than ABI or its Affiliates, in
each case as of the open of business in Mexico City, Mexico on the date of the
Companys public announcement of the termination of this Agreement, it being
understood that each such Holder and not the Company shall be responsible for
the payment of any applicable taxes in connection with the receipt by such
Holder of his or her pro rata allocation of the Termination Fee or the Net
Termination Fee.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
written acceptance by the Company of the payment by ABI Holdings of the
Termination Fee or the Net Termination Fee shall be deemed to be an
irrevocable waiver by the Company, on behalf of itself and all of its
shareholders, and Diblo of any and all Antitrust Claims against ABI, ABI Sub
and ABI Holdings, and shall extinguish any right of the Company, on behalf of
itself and its shareholders, and Diblo to sue or pursue any such Antitrust
Claim against any of ABI, ABI Sub and ABI Holdings, and in such event the
Company and Diblo shall terminate with prejudice any pending litigation
pursuing any such Antitrust Claim commenced prior to accepting the Termination
Fee or the Net Termination Fee (it being understood that the failure by the
Company to return the Termination Fee or the Net Termination Fee, as
applicable, to ABI Holdings within five (5) Business Days of payment to the
Company thereof shall be deemed to be a written acceptance of the Termination
Fee or the Net Termination Fee, as the case may be, for purposes of
this Section 10.04(c)); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section
10.04(c) shall limit or affect in any way the ability of the Company to accept
the Net Termination Fee and enforce, prior to the payment of the
Termination Fee or Net Termination Fee, as the case may be, any judgment
obtained against ABI, ABI Holdings or ABI Sub or settlement entered into with
ABI, ABI Holdings or ABI Sub following the final resolution of litigation
relating to any Antitrust Claim as contemplated in Section 10.04(b).

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Company shall have the sole and
exclusive right, on behalf of the Holders, to enforce the obligation of ABI
and ABI Holdings to pay the Termination Fee (including the Net Termination
Fee) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement through any suit, action
or other legal proceeding. In exchange for the right to receive its portion
of the Termination Fee or the Net Termination Fee as provided herein, each
Holder shall be deemed to have agreed that the Company shall be appointed,
authorized and empowered, on behalf of such Holder, to act as sole and
exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact, under any and all applicable Laws, with
the sole and exclusive right to enforce (whether through any suit, action or
proceeding for specific performance or any other remedy at law or in equity)
on behalf of such Holder ABIs or ABI Holdings obligation to pay the
Termination Fee or the Net Termination Fee, as the case may be, in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement (including the right to refrain from
enforcing such obligation on behalf of such Holder) and to take any and all
actions that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Company in
its

 



59  sole discretion, in connection therewith, and each such Holder shall be
deemed to have waived any right to enforce such obligation with respect to the
Termination Fee or the Net Termination Fee, as the case may be, individually.
Without prejudice to the Companys right to obtain an injunction or specific
performance of this Agreement or any other remedy to which it is entitled at
law or in equity, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in the event
that any suit, action or other proceeding is brought by the Company alleging
any Antitrust Claim, the amount of the Termination Fee, to the extent already
paid to the shareholders pursuant to this Section 10.04, shall be credited
against any Antitrust Damages that the shareholders of the Company may be
entitled to receive.

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.04 are an integral part of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, the Company would not
have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if ABI or ABI Holdings fails
promptly to pay the Termination Fee or the Net Termination Fee when due
pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 10.04 and, in order to obtain
such payment, the Company commences a suit, action or other proceeding that
results in a judgment against ABI or ABI Holdings directing it to pay such
Termination Fee or Net Termination Fee, or if payment of any portion of the
Termination Fee is deferred pursuant to Section 10.04(b) while litigation is
ongoing, ABI and ABI Holdings, as applicable, shall pay to the Company the
amount of the Termination Fee together with interest on the amount of the
Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of receipt of payment by the Company at LIBOR in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. In no event shall the Termination Fee
referred to in this Section 10.04 be paid (i) on more than one occasion or
(ii) following an exercise by the Company of its call option held in relation
to Crown JV set forth Section 12.8 or 12.9 of the Crown JV Agreement (x) in
violation of Section 5.01(g) or Section 5.01(h) or (y) if such exercise shall
have materially contributed to the failure to obtain the Required Approval set
forth in item 2 of Annex A. ABI and ABI Holdings obligation to pay the
Termination Fee shall survive the termination of this Agreement, subject
to the terms and conditions hereof.

Section 10.05 _Limitation on Claims and Damages_. (a) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the parties hereto shall not be liable for monetary
damages for breach of, or failure to comply with, any of their obligations
under Section 7.02 of this Agreement, or any other obligation or provision in
this Agreement to the extent such other obligation or provision relates to
Antitrust Law matters, whether such claim is brought prior to or following
termination of this Agreement, except to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction has determined in a final and non-appealable judgment that there
has been a willful and material breach by such party of or willful and
material failure by such party to comply with its obligations under Section
7.02 of this Agreement or such other obligation or provision. In the event
that a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment that there has been a willful and material breach by ABI,
ABI Holdings or ABI Sub of or willful and material failure by ABI,
ABI Holdings or ABI Sub to comply with its obligations under Section 7.02 of
this Agreement or such other obligation or provision, the parties acknowledge
and agree that the damages resulting from any such breach or failure to comply
shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and
may include to the extent proven claims for damages based on loss of the
economic benefits of the transaction to the Companys stockholders, which
shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company.

 



60 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, and subject to the
provisions of Section 10.02, neither of the Company or Diblo shall be liable
for any amount of damages for inaccuracy or breach of, or failure to comply
with, any of their representations and warranties contained in Section 3.10(b)
or their obligations under Section 5.01(e) of this Agreement to the extent
such damages would exceed in the aggregate the amount by which any dividends
paid to the shareholders of the Company in accordance with Section 5.01(d)
were increased as a result of such breach or failure to comply, together with
interest thereon at LIBOR from the date such dividend was declared, whether
such claim is brought prior to or following termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.06 _Certain Expenses_. In the event of a breach by ABI of Section
6.07 of this Agreement and a failure of the Merger Resolutions to be adopted,
ABI agrees that it will reimburse the Company for all of the Transaction
Expenses. "Transaction Expenses" shall mean all reasonable, documented, out-
of-pocket fees and expenses of the Company, including without limitation,
reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel, accountants, and other
consultants and advisors incurred in connection with the evaluation,
structuring, preparation and negotiation of documents and due diligence
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, UNITED STATES

Agreement and the Merger Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated

hereto. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
