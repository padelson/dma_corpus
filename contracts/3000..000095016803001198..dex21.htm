shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Airborne Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Airborne Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as DHL and the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Airborne Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of an Airborne
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Airborne Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing that
number of whole  



 

13  shares of Airco Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.6_ , if any, and (B) a check in the
amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholding) of the Cash
Consideration that the holder is entitled to receive under _Section 2.6_ , and
the Airborne Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be canceled.
No interest will be paid or accrued with respect to any Merger Consideration
deliverable upon due surrender of the Airborne Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Airborne Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of Airborne, payment may be made to a transferee if, and
only if, the Airborne Certificate representing such Airborne Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.8_ , each Airborne Certificate (other than Airborne Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time for all purposes to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right
to receive in respect of such Airborne Certificate pursuant to this
_Article II_. In the case of Airborne Certificates representing Dissenting
Shares, each Airborne Certificate representing Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time for all purposes to represent only
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the
DGCL.



(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Airborne Common Stock; Transfer
Books_. The payment of the Merger Consideration upon the surrender for
exchange of shares of Airborne Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been issued and made in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Airborne Common Stock, and (except
with respect to Dissenting Shares) following the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Airborne Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Airborne Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Section
2.8_ , subject to applicable law in the case of Airborne Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares. From and after the Effective Time, holders of
Airborne Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of
Airborne, except as provided by law.



(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Airborne
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then payment shall be
made in accordance with this _Section 2.8_ in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Airborne Certificates, upon the delivery to the Exchange Agent of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Airborne Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and an indemnity in form reasonably satisfactory
to DHL (and, if required by DHL, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as DHL may direct, as an indemnity) against any claim that
may be made against the Exchange Agent or DHL or otherwise with respect to
such Airborne Certificate.



(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ that
remains undistributed to holders of Airborne Certificates for one (1) year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to DHL, upon
demand, and any holders of Airborne Certificates who have not theretofore
complied with this _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter only look to DHL for payment
of the Cash Consideration portion of their claim. Any portion of the Exchange
Shares made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.8_
that remains undistributed to holders of Airborne Certificates for one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to
Airco, upon the demand of DHL or the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of
Airborne Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Section
2.8_ shall thereafter only look to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
the Stock Consideration portion of their claim. If, after the Exchange Shares
have been returned to Airco, additional Exchange Shares are required for
exchange hereunder, then Airco shall make available to the Surviving
Corporation additional shares of Airco Common Stock for exchange hereunder
(and Airco shall, and Airborne shall cause Airco to, agree pursuant to the
Separation Agreement to (i) promptly make such additional Exchange Shares
available to the Surviving Corporation upon its request and (ii) indemnify and
hold harmless the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates for any damages or
losses the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates may suffer as a
result of Aircos failure to promptly provide such shares).



 

14 (h) _No Liability_. Neither DHL, Airborne, the Surviving Corporation,
Airco nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Airborne Common Stock for any stock or cash held by DHL, the Surviving
Corporation, Airco or the Exchange Agent for payment pursuant to this _Section
2.8_ properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 



(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by DHL; _provided_ that such investment shall be in
(i) securities issued or directly and fully guaranteed or insured by the
Unites States of America government or any agency or instrumentality thereof,
(ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or
(iii) certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances and overnight bank
deposits with any commercial bank, depository institution or trust company
incorporated or doing business under the laws of the United States of America,
any state thereof or the District of Columbia. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to DHL.



(j) _Withholding Rights_. DHL, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Airborne Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under
any provision of any state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by DHL, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Airborne Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made by DHL, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.



Section 2.9 __ _Stock Options_ __.



(a) Each holder of an outstanding and unexercised stock option (the
_"Airborne Stock Options_ _"_ ) under the Airborne Option Plans, whether or
not vested or exercisable, shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time
(i) from DHL, an amount in cash (net of any applicable withholding taxes)
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Airborne Common Stock
previously subject to the Airborne Stock Option and (B) the excess of the per
share amount of cash to be paid in the Merger over the exercise price per
share of Airborne Common Stock previously subject to the Airborne Stock
Option, and (ii) subject to paying cash in lieu of fractional shares under
_Section 2.9(b)_ , if any shares of Airco Common Stock are being issued as
part of the Merger Consideration, the Stock Consideration (net of any
applicable withholding taxes) receivable in respect of the shares of Airco
Common Stock as were previously subject to such holders Airborne Stock
Options; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any Stock Option that has an exercise
price per share of Airborne Common Stock that is equal to or greater than the
per share amount of cash to be paid in the Merger shall be canceled in full
without any payment in respect thereof; and _provided, further,_ that at and
after the Effective Time all Airborne Stock Options shall be canceled in full,
and no Airborne Stock Options shall be exercisable, whether for shares of
Airborne Common Stock, shares of Airco Common Stock or shares of DHL common
stock.



(b)  _No Fractional Shares. _Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no certificates or scrip or shares of Airco Common Stock
representing fractional shares of Airco Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the conversion of the Airborne Stock Options, and such
fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a
stockholder of Airco or a holder of shares of Airco Common Stock. In lieu of
any such fractional interests, each holder of Airborne Stock Options
exchanged pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_ who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Airco Common Stock shall receive cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional
part of a share of Airco Common Stock multiplied by (ii) $0.40. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify DHL,
and DHL shall deposit such amounts with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interest
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.



 

15 Section 2.10 _Closing_. Unless the transactions herein contemplated
have been abandoned and this Agreement terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_ ,

Date_ _"_ ), unless otherwise provided by the mutual agreement, in writing, of
Airborne, DHL and Acquisition; _provided_ that if, at July 25, 2003, or such
other time as all of the closing conditions set forth in _Articles VI_ ,
_VII_ and _VIII_ have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions
that, by the express terms thereof, are not capable of being satisfied until
the Effective Time), the Parties have not received the DOT Approval, then DHL

Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification_.



(a) Airborne and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization (except, in the case of good standing, for
entities organized under the laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize
such concept) and has all requisite corporate, partnership or other similar
powers to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as currently conducted, other than such exceptions as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
Airborne and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation or other foreign legal entity and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary (except,
in the case of good standing, for entities organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept), with such exceptions as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Complete and correct copies of the articles or
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other similar organizational
documents, all as amended to date, have been delivered or made available to
DHL. Such articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws are in full
force and effect as of the date hereof and no other organizational documents
are applicable to or binding upon Airborne. _Schedule 3.1_ sets forth (i) a
list of all Subsidiaries of Airborne and their respective jurisdictions of
organization, identifies Airbornes direct or indirect percentage ownership
or equity interest therein and, to the Knowledge of Airborne, identifies all
Persons other than Airborne who have any ownership or equity interests
therein, together with such Persons percentage interest, and (ii) a list of
all of the Persons in which Airborne or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
through SERP or any deferred compensation plan listed on _Schedule 3.18(a)_ )
own or have the right or obligation to acquire voting securities or any other
ownership interests (the _"_ _Investment Interests_ _"_ ). Except for Liens
created under the express terms of any Indebtedness set forth on _Schedule
3.4_ , such Investment Interests are owned free and clear of any and all
Liens, other than Permitted Liens.



(b) At the Effective Time, Airco will be a corporation duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and will
have all requisite corporate or other similar powers required to own, lease

exceptions as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Airco will, at the consummation of the
Separation, be duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation or other foreign legal entity and be in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, with such exceptions as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Copies of (i) the certificate of incorporation for
Airco and (ii) the bylaws for Airco that, in each case, will  



 

16  be in effect at the time of the Separation and the Effective Time are
attached hereto as _Exhibits M_ and _N_ , respectively. Such certificates of

be as of the Effective Time (in the case of Airco) duly authorized by each of
Airborne and Airco, and assuming the receipt of all consents of third parties

of either Airborne or Airco are necessary to authorize the Transaction
Agreements or to consummate the transaction so contemplated (other than, with
respect to actions required to be taken by Airborne or Airco to consummate the
Separation as contemplated by the Separation Agreement and the other related
Transaction Agreements or with respect to the Merger, obtaining the Airborne
Stockholders  Approval). This Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
to which either Airborne or Airco is a party constitute (or will upon
execution constitute) the legally valid and binding agreement of Airborne and
Airco, as the case may be (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which DHL or
Acquisition are parties, by DHL and Acquisition), enforceable against Airborne
and Airco, as the case may be, in accordance with their respective terms,
except as the same may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws affecting

Airco to, prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement (in which

will include an explanation that a vote to approve the Merger and adopt the
Merger Agreement will constitute approval of the Merger, regardless of whether

best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the

this regard. Airborne will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is

thereof and the respective regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) the
Securities Act, (iii) the rules and regulations of The New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. and the Pacific Exchange, Inc., and (iv) the DGCL.

and advise one another of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement and the Registration Statement received from the SEC. The Parties
will cooperate in preparing and filing with the SEC any necessary amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement. Neither
the Proxy Statement nor the Registration Statement shall initially be filed
with the SEC, and no amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
Registration Statement shall be filed with the SEC, without the approval of
both DHL and Airborne, which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Notwithstanding the forgoing, but without limiting any provision of
_Section 5.5_ or _Article IX_ , in the event that an Acquisition Proposal has
been made and continues to be pending, Airborne shall have the right to file
of any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or Registration
Statement that addresses such Acquisition Proposal without DHLs prior
consent.



(d) If, at any time after the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement and
prior to the Airborne Stockholders Meeting, any event should occur that
results in the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement  



 

36  containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, or that otherwise should be described in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement Airborne,
Airco and DHL shall promptly notify each other of the occurrence of such
event and then promptly prepare, file and clear with the SEC such amendment or
supplement and Airborne shall, as may be required by the SEC, mail to its
stockholders each such amendment or supplement.

anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither DHL, any of DHLs
Subsidiaries nor Airborne shall be required to or shall agree (and Airborne
shall cause Airco not to agree) to any prohibition, limitation or other
requirements that would (A) adversely affect any rights or obligations of such
Party or the Surviving Corporation under the Transaction Agreements in
a manner which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to the assets, liabilities, business,
results of operations, or condition (financial or otherwise) of such Party or
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B)
materially impair the ability of such Party or the Surviving Corporation to
conduct its business as currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted
by the Transaction Agreements.

each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) consult with each other in advance to the extent practicable of any
meeting or conference with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental

other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other Parties the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences, and
(iv) prevent or contest the imposition of any judgment, injunction, order or
decree of any Governmental Authority seeking to enjoin, restrain or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by any of the Transaction
Agreements. __

for and shall cause a meeting of its stockholders to be duly called and held
as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting on the approval
and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the related transactions (such
meeting, the _"Airborne Stockholders  Meeting"_). In connection with the
Airborne Stockholders Meeting, Airborne, acting through its board of
directors, will, subject to _Section_ _5.5(c)_ , (i) recommend the approval
and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions  



 

37  contemplated hereby, (ii) use all reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary
approvals by its stockholders of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) otherwise comply with all Legal
Requirements applicable to such meeting.



(b) Unless this Agreement is previously terminated in accordance with
_Article IX_ , Airborne shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders at
the Airborne Stockholders Meeting even if the board of directors of Airborne
determines at any time after the date hereof that the Merger is no longer
advisable or recommends that Airborne stockholders reject this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 5.5 _No Solicitation_.



(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
or the Termination Date, Airborne will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and the officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants or other agents, advisors or representatives
(collectively, the _"Representatives_ ") of Airborne or any of its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly: 



(i) solicit, initiate or encourage any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry for
an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry; 



(ii) disclose any non-public information relating to Airborne or any of its
Subsidiaries, or their businesses, assets, liabilities or prospects or afford
access to the properties, books or records of Airborne or any of its
Subsidiaries to, any Person who has made or may reasonably be expected to make
an inquiry regarding an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal; or



(iii) otherwise take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission
of any inquiry regarding an Acquisition proposal or any Acquisition Proposal
or, subject to clause (c) below, agree to recommend or accept an Acquisition
Proposal;



 _provided_ that, prior to obtaining the Airborne Stockholders Approval,
Airborne may negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, and furnish
non-public information relating to Airborne or any of its Subsidiaries, or
their businesses, assets, liabilities or prospects or afford access to the
properties, books or records of Airborne or any of its Subsidiaries to, any
Person (other than DHL or any other controlled Affiliate of Deutsche Post, AG)
(a _"Third Party_ ") who delivers an unsolicited written _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal that the board of directors of Airborne determines in
good faith could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal if and
only to the extent that (A) Airborne has complied with the terms of this
_Section 5.5_ , including the requirement in _Section 5.5(b)_ that it notify
DHL of its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry regarding an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) Airborne simultaneously provides to DHL any non-
public information to be furnished to the Third Party, (C) the board of
directors of Airborne determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of
Airbornes outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable laws and (D)
prior to furnishing information to, requesting information from, or engaging
in negotiations or discussions with the Third Party, the Third Party executes
a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable in the aggregate to
Airborne than those contained in the confidentiality agreement, dated as of
April 11, 2001, as amended, by and between DHL and Airborne (the
_"Confidentiality Agreement_ _"_ ).



 _"Superior Proposal"_ means any _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal from a Third Party that is for more than fifty percent (50%) of the
voting power of Airborne or all or substantially all of the assets of Airborne
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which a majority of the entire
board of directors of Airborne determines in good faith (on the basis of the
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and after
receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel), taking into account the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal and the likelihood and timing
of consummation (including the financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects
of the Acquisition Proposal deemed relevant by the board of directors of
Airborne in good faith), would result in a transaction that is superior from a
financial point of view to Airbornes stockholders than the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, including any proposed alterations of the terms of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements proposed by DHL in response to such
Superior Proposal.



 

38 (b) Airborne will notify DHL and Acquisition promptly (but in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by Airborne (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry regarding an
Acquisition Proposal, or of any request for non-public information relating to
Airborne or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or
records of Airborne or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person. Airborne
shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Person
making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, indication or request, and shall keep DHL fully informed,
on a current basis (but in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours),
of any material developments or changes thereto. Airborne shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all
activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Persons conducted
prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.



(c) Neither the board of directors of Airborne nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to DHL, or publicly
propose to withdraw or so modify or qualify, the Airborne Board
Recommendation, (ii) recommend, endorse or approve or publicly propose to
recommend, endorse or approve any Acquisition Proposal or the approval
or adoption thereof, (iii) cause or permit Airborne to enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement or
understanding constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (excluding
a confidentiality agreement permitted under _Section 5.5(a)_ ) or (iv) agree
or resolve to take any of the actions prohibited by the preceding clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) (any action under clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), a
_"Prohibited Action_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the
Airborne Stockholders Approval, Airborne shall be permitted to take any of
the actions prohibited by clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the preceding
sentence and terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ ,
if and only if (A) Airborne has complied with the terms of this _Section 5.5_
(except for any failure to comply that would not adversely affect the rights
of DHL under this _Section 5.5_ ), (B) an unsolicited Superior Proposal shall
have been proposed by any Third Party and such Superior Proposal is pending at
the time the Board of Directors determines to take any such action (and such
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking
into account any modifications proposed by DHL during the notice period
referred to in clause (D) below), (C) the board of directors of
Airborne determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of Airbornes
outside counsel, that a failure to take such action would constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (D) Airborne shall have
delivered to DHL a prior written notice advising DHL that it intends to take
such action and describing its reasons for taking such action (such notice to
be delivered not less than four (4) Business Days prior to the time such
action is taken); _provided_ that during any such period, Airborne and Airco
shall be obligated to consider in good faith any modifications or alternatives
to this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements proposed by DHL or
Acquisition to result in an equivalent or superior proposal. 



(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall prevent the board of
directors of Airborne from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of
Airborne a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party
to the extent required by Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 5.5(d)_ shall affect the obligations
of Airborne or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the boards of directors or
any committees thereof under _Section 5.4_ or this  _Section 5.5_.



Section 5.6 _Best Efforts; Consents_.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including
(i) the obtaining of any necessary consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Authority and/or any other public
or private third party which is required to be obtained by such Party or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ that Airborne shall not pay
or agree to pay any material amount or agree to any other material liability
or  



 

39  obligation to obtain a consent without the prior written approval of DHL)
and the making or obtaining of all necessary filings and registrations with
respect thereto, (ii) the defending of any of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings before any Governmental Authority seeking to enjoin, restrain or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by any of
the Transaction Agreements and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, and subject to _Section 5.12(a)_ , neither DHL, Acquisition nor
Airborne shall be required to or shall agree (and Airborne shall cause Airco
not to agree) to any prohibition, limitation or other requirements that would
(A) adversely affect any rights or obligations of such Party or the Surviving
Corporation under the Transaction Agreements in a manner which, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to
the assets, liabilities, business, results of operations, or condition
(financial or otherwise) of such Party or the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) materially impair the ability of
such Party or the Surviving Corporation to conduct its business as currently
conducted or as contemplated to be conducted by the Transaction Agreements.

Affiliates in doing, all things reasonably requested by DHL as being
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Authority and/or any other
public or private third party which will enable DHL to take possession of and
operate the business and properties of Airborne from and after the Effective
Time with as little disruption as possible ( _provided_ that Airborne shall
not pay or agree to pay any material amount or agree to any other material
liability or obligation to obtain a consent without the prior written
approval of DHL), including (i) having the Surviving Corporation registered in
good standing by the DOT as a foreign freight forwarder, (ii) making or
obtaining of all necessary filings and registrations with respect thereto and
(iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the foregoing.



Section 5.7 _Interim Financial Statements; Access to Information;
Notification of Certain Matters_.



(a) For each fiscal month, quarter and year ending between the date of this

its Subsidiaries within forty-five (45) days after the end of each fiscal

Airborne shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish as
promptly as practicable to DHL such information concerning Airbornes and its
Subsidiaries businesses, properties, financial condition, operations and
personnel as DHL may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ that
Airborne may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any law, rule
or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to Airborne or its
Subsidiaries requires that Airborne or its Subsidiaries restrict access to any
properties or information. Any such investigation by DHL shall not affect
the representations or warranties of Airborne contained in this Agreement.
DHL will hold any information provided under this _Section 5.7_ in confidence
to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.



(c) Airborne shall provide, as they become available on or after the date

Section 5.8 _Employee Benefits_.



(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, DHL
shall provide, or shall require the Surviving Corporation to provide, active
employees of the Surviving Corporation with employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided by Airborne or its Subsidiaries
to such employees under the Benefit Plans as of the Effective Time, after
giving effect to the Employee Matters Agreement; _provided_ that in no event
shall DHL, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates be obligated
to continue, provide or otherwise take into account any Benefit Plan that
relates to equity interests or that is an equity-based arrangement, any
benefits provided under any change-in-control or parachute agreement, and any
benefits provided with respect to any non-qualified deferred compensation plan
or supplemental retirement plan; and _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing
herein shall be construed to mean that DHL, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates cannot amend or terminate any particular Benefit Plan or
any other employee benefit, compensation or incentive plan, policy or
arrangement so long as the requirements of this _Section 5.8_ and applicable
law are otherwise satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
active employees of the Surviving Corporation who were participants in the
Airborne Express Supplement Executive Retirement Plan, as amended as of August
15, 2001 (the _"SERP_ _"_ ) (or a substantially comparable substitute), as of
the Effective Time, after giving effect to the Employee Matters Agreement,
DHL shall maintain the SERP (or, with respect to any such participant, shall
maintain a substitute plan providing benefits no less favorable in all
respects than the benefits such participant would have received under the
SERP) at least until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2007 or (ii) the date
that such current participants are no longer employees of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates, with no amendment that would affect
benefits accrued as of the Effective Time, the rate of future benefit
accruals, forms and timing of payment or methods of calculating benefits with
respect to any such participant without such participants consent. Nothing in
the foregoing shall be construed to cancel or impair existing contractual
obligations of Airborne or its Subsidiaries to any Airborne Employee in effect
at the Effective Time.



(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of DHL in which the
employees of the Surviving Corporation participate subsequent to the
Effective Time, DHL shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i)
waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions applicable to
such employees to the same extent such exclusions would have been waived
under the Benefit Plans in which such employees were participating immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) recognize all service of the employees
of Airborne or its Subsidiaries with such entity for purposes of eligibility
to participate and vesting under any employee benefit plan of DHL in which
such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the
same extent taken into account under the Benefit Plans in which
such employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.





 

41 (c) From and after the date hereof and through the Effective Date: (i)
neither Airborne, any of its Subsidiaries nor any member of their respective
Controlled Group will take any action that will cause any of them to incur any
material withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA; and (ii) Airborne shall

Subsidiaries or any member of their respective Controlled Group that any of
them would have a material withdrawal liability if they were to withdraw from

from and after the date hereof no additional shares shall be issuable or
awarded under either such plan, whether for shares of Airborne Common Stock,
shares of Airco Common Stock or shares of DHL common stock.



(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Person any right to
continued employment with DHL, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of DHL, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to terminate the employment
or services of any Person at any time following the Effective Date, with or
without cause, or to restrict any of DHL, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates in modifying any of the terms and conditions of the
employment or service relationship of any Person following the Effective
Date. Except as set forth in _Section 5.10_ , nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, shall confer upon any Airborne Employee (or any of their
respective beneficiaries or alternate payees) any rights or remedies under or
by reason of this Agreement.



Section 5.9 _Control of Other Party s Business. _Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give DHL or Acquisition, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct Airbornes operations prior to the Effective Time.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Airborne, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct DHLs or Acquisitions operations
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Parties
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over their respective operations.



Section 5.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.



(a) The Surviving Corporation shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless all
past and present directors, officers and employees (in all of their
capacities) of Airborne and its Subsidiaries (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, includes Airco up until the Effective Time) (such Persons, the
_"Indemnified Parties_ _"_ ) (A) to the same extent such Persons are
indemnified as of the date hereof (or, in the case of Airco, as they would
have be so entitled pursuant to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
attached as Exhibits hereto if such documents were in effect) by Airborne
pursuant to Airbornes or any Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation and
bylaws as in existence on the date hereof and (B) without limitation to clause
(A), to the fullest extent permitted by law, for any reasonable costs or
expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses to the
fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action, in
each case arising out of, relating to or in connection with acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time (including
for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), so
long as such Person gives the Surviving Corporation the opportunity to defend
any such Action and does not effect any settlement without the Surviving
Corporations prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and (ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in
the Surviving Corporations (or any successors) certificate of incorporation
and bylaws after the Effective Time, provision regarding the elimination of
liability of directors and the indemnification of the Indemnified Parties
which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the current
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Airborne.



 

42 (b) DHL and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained for a
period of at least six (6) years after the Effective Time coverage under
Airbornes directors and officers liability insurance policies as in effect
on the date hereof for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
( _"D andO Insurance_ _"_ ); _provided_ that (A) DHL may substitute therefor
policies with a reputable insurer of comparable credit quality of
substantially similar coverage and amounts containing terms no less
advantageous in the aggregate to the Indemnified Parties, (B) if the existing
DandO Insurance expires or is canceled during such period, DHL and
the Surviving Corporation will use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain substantially similar DandO Insurance from a reputable insurer of
comparable credit quality, (C) in no event shall DHL or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend more than 250% of the last annual premiums
paid by Airborne immediately prior to the Effective Time (the _"Maximum
Premium Amount_ _"_ ) to maintain or procure DandO Insurance pursuant to this
_Section 5.10_ and (D) if the annual premiums of such DandO Insurance would
exceed the Maximum Premium Amount, DHL or the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage reasonably available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum Premium Amount. 



(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall survive consummation of
the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified
Parties.



(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in either case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or such other entity that after (i) or (ii) conducts the
greater part of the United States air express business of DHL, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations in this _Section 5.10_.



(e) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified
Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.10_.



(f) Prior to the Effective Time, Airborne may renew or replace its existing
DandO Insurance with policies that provide substantially similar coverage for a
one (1) year period on such commercially reasonable terms as are available in
the market for someone similarly situated to Airborne; _provided_ that, if
such insurance is not available on commercially reasonable terms for a one
year period, Airborne may obtain coverage for a period of up to two (2)
years.



Section 5.11 _Financing_.

conjunction with the obtaining of any such financing, Airborne agrees, at the
reasonable request of DHL, to call for prepayment or redemption, or to prepay
or redeem, or to attempt to renegotiate the terms of, any then existing
Indebtedness of Airborne or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that no such
prepayment or redemption or call for prepayment or redemption or renegotiated

required to incur any  



 

43  liability in respect of any such prepayment or redemption or call therefor
or renegotiation thereof) prior to the Effective Time. DHL shall indemnify
and hold harmless Airborne, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective

damage and expense whatsoever incurred by such Person as a result of their
participation in such financing effort; _provided_ that DHL shall not be
obligated to indemnify and hold harmless any Person for any loss, liability,
claim, damage and expense caused by or arising out of (i) any untrue

Facility to facilitate such repayment.



(f) _ Aircraft Leases_. The Parties agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to seek any necessary consents from the respective lessors
under the Aircraft Leases due to the change of control of Airco and to release
Airborne and Airborne Express, Inc. from the guarantees relating thereto. If
the lessors under the Aircraft Leases will not consent to the release of

Corporation and Airborne Express shall remain obligated under such
guarantees.

documents or materials required to be filed with the DOT by them or by any
other Person as a result of the Merger and the Separation and, in each case,
to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested by the DOT and to use its best
efforts to obtain the DOT Approval as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither DHL, Acquisition nor
Airborne shall be required to or shall agree (and Airborne shall cause Airco
not to agree) to any changes to the Transaction Agreements in connection with
the Parties efforts to obtain the DOT Approval unless (i) such changes,
individually and in the aggregate, are commercially reasonable from the
perspective of the Surviving Corporation and Airco or (ii) DHL so requests in
writing and the requested changes, individually and in the aggregate, are
commercially reasonable from the perspective of Airco.



(b) Each of the Parties shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in
_Section 5.12(a)_ , use its best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects
with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by

communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the DOT
and of any material communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) consult with each other in advance
to the extent practicable of any meeting or conference with the DOT or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and
to the extent permitted by the DOT or other Person, give the other Parties
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.



(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the failure to
obtain the DOT Approval (and the likely effects thereof), in and of itself,
shall not (i) constitute a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) be the basis for the
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant, (iii) except as expressly
provided herein, be a condition to the Parties obligations to consummate the
Merger or effect the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements
or (iv) except as expressly provided herein, provide grounds for terminating
any of the Transaction Agreements.



(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in the event a
Legal Prohibition has been issued or obtained by the DOT or otherwise arises
under Title 49 prior to the End Date, DHL shall use its best efforts to have
any such Legal Prohibition removed, including by proposing to the appropriate
Governmental Authority to pay the Alternative Consideration in lieu of the
Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration and to take such other actions as
are consistent therewith to the extent necessary to remove such
Legal Prohibition, including doing or permitting Airborne or Airco to do any
of the following: making any required filings, withdrawing any pending
applications, including for any foreign freight forwarder license for the
Surviving Corporation,  



 

45  surrendering any authorities and otherwise acting to permit DHL to lawfully
own the assets and properties of Airborne and Airco after the Effective Time
(the _"Remedial Actions_ _"_ ). In the event that such a proposal is
sufficient to remove or avoid such Legal Prohibition, DHL shall take all
actions necessary to consummate the Merger and pay the
Alternative Consideration in lieu of the Cash Consideration and Stock
Consideration and shall take such other actions as are consistent therewith to
the extent necessary to remove such Legal Prohibition, including taking, or
permitting Airborne or Airco to take, any of the Remedial Actions.



(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that _Section 5.12(d)_ is intended to
provide an allocation of risk among the parties, and that DHL has accepted

the DOT or any other Governmental Authority.



Section 5.13 _The Separation_. __



(a) Airborne will, and will cause all of its appropriate Subsidiaries to,
use their best efforts to take all steps to be prepared to consummate the
Separation in accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. DHL will cause DHL Holdings (USA),
Inc. to make the Loan (as defined in the Separation Agreement) to Airco as
provided in the Separation Agreement.



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, DHL shall have the right from time to time
to review the Schedules to the Separation Agreement and the supporting
information. In connection with any such review, Airborne shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) afford to DHL and its officers,
employees, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives prompt,
reasonable access during normal business hours to all of Airbornes and its
Subsidiaries properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records, (ii) furnish as promptly as practicable to DHL such information
concerning the Separation of the Airco Business from the businesses,
properties, operations and personnel of Airborne and its Subsidiaries as DHL
may from time to time reasonably request and (iii) keep DHL fully informed, on
a current basis, of its progress in preparing for the Separation and to
regularly consult with DHL with respect to the appropriate strategy for
effecting the Separation. Any such review by DHL shall not affect the
representations or warranties of Airborne contained in this Agreement. DHL
will hold any information provided under this _Section 5.13_ in confidence to
the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.



(c) Each of the Parties hereby agrees to amend this Agreement to substitute
a revised Separation Agreement to (i) amend the Separation Agreement in any
reasonable manner requested by DHL in order to obtain the most tax-efficient
structure for the formation and distribution of Airco; _provided_ that such
amendment will (A) not result in a material increase in Aircos Taxes for a
taxable period or portion thereof beginning on or after the Closing Date, (B)
not increase the amounts that would otherwise be outstanding under the
Promissory Notes, (C) not result in an adverse effect on the tax treatment of
the Separation or the Merger for Airbornes stockholders or (D) materially
adversely affect Airco or the stockholders of Airborne and (ii) amend the
Schedules to the Separation Agreement (x) in any manner reasonably requested
by either party in order to ensure that Airco will, after the Effective Time,
be able to perform the Airco Business and its obligations under the ACMI
Agreement or conduct any other business contemplated by the business plan for
Airco provided to DHL prior to the date hereof or (y) as the Parties may
otherwise agree. Airborne here by agrees to, and will cause all of its
Subsidiaries to, (1) subject to _Section 5.6(a)_ , not enter into any
additional agreement with respect to the Separation of the Airco Business
from the businesses, properties, operations and personnel of Airborne and its
Subsidiaries and (2) not enter into any agreement that is inconsistent with
the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Separation Agreement. No
amendment to the Separation Agreement described in _Section 5.13(c)(i)_ that
causes any of the representations set forth in _Section 3.13_ to be untrue or
incomplete shall result in a failure to satisfy the closing condition
set forth in _Section 7.3_ hereunder.



Section 5.14 _Amendments to the Transaction Agreements_. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Parties agrees that it will, and Airborne will
cause Airco and any of its other Subsidiaries to, not amend, waive or modify,

Agreements, including executing and delivering any amendments to
the Transaction Agreements that may reasonably be required to effect the
transactions contemplated thereby; _provided_ that, subject to _Section 5.12_
, no Party shall be obligated to agree to any such amendment that would (i)
adversely effect any rights or obligations of such Party or the Surviving
Corporation under the Transaction Agreements in a manner which, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to
the assets, liabilities, business, results of operations, or condition
(financial or otherwise) of such Party or the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) materially impair the ability of such
Party or the Surviving Corporation to conduct its business as currently
conducted or as contemplated to be conducted by the Transaction Agreements.

contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Parties
shall mutually agree upon their respective initial press releases regarding
the execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) nothing in this _Section 5.17_ shall be deemed to prohibit any party
hereto from making any disclosure which is consistent in all material respects
with (A) the press releases issued by either Party pursuant to clause (i) or
(B) the communication guidelines separately agreed between the Parties prior
to the date hereof, as the same may be amended by the Parties from time to
time (the _"Communication Guidelines_ _"_ ), (iii) nothing in this  _Section
5.17_ shall be deemed to prohibit any party hereto from making any disclosure
which its counsel deems necessary in order to fulfill such Partys disclosure
obligations imposed by law, legal process or the rules of any
national securities exchange or automated quotation system, so long as the
disclosing Party consults with the other Parties prior to such disclosure and
considers in good faith the other Parties considerations with respect to such
disclosure and (iv) any Party may issue a press release or make any other
public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls as long as any such releases or statements are not

to the Communication Guidelines or any previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by DHL or Airborne in compliance with
the terms of this Agreement, including this _Section 5.17_. Each of the
Parties aggress that it shall not, without the prior written consent of the
other Parties, make any statements to employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any Party may issue statements or make statements to employees that are not

from time to time. The Parties shall set forth procedures for coordinating the
making of public releases, communications to employees or other public
statements, including designating a contact person at a senior level for each
Party who will be responsible for administering the consent process.





 

47 Section 5.18 _Cooperation of Third Parties_. Where the cooperation of
third parties such as insurers or trustees would be necessary in order for a
Party hereto to completely fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and
the Transaction Agreements, each Party will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to seek the cooperation of such third parties.



Section 5.19 __ _WARN_ __. Neither Airborne nor Airco shall, at any

(b) by either Airborne or DHL upon written notice to the other Party:



(i) if the Merger has not been consummated on or before November 25, 2003
(such date, as it may be extended as set forth below, the _"End Date_ _"_ );
_provided_ that the Parties may mutually agree to extend the End Date for a
period of up to 60 days from November 25, 2003, in order that the Parties may
seek to have any Legal Prohibition that is in effect on such date removed;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a Party whose breach of
any provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be
consummated by the End Date;



(ii) after the date of this Agreement, if any Governmental Authority
(including any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction) shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule,
regulation, executive order, decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), in any case that is in effect
and that prevents or prohibits consummation of the Merger or any of the other
material transactions contemplated in this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements (a _"Legal Prohibition"_ ); _provided_  that the Party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall have used
its best efforts to prevent such Legal Prohibition and to cause any such Legal
Prohibition to be vacated or otherwise rendered of no effect; or



 

52 (iii) if the Airborne Stockholders Approval shall not have been obtained
following a vote at the Airborne Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof);



(c) by DHL upon written notice to Airborne:



(i) if the board of directors of Airborne or any committee thereof shall

Stockholders Meeting in accordance with _Section 5.4(a)_ ; 



(ii) if Airborne shall have breached in any material respect any of its
obligations under _Section 5.4_ or _Section 5.5_ ; or



(iii) if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
the part of Airborne set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that
would cause the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ not to
be satisfied; _provided_ that such breach cannot be or is not cured within
sixty (60) days of notice of such breach from DHL (or, if sooner, the day
prior to the End Date); or



(d) by Airborne upon written notice to DHL:



(i) in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of _Section
5.5(c)_ ;  _provided_ that such termination under this clause (d)(i) shall
not be effective until Airborne has made payment of the fee required
simultaneously with such termination pursuant to _Section 9.3(d)_ ; or



(ii) if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
the part of DHL or Acquisition set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred
that would cause the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_
not to be satisfied;  _provided_ that such breach cannot be or is not cured
within sixty (60) days of notice of such breach from Airborne (or, if sooner,
the day prior to the End Date).

pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any Party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such Party) to the other
Parties hereto, except that (i) the agreements contained in this _Sections
9.2_ and _9.3_ of this Agreement and in the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the termination hereof, and (ii) no such termination shall relieve
any Party of any liability or damages resulting from any willful breach by
such Party of this Agreement.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.3_ , all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the

(c) If (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ ,
(B) prior to the Airborne Stockholders Meeting, an Acquisition Proposal is
made by any Third Party and (C) within twelve (12) months of the Airborne
Stockholders Meeting, either (1) Airborne or any of its Subsidiaries enters
into an agreement with any Person (other than DHL or an Affiliate of DHL)
with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal or (2) if neither
Airborne nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into an agreement
contemplated in clause (C)(1), any Third Party commences a tender offer that,
if consummated, would result in the acquisition by the Third Party making the
tender offer of fifty percent (50%) or more of the Airborne Common Stock, then
Airborne shall pay to DHL the Termination Fee at the times provided therefor
in  _Section 9.3(e)_.



(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Airborne pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(i)_ , then Airborne shall pay to DHL the Termination Fee at the times
provided therefor in _Section 9.3(e)_.





 

53 (e) If the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_ ,
then Airborne shall pay the Termination Fee within one (1) Business Day after
the termination of this Agreement. If the Termination Fee becomes payable
pursuant to Section 9.3(d), then Airborne shall pay the Termination Fee
concurrent with the termination of this Agreement. If the Termination Fee
becomes payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_ , then Airborne shall pay the
Termination Fee (i) within one (1) Business Day after Airborne or any of its
subsidiaries entering into an agreement contemplated by Section 9.3(c)(C)(1)

Stockholders Meeting, (ii) within one (1) Business Day after the consummation
of the transaction contemplated by any other agreement contemplated by

available funds. If Airborne fails to pay to the Termination Fee at the time
provided above, it shall pay the costs and expenses of DHL (including legal

any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with
interest on the amount of any unpaid fee at the publicly announced prime rate
of Citibank, N.A. in New York City from the date such fee was required to be
paid to the date it is paid; _provided_ , _however_ , that Airborne shall not
pay such costs and expenses of DHL and DHL shall instead pay to Airborne the
costs and expenses of Airborne (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such action if DHLs claim against Airborne in such legal
action does not prevail.

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any provision or any part of any
provision of this Agreement shall be void or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever, then such provision shall be stricken and of no force and effect.

the consideration bargained for by a Party, the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and, to the extent required,
shall be modified to preserve their validity. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision or any part of any provision is void or

reason of this Agreement on any Persons other than the Parties and their

in whole or in part after the Effective Time.



Section 10.12 _Counterparts_. To facilitate execution, this Agreement
may be executed in any number of counterparts (including by facsimile
transmission), each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one binding agreement on the
Parties, notwithstanding that not all Parties are signatories to the same
counterpart.



Section 10.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and
that the Parties are entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in
addition to any other remedies at law or in equity.
