_Section 1.05(a)_; such fact does not imply that (x) such Asset must be
Conveyed more than once or (y) that any duplication of such Asset is required.
The fact that an Asset may be excluded under one clause does not imply that
it is not intended to be included under another and the exclusions herein will
not affect the covenants in _Sections 4.18, 4.25 and 4.26_.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 1.05(a)_ or any other provision hereof, the
Wimbledon Assets will not in any event include any of the following Assets
(the " _Excluded Assets_ "):

1.05(a)_ and the corresponding section of the Seller Disclosure Letter;

(x) all financial and Tax records relating to the Snacks Business that form
part of the general ledger of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the

provide to Acquiror copies of any portions of such financial and Tax records
that relate solely to the Wimbledon Entities, the other Wimbledon Assets or
the Snacks Business; 

(xi) subject to _Section 4.15_, all rights to insurance policies or practices
of Seller and its Affiliates (including any captive insurance policies,

payable in connection with the cancellation or discontinuance of any such
policies or practices and any claims made under such policies;

otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries will acquire or be permitted to
retain any right, title or interest in any Excluded Assets through the
Conveyance of the Wimbledon Entity Interests, and that if any of the Wimbledon
Entities owns, leases or has the right to use any such Excluded Assets, such
Excluded Assets will be Conveyed to Seller as contemplated by _Section
1.03_. 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, any Assets of any member of
the Seller Group not included in any of the clauses in _Section 1.05(a)_
above are Excluded Assets and no Excluded Assets will be Wimbledon Assets. For
the avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 4.25_ and the Ancillary
Agreements, all right, title and interest in and to the Excluded IP Assets
are expressly retained by the Seller Group in all respects.

1.06 __Wimbledon Liabilities__. (a) For the purposes of this Agreement, "
_Wimbledon Liabilities_ " will mean each of the following Liabilities,
regardless of (x) when such Liabilities arise, where or against whom such
Liabilities are asserted or determined and (y) whether arising from or
alleged to arise from negligence, recklessness, violation of Law, fraud or
misrepresentation by Seller or any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents, Subsidiaries or Affiliates;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event will Wimbledon Liabilities include any Liability to the extent arising
out of, relating to or otherwise in respect of facts, circumstances, actions
or inactions that occurred or failed to occur prior to the Closing or the
ownership or use of the Wimbledon Assets or the operation or conduct of the
Snacks Business prior to the Closing except for the Liabilities included in
(i), (v) or (vi) below and as further described in  _Section 1.06(c)_
(collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Liabilities_ "):

(i) any and all Liabilities to the extent reflected in the Final Closing
Adjustment Statement;

(ii) any and all Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates to the extent
arising out of, relating to or otherwise in respect of, the ownership or use
of the Wimbledon Assets or the operation or the conduct of the Snacks Business
at or after the Closing;;

 

(iii) all Liabilities to the extent relating to or arising out of any
Environmental Conditions existing at or after the Closing or arising out of
operations at any of the Wimbledon Facilities following the Closing (which,
for purposes of this _Section 1.06(a)(iii)_, will be deemed to include the
Mechelen Facility), or otherwise existing on, under, about or in the vicinity
of any of the Wimbledon Facilities (including any release of Hazardous
Materials occurring at or after the Closing that migrates to any of the
Wimbledon Facilities and Environmental Conditions at any third-party site to
the extent Liability arises from Hazardous Materials generated at any
Wimbledon

 



7  Facility) or any violation of or remediation or other requirements under,
any Environmental Law as a result of the operation of any of the Wimbledon
Facilities at or following the Closing, except, in the case of the Mechelen
Facility, any such Liabilities: (A) that arise exclusively from the operation
of Sellers fabric care business will be an Excluded Liability, (B) that arise
exclusively from the operation of the Snacks Business will be a Wimbledon
Liability, and (C) that are determined to arise from both the operation of
Sellers fabric care business and the Snacks Business will be allocated based
on the contribution of each such business to such Liability;

(iv) all Liabilities for Taxes relating to the Wimbledon Assets or the Snacks
Business with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, other than Excluded
Taxes;

(v) the Liabilities listed on _Section 1.06(a)(v)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and all other Liabilities that are expressly provided by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement as Liabilities to be assumed by Acquiror or any
other member of the Acquiror Group and all Liabilities of Acquiror or
any other member of the Acquiror Group under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, including (A) Liabilities in respect of Continuing Employees under
the Snacks Business Pension Plans as contemplated by _Section 1.05(a)(xv)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, but excluding all other Liabilities under the
Snacks Business Pension Plans (including Liabilities in respect of persons
other than Continuing Employees), (B) Liabilities in connection with the
collection of amounts due under loans outstanding to Continuing Employees as
of the Closing Date (other than loans under a tax-qualified Compensation And
Benefit Plan), and (C) all Liabilities allocated to or expressly assumed by
any member of the Acquiror Group pursuant to _Article V_ (including any
schedule thereto); and

(vi) any and all Liabilities for trade and consumer promotions arising after
the Closing, including in-store promotions and coupons with respect to the
Snacks Business committed to by Seller or any of its Affiliates prior to the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, Liabilities relating to off-
invoice allowances are to be deemed to have arisen at the time of sale and
will be deemed Pre-Closing Liabilities if relating to pre-Closing sales.

A single Liability may fall within more than one of clauses (i)-(iv) in this
_Section 1.06(a)_; such fact does not imply that (x) such Liability must be
Conveyed more than once or (y) any duplication of such Liability is required.
The fact that a Liability may be excluded under one clause does not imply that
it is not intended to be included under another.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Wimbledon Liabilities will not in any
event include any of the following Liabilities (the " _Excluded Liabilities_
"):

 

(i)(A) all Pre-Closing Liabilities and (B) all Liabilities to the extent
relating to, arising out of, resulting from or otherwise in respect of the

of any

 



8  equity interest in, or business, operations, assets or properties of, any
Person by Seller, its Affiliates or any Wimbledon Entities or the disposition
of any product line or real property prior to the Closing, (B) for product
liability or similar claims to the extent arising out of or relating to any
product sold by Seller, its Affiliates or any Wimbledon Entities prior to the
Closing, (C) for any Indebtedness of any Wimbledon Entity (excluding
Indebtedness owed by a Wimbledon Entity to another Wimbledon Entity) as of the
Closing, or (D) arising out of or relating to the steps taken, including the
transfers of any Assets and Liabilities or any other action taken
or transaction entered into outside of the ordinary course of business in
anticipation of the transactions contemplated hereunder, prior to the Closing;

(iii) (A) all Liabilities (including reporting and withholding and other
related Taxes) under Compensation And Benefit Plans and all other compensation
and benefits plans sponsored by the Seller Group, other than (in the case of
this clause (A)) Liabilities in respect of (1) Continuing Employees under the
Snacks Business Pension Plans as contemplated by _Section 1.05(a)(xv)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, (2) Liabilities in connection with the collection
of amounts due under loans outstanding to Continuing Employees as of the
Closing Date (other than loans under a Tax-qualified Compensation And Benefit
Plan) and (3) all Liabilities allocated to or for which Acquiror is expressly
liable pursuant to _Article V_ (including any schedule thereto) and (B) any
other Liabilities allocated to, or expressly retained by, Seller or any of its
Affiliates pursuant to _Article V_ (including any schedule thereto).

(iv) all Liabilities for Excluded Taxes;

 

(v) all Liabilities under Intercompany Accounts; and

(vi) all Liabilities that are expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement as Liabilities to be retained or assumed by Seller or any
other member of the Seller Group, and all Liabilities of any member of the
Seller Group under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that neither Acquiror nor any other member
of the Acquiror Group will be required to assume or retain any Excluded
Liabilities as a result of the Conveyance of the Wimbledon Entity Interests,
and that if any of the Wimbledon Entities is liable for any
Excluded Liabilities, such Excluded Liabilities will be assumed by Seller as
contemplated by _Section 1.03_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing herein will be construed as eliminating, reducing
or otherwise altering any of Acquirors or its Affiliates respective
obligations under _Article V_ (including any schedule thereto).

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, to the extent the facts,
circumstances, actions, inactions, ownership or use of the Wimbledon Assets,
or operation or conduct of the Snacks Business, giving rise to a Liability
that would otherwise be a Pre-Closing Liability continue following the Closing
such that there is additional liability resulting from such facts,
circumstances, actions, inactions, continued ownership or continued use of
the Wimbledon Assets, or the continued operation or conduct of the Snacks
Business, after the Closing, such Liability will constitute a

 



9  Pre-Closing Liability to the extent the Liability relates to the period
prior to the Closing and will constitute a Wimbledon Liability to the extent
of such additional Liability from and after the Closing Date and will be
allocated between Seller and Acquiror on that basis.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, any Liabilities of any member
of the Seller Group not included in any of the clauses in _Section 1.06(a)_
above are Excluded Liabilities, and no Excluded Liabilities will be Wimbledon
Liabilities.

 

1.07 __Termination Of Intercompany Agreements; Settlement Of Intercompany
Accounts__. (a) Except as set forth in _Section 1.07(b)_, the Wimbledon
Entities, on the one hand, and Seller, on behalf of itself and each other
member of the Seller Group, on the other hand, hereby terminate any and all
Contracts, including any Contracts entered into prior to, on or after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, whether or not in writing,
between or among any of the Wimbledon Entities, on the one hand, and Seller or
any member of the Seller Group, on the other hand, effective without further
action as of the Closing. No such Contract (including any provision thereof
which purports to survive termination) will be of any further force or effect
after the Closing and all parties will be released from all Liabilities and
obligations thereunder. Each Party will, at the reasonable request of any
other Party, take, or cause to be taken, such other actions as may be
necessary to effect the foregoing.

 

(b) The provisions of _Section 1.07(a)_ will not apply to any of the
following Contracts (or to any of the provisions thereof): 

(i) this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (and each other Contract
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to be
entered into or continued by any of the Parties or any of the members of their
respective Groups);

 

(ii) the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 1.07(b)(ii)_ to which any Person
other than the Parties and their respective Affiliates is a party (it being
understood that to the extent that the rights and Liabilities of the Parties
and the members of their respective Groups under any such Contracts constitute
Wimbledon Assets or Wimbledon Liabilities, they will be Conveyed pursuant to
_Section 1.01_ or _1.02_ or treated as provided in _Section 1.07(c)_); and

(iii) the Contracts set forth on Schedule 1.07(b)(iii).

(c) All of the intercompany receivables, payables, loans and other
accounts, rights and Liabilities between any Wimbledon Entity, on the one
hand, and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Wimbledon
Entities), on the other hand, in existence as of immediately prior to the
Closing (collectively, the " _Intercompany Accounts_ ") will be netted
against each other, and the balance will be, without further action, deemed to
have been contributed to the equity of such Wimbledon Entity or distributed to
Seller, as the case may be, such that, as of the Closing, there are no
Intercompany Accounts outstanding.

 



10 (d) Except for the intercompany receivables, payables, loans and other
accounts set forth on Schedule 1.07(d), all intercompany obligations between
and among the Wimbledon Entities in existence as of immediately prior to the
Closing will be extinguished, such that, as of the Closing, there are no such
amounts outstanding.

 

1.08 __Governmental Approvals And Third-Party Consents__. (a) _Obtaining
Consents_. To the extent that the consummation of any of the transactions or
Conveyances contemplated hereby requires any Consents or Governmental
Approvals, the Parties will, prior to the Closing and for a period not to
exceed one year thereafter, use their respective best efforts to obtain such
Consents or Governmental Approvals, subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section 1.08_; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party will be
required to make any payments, incur any Liability or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any such
Consent, other than the incurrence of incidental expenses relating to
obtaining any such Consent, except and only to the extent that Acquiror agrees
to reimburse and make whole Seller to Sellers reasonable satisfaction for
any payment or other accommodation made by Seller at Acquirors request. For
the avoidance of doubt, the required efforts and responsibilities of the
Parties (i) to seek the Consents necessary to provide the Services (as
defined in the TSA) will be governed by _Section 7.4_ of the TSA and (ii) to
seek Governmental Approvals pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust
Laws will be governed by  _Section 4.02_.

(b) _Transfer In Violation Of Laws Or Requiring Consent Or Governmental
Approval_. If and to the extent that the valid, complete and perfected
Conveyance to Acquiror of any Wimbledon Asset or to the Seller Group of any
Excluded Asset would be a violation of applicable Laws or require any Consent
or Governmental Approval in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby that has not been obtained at the Closing, then, notwithstanding any
other provision hereof, the Conveyance to Acquiror of such Wimbledon Asset or
to the Seller Group of such Excluded Asset will automatically be deferred and
no Conveyance will occur until all legal impediments are removed or such
Consents or Governmental Approvals have been obtained (except that Seller or
Acquiror may elect to require the immediate Conveyance of any Wimbledon Asset
or Excluded Asset notwithstanding any requirement that an immaterial Consent
or immaterial Governmental Approval be obtained, but only if no criminal
Liabilities or other material consequences for which indemnification would be
insufficient would or would reasonably be expected to arise from such
Conveyance; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if Acquiror so elects to require
the immediate Conveyance of any such Wimbledon Asset or Excluded Asset, any
Liabilities arising from such Conveyance will be deemed to be Wimbledon
Liabilities, (ii) if Seller so elects to require the immediate Conveyance of
any such Wimbledon Asset or Excluded Asset, any Liabilities arising from such
Conveyance will be deemed to be Excluded Liabilities, and (iii) if Acquiror
and Seller jointly agree to immediately Convey such Wimbledon Asset or
Excluded Asset, any Liabilities arising from such Conveyance will be shared
evenly between Acquiror and Seller and, notwithstanding any provision in
_Section 8.04_ to the contrary, the defense of any Third-Party Claim relating
thereto will be jointly managed by Acquiror and Seller). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such Asset will still be considered a Wimbledon Asset
or Excluded Asset, as applicable, and

 



11  the Person retaining such Asset will thereafter hold such Asset in trust for
the benefit, insofar as reasonably possible, of the Person entitled thereto
(and at such Persons sole expense) until the consummation of the Conveyance
thereof. The Parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to develop and implement arrangements to place the Person entitled to receive
such Asset, insofar as reasonably possible, in the same position as if such
Asset had been Conveyed as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits
and burdens relating to such Asset, including possession, use, risk of loss,
potential for gain, any Tax Liabilities in respect thereof and dominion,
control and command over such Asset, are to inure from and after the Closing
to such Person. If and when the legal or contractual impediments the presence
of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Asset pursuant to this 
_Section 1.08(b)_ are removed or any Consents and/or Governmental Approvals
the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Asset pursuant to
this _Section 1.08(b)_ are obtained, the transfer of the applicable
Asset will be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or
such applicable Ancillary Agreement. The obligations set forth in this
_Section 1.08(b)_ will terminate on the two-year anniversary of the Closing.

 

1.09 __Waiver Of Bulk-Sales Laws__. Each of Seller and Acquiror hereby waives
compliance by each member of their respective Group with the requirements and
provisions of the "bulk-sale" or "bulk-transfer" Laws of any jurisdiction that
may otherwise be applicable with respect to the transfer or sale of any or all
of the Assets to any member of the Seller Group or Acquiror Group, as
applicable.

1.10 __Closing_._ __ On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the consummation of the purchase and Conveyance of the
Wimbledon Assets and the assumption of the Wimbledon Liabilities (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place at Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York,
New York, at 10:00 a.m., local time on the last Business Day of the calendar
month in which the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ occurs (other than those conditions that by their nature or
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are to be satisfied at or immediately
prior to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, the
waiver of those conditions). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred
to as the " _Closing Date_."

1.11 __Purchase Price__. (a) The aggregate purchase price to be paid to Seller
in full consideration of the Wimbledon Assets will consist of (i)
$2,695,000,000 in cash, minus (ii) the amount (if any) by which the Closing
Specified Net Assets is less than the Target Specified Net Assets or plus
(iii) the amount (if any) by which the Closing Specified Net Assets is
greater than the Target Specified Net Assets (the " _Purchase Price_ "), and
the assumption by Acquiror or one or more of its Affiliates of the Wimbledon
Liabilities.

 

(b) Not later than five Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller will
provide to Acquiror its good faith estimate (using the Sellers most
currently available financial information and calculated in accordance with
the Sample Specified Net Assets) of the Purchase Price and reasonable
supporting detail thereof (the " _Proposed Estimated Purchase Price_ ").
Acquiror will review the Proposed Estimated Purchase Price and calculation
thereof, and if Acquiror disagrees with such statement or any of

 



12  the matters therein, it will provide written notice to the Seller and Seller
and Acquiror will attempt to resolve in good faith any such disagreements
prior to the Closing. The Estimated Purchase Price as so agreed will be the
Estimated Purchase Price for purposes of the Closing (the " _Closing Estimated
Purchase Price_ "). If Seller and Acquiror are unable to agree on the Closing
Estimated Purchase Price for purposes of the Closing, the Proposed Estimated
Purchase Price will be the Closing Estimated Purchase Price for purposes of
the Closing, without prejudice to _Section 1.12_.

(c) At the Closing and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, in consideration of the Conveyance of the Wimbledon Assets,
Acquiror and/or its designated Affiliates will assume the Wimbledon
Liabilities and pay to Seller and/or its designated Affiliates in cash the
Closing Estimated Purchase Price as determined in accordance with _Section
1.11(b)_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Seller in writing not less than two days prior to the Closing
Date.

1.12 __Balance Sheet Adjustment__. (a) Within 60 days following the Closing
Date, Seller will prepare and deliver to Acquiror a statement setting forth
Sellers calculation of the Closing Specified Net Assets and the amount of
each line item included in the calculation of the Closing Specified Net
Assets and the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price (the " _Closing
Adjustment Statement_ "). Upon the request of Seller, Acquiror will provide to
Seller and its accountants access during normal business hours to the books
and records, any other information and to any employees of Acquiror or any
other member of the Acquiror Group necessary for Seller to prepare the Closing
Adjustment Statement, to respond to any Acquiror Objection and to prepare
materials for presentation to the Accounting Firm contemplated by this
_Section 1.12_, and Acquiror will otherwise cooperate with and assist Seller
as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this  _Section
1.12_.

(b) For a period of 60 days after delivery of the Closing Adjustment
Statement, Seller will make available to Acquiror all books, records, work
papers, personnel (including their accountants and employees) and other
materials and sources used by Seller to prepare the Closing Adjustment
Statement and not already in the possession or under the control of Acquiror.
The Closing Adjustment Statement will be binding and conclusive upon, and
deemed accepted by, Acquiror unless Acquiror notifies Seller in writing within
60 days after delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement of any good faith
objection thereto (the " _Acquiror Objection_ "). Any Acquiror Objection will
set forth a description in reasonable detail of the basis of the Acquiror
Objection and the adjustments to the value of Specified Net Assets
reflected on the Closing Adjustment Statement prepared by Seller which
Acquiror believes should be made. Any items not disputed during the foregoing
60-day period will be deemed to have been accepted by Acquiror.

 

(c) If Seller and Acquiror are unable to resolve any of their disputes with
respect to the Closing Adjustment Statement within 30 days following Sellers
receipt of the Acquiror Objection pursuant to _Section 1.12(b)_, they will
refer their remaining differences to a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants 

 



13  as to which Seller and Acquiror mutually agree (the " _Accounting Firm_ ")
for a decision to be rendered within 90 days of such referral, which decision
will be final and binding on the Parties. The Accounting Firm will act as an
arbitrator and not an expert and will address only those items that are in
dispute and for each item may not assign a value greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Party or smaller than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either Party. Any expenses relating to the
engagement of the Accounting Firm will be shared equally by Seller and
Acquiror.

 

(d) The Closing Adjustment Statement and the resulting recalculated Purchase
Price (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") will become final and binding on the
Parties upon the earliest of (i) if no Acquiror Objection has been given, the
expiration of the period within which Acquiror must make its objection
pursuant to _Section 1.12(b)_, (ii) agreement in writing by Seller and
Acquiror that the Closing Adjustment Statement, together with any
modifications thereto agreed by Seller and Acquiror, will be final and
binding, and (iii) the date on which the Accounting Firm issues its
written determination with respect to any dispute relating to such Closing
Adjustment Statement. The Closing Adjustment Statement, as submitted by Seller
if no timely Acquiror Objection has been given, as adjusted pursuant to any
agreement between the Parties or as determined pursuant to the decision of
the Accounting Firm, when final and binding on all Parties and upon which a
judgment may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, is herein
referred to as the " _Final Closing Adjustment Statement_."

(e) Within five Business Days following the determination of the Final Closing
Adjustment Statement, the net adjustment payment payable pursuant to this
_Section 1.12(e)_ (the " _Adjustment Payment_ ") and interest thereon will be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
designated by Seller or Acquiror, as the case may be. The Adjustment Payment
will be equal to (i) the Final Purchase Price, as reflected on the Final
Closing Adjustment Statement _minus_ (ii) the Closing Estimated Purchase
Price. The Adjustment Payment, if any, will be payable by Acquiror to Seller,
if positive, and if the Adjustment Payment is negative, an amount equal to the
absolute value of such Adjustment Payment will be payable by Seller to
Acquiror. The Adjustment Payment will bear interest from the Closing Date to
the date of payment at the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street
Journal, Northeastern Edition) in effect on the Closing Date, which interest
will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of
days elapsed and such interest will be paid on the same date and in the same
manner as such Adjustment Payment.

(f) Following issuance of the Final Closing Adjustment Statement, neither
Party will have any further right to make any claims against the other Party
in respect of any item of Closing Adjustment Statement to the extent it was
included in the Final Closing Adjustment Statement and would therefore result
in a duplicative payment or benefit to Acquiror or Seller, as the case may be,
of amounts recovered as an Adjustment Payment pursuant to _Section 1.12(e)_.

 

1.13 __Closing Deliveries__. (a) _Agreements To Be Delivered By Seller_. On
the Closing Date, Seller will deliver, or will cause its appropriate
Subsidiaries to deliver, to Acquiror all of the following instruments:

 



14 (i) A Transition Services Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto
as  _Exhibit A_ (the " _TSA_ "), duly executed by Seller and the other
members of the Seller Group party thereto;

(ii) All necessary Transfer Documents as described in _Sections 1.14_ and
_1.15_ ;

(iii) Resignations of each of the individuals who serve as an officer or
director of the Wimbledon Entities in their capacity as such and the
resignations of any other Persons that will be employees of any member of the
Seller Group after the Closing and that are directors or officers of any
Wimbledon Entity, to the extent requested by Acquiror;

(iv) A Facilities Agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ (the " _Facilities Agreement_ "), duly executed by Seller and the
other members of Seller Group party thereto;

(v) If applicable, the agreement with respect to the Split Plan contemplated
by _Section 4.27_, duly executed by Seller and the other members of the
Seller Group party thereto; and

(vi) A duly executed certificate of non-foreign status, substantially in the
form of the sample certification set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B), from Seller and each other member of the Seller Group
that (A) transfers Wimbledon Assets pursuant to this Agreement and (B) is a
United States person for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

(b) _Agreements to be Delivered by Acquiror_. On the Closing Date, Acquiror
will deliver, or will cause its Subsidiaries to deliver, as appropriate, to
Seller each Ancillary Agreement, Transfer Document and countersigned documents
contemplated to be executed and delivered by Seller pursuant to _Section
1.13(a)_, each duly executed by Acquiror or such Affiliate party thereto.

1.14  _ _Transfer Of Wimbledon Assets And Assumption Of Wimbledon
Liabilities__. In furtherance of the Conveyance of Wimbledon Assets and

II. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Seller hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror that, except as set forth
in writing on the corresponding section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and each other section or subsection to the extent the relevance of any
such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face:

2.01 __Due Organization, Good Standing And Corporate Power__. (a) Seller is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Seller and its Subsidiaries have
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate their
properties that will be Conveyed to Acquiror, to carry on the Snacks Business
as now being conducted and to enter into and carry out its obligations under
this Agreement and/or the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or will be at
Closing, a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Seller and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
property 

 



16  owned, leased or operated by the Snacks Business that will be Conveyed to
Acquiror or the nature of the Snacks Business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Snacks Business MAE.

 

2.02 __Authorization Of Agreement__. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Seller and, if applicable,
its Subsidiaries, and the consummation by it and, as of the Closing, its
Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been or
will be duly authorized and approved by its board of directors and no other
corporate or shareholder action on the part of Seller or its Subsidiaries is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, when executed, will be duly executed and delivered by
Seller, and its Subsidiaries (to the extent it is a party thereto), and each
is (or when executed will be) a valid and binding obligation of Seller and
enforceable against Seller, in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
that its enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Law affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles (such
exception, the " _Enforceability Exception_ ").

2.03 __Consents And Approvals; No Violations__. Assuming (a) the filings
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), are made and the waiting periods thereunder (if
applicable) have been terminated or expired, (b) the Consents from
Governmental Authorities set forth on _Section 2.03(b)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter have been obtained, and (c) the filings with and consents
from Governmental Authorities required to Convey the Real Property and other

or conflict with any provision of their respective certificates or articles
of incorporation, bylaws or code of regulations (or the comparable governing
documents); (ii) violate or conflict with any Law or Order of any Governmental
Authority applicable to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of
their respective properties or assets that will be Conveyed to Acquiror or are

any Governmental Approval; or (iv) result in a violation or breach of,

are owned by the Wimbledon Entities as of the Closing, or give rise to any
obligation, right of termination, cancellation, suspension, revocation,
acceleration, penalty or increase of any obligation or a loss of a material
benefit under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Wimbledon
Material Contract, excluding in the

 



17  case of clauses (ii) through (iv) above, conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, rights of payment and reimbursement, terminations, modifications,
accelerations and creations and impositions of Security Interests which would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Snacks
Business MAE.

2.04 __Intellectual Property__. (a) Subject to the next sentence, Seller or a
Wimbledon Entity is the sole and exclusive owner of the Registered
Intellectual Property being Conveyed pursuant to _Section 1.05_ or licensed
pursuant to _Section 4.25_ free and clear of any Security Interests except
for such Security Interests that are not material to the Snacks Business and
such owner is entitled to use all Included IP Registered Intellectual
Property in the operation of the Snacks Business as operated by Seller prior
to Closing. Except as set forth in _Section 1.05(a)(vii)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter or a Contract listed in  _Section 2.07_, no Included IP
Asset that constitutes Intellectual Property that is registered or the subject
of a pending application for registration in any jurisdiction (the "
_Registered Intellectual Property_ ") is owned by more than one Person, is
licensed to any third party or is subject to any material restrictions on its
disclosure, use, license or transfer. The Contract under which any material
item of Licensed Intellectual Property within the Included IP Assets is
licensed (the " _Licensed Intellectual Property_ ") is in full force and
effect, is valid and enforceable. Seller or a Wimbledon Entity has the right
to use each material item of Licensed Intellectual Property in
accordance with the terms of the applicable license Contract in the operation
of the Snacks Business as conducted by Seller prior to Closing.

conducted by Seller and its Subsidiaries does not infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate any Registered Intellectual Property right of any third
party. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Snacks Business MAE, with respect to
Intellectual Property other than Registered Intellectual Property, the
Snacks Business as currently conducted by Seller and its Subsidiaries does
not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property
right of any third party. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Snacks Business MAE,
during the past two years, no third party has made any written claim or demand
or instituted any Action against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the
Knowledge of Seller threatened the same, and neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice, that (i) challenges the rights
of Seller and its Subsidiaries in respect of any of the Intellectual Property
utilized in the Snacks Business or (ii) asserts that the operation of the
Snacks Business is or was infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating
the Intellectual Property rights of any third party. None of the Intellectual
Property utilized in the Snacks Business is subject to any material
outstanding order, ruling, decree, judgment or stipulation by or with any
Governmental Authority applicable to the Snacks Business. To Sellers
Knowledge, no Person is engaging in any activity that materially
infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates any of the Included IP
Assets.

(c) Without prejudice to _Section 4.25_, the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 2.04(a)_ constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties with respect to ownership or registration of
Intellectual Property and the 

 



18  representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.04(b)_ constitute
the sole and exclusive representations and warranties with respect to the
Snacks Business infringement, misappropriation or other violation of
Intellectual Property rights of third parties.

2.05 __Litigation__. There are no Actions pending against Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective properties, rights or
franchises), at Law or in equity, or before or by any Governmental Authority
or any arbitrator or arbitration tribunal, that have had or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Snacks Business MAE.
Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Order applicable
to any Wimbledon Entity or the Snacks Business, other than any Order generally
applicable to the businesses in which the Snacks Business operates, that would
reasonably be expected to affect, in any material respect, individually or in
the aggregate, the Snacks Business.

2.06 __Compliance With Laws__. (a) Except as has not had and would not be
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Snacks
Business MAE, the Snacks Business is being conducted in compliance with
applicable Laws. None of the Permits required for the continued conduct of the
Snacks Business as such business is currently being conducted will lapse,
terminate, expire or otherwise be impaired as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements, except as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Snacks Business MAE.

(b) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Snacks Business MAE, since July 1, 2010,
there has been no recall or withdrawal by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries of
any product of the Snacks Business.

to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(c) have been made (or will be made)

Manufacturing Company.

(e)(i) Each Wimbledon Entity has complied in all material respects with
any relevant VAT Laws; (ii) none of the Wimbledon Entities is a member of a
group of companies for the purposes of any relevant VAT Laws (other than a
group consisting solely of Wimbledon Entities); and (iii) none of the
Wimbledon Entities has made any exempt supplies in consequence of which such
Wimbledon Entity is or will be unable to obtain a credit for all input VAT
paid by such Wimbledon Entity.

 



25 (f) Within the past three years, no Taxing Authority in any jurisdiction in
which a Wimbledon Entity does not file any income or franchise Tax Returns
has made a claim in writing that such Wimbledon Entity is or may be subject to
a material amount of taxation by that jurisdiction.

 

2.11 __Broker s Or Finders Fee__. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker,
finder or other agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for which Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including the Wimbledon
Entities) could become liable or obligated. 

2.12 __Title To Properties; Security Interests__. Seller and its Subsidiaries
have good and valid title to, or, if applicable, valid leasehold interests in
or valid right to use, all Wimbledon Assets, in each case as such property is
currently being used, subject to no Security Interests, except for Permitted
Encumbrances.

 

2.13 __The Wimbledon Assets__. (a) The Wimbledon Assets include the fixtures,
machinery, equipment, furniture, office equipment, motor vehicles and other
transportation equipment, special and general tangible tools, prototypes and
models, other tangible personal property and other Assets (other than, the
Background IP, Assets for which provision for access thereto is made in the
TSA or as otherwise set forth in _Section 2.13_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter) that, in the aggregate, are sufficient for Acquiror to continue after
the Closing to manufacture, develop, brand, market and package the products
of the Snacks Business in all material respects as such products are currently
being manufactured and packaged (taking into account Wimbledon Contracts
relating to manufacture of packaging materials by third parties) by the
Snacks Business in all material respects in the same quantities and respects
to such specifications as such products are currently being manufactured by
the Snacks Business.

(b) Assuming that any required Consents have been obtained, the Wimbledon
Assets will include Permits that, in the aggregate, are sufficient in all
material respects to manufacture, market, develop, sell, brand and package
(taking into account Wimbledon Contracts relating to manufacture of packaging
materials by third parties) the products of the Snacks Business as are
currently being manufactured or currently planned to be manufactured by the
Snacks Business in all material respects.

(c) The Wimbledon Assets and any items made available to the Snacks Business
through the TSA or licensed pursuant to _Section 4.25_, include Intellectual
Property sufficient to manufacture, market, develop, brand and package (taking
into account Wimbledon Contracts relating to manufacture of packaging
materials by third parties) and sell the types of products of the Snacks
Business in all material respects as such products are currently being
manufactured and sold. For purposes of this _Section 2.13(c)_, "sell" or
"sold" will have the meanings given to such terms under applicable Law
related to Intellectual Property. The foregoing will not be deemed (i) a
representation that any of such activities can or will be conducted without
infringement, other violation or use of the Intellectual Property of any
third party, to the

 



26  extent any such representation is made, it is in _Section 2.04_, or (ii) to
apply to any Intellectual Property that is not specifically applicable to the
manufacturing, marketing, developing, selling, branding and packaging of the
products of the Snacks Business as are currently being manufactured or
currently planned to be manufactured by the Snacks Business.

 

(d) The tangible Wimbledon Assets are in good operating condition and repair
(ordinary wear and tear excepted) and have been reasonably maintained
consistent with standards generally followed in the industry and are suitable
for their present uses, except as would not materially adversely affect the
continued conduct of the Snacks Business in all material respects as it is
presently conducted. The plants, buildings and structures included within the
Wimbledon Assets are also structurally sound in all material respects, have
access to public roads or valid easements for such ingress and egress and have
access to water supply, storm and sanitary sewer facilities, telephone, gas
and electrical connections, fire protection and drainage, in each case as
necessary to permit the use of such plants, buildings and structures in the
conduct of the Snacks Business in all material respects as currently
conducted.

2.14 __Real Property__ _._ (a) _Section 2.14(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure

any real property leases or subleases to which the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries is a lessee and with respect to which all of the real property

such real property, the " _Leased Real Property_ "), and (iii) any other real
property that is owned in fee or leased, subleased, licensed or otherwise used
by Seller or any of its Affiliates and utilized by Seller or any of its
Affiliates to manufacture, distribute or sell the products of the Snacks

Real Property_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, "Shared Operational Real
Property" will not be deemed to include any real property utilized by Sellers
"Global Business Services" unit to provide support to the Snacks Business.

(b) True and complete copies of all Real Property Leases have been made
available to Acquiror. Each Real Property Lease is a valid and binding
agreement of Seller or its Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, is in full force and effect and enforceable by Seller or
such Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, except as is not, individually
or in the aggregate, material to the Snacks Business. Except as has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Snacks Business MAE, each of Seller and its Subsidiaries has
performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under the
Real Property Leases to which it is a party and is not (with or without the
lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in breach or default
thereunder and, to Sellers Knowledge, no other party is in breach or default
under any such Real Property Lease _._

 



27 (c) Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller has valid fee title to all Owned Real
Property, subject to no Security Interests except for Permitted Encumbrances.

any governmental decree or order to be sold or being condemned, expropriated
or otherwise taken by any public authority with or without payment of
compensation therefor nor, to Sellers Knowledge, has any condemnation,
expropriation or taking been proposed, except as would not be material to the
Snacks Business. There is no pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened,
Action that would interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the Owned Real
Property or the Leased Real Property.

2.15 __Environmental Matters_._ __ Notwithstanding any other representation or
warranty contained in this _Article II_ , the representations and warranties
contained in this _Section 2.15_ constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of Seller relating to compliance with or
Liability under any Environmental Law, Releases of Hazardous Materials and
any other environmental matters. Except as would not have or reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Snacks Business MAE, to
Sellers Knowledge:

 

(a) Insofar as it relates to the Snacks Business (including the Owned Real
Property, Leased Real Property and Shared Operational Real Property
(collectively, the " _Real Property_ ")), Seller and each of its Subsidiaries,
are in compliance with all Environmental Laws and any Permits required
pursuant to Environmental Law;

all the issued and outstanding capital stock of each Wimbledon Entity and are
owned of record and beneficially by the holders (which holders are either
Seller or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller), free and clear of all Security
Interests. There are no shares of capital stock, voting securities or other
equity securities of any Wimbledon Entity issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding, other than the shares of capital stock owned by Seller or a
Subsidiary of Seller. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller will transfer valid title
to, and Acquiror will own, all the Wimbledon Entity Interests, free and clear
of all Security Interests other than those imposed by applicable securities
laws. All Wimbledon Entity Interests are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. There are no outstanding or authorized options,
warrants, rights (including repurchase rights, rights of first refusal, 

 



28  redemption rights and "tag-along" and "drag-along" rights), "phantom" stock
rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance units,
undertakings, calls, subscriptions, claims of any character, agreements,
obligations, convertible or exchangeable securities, or other commitments,
contingent or otherwise, (" _Capital Interests_ ") relating to Wimbledon
Entity Interests or any capital stock equivalent or other nominal interest in
any of the Wimbledon Entities (collectively, " _Wimbledon Equity Interests_ ")
pursuant to which such Wimbledon Entities are or may become obligated to (a)
issue, deliver, redeem, acquire or sell, or caused to be issued, delivered,
redeemed, acquired or sold, any Wimbledon Entity Interests or any other shares
of their capital stock or other equity interests or any securities convertible

Wimbledon Equity Interests, (b) provide funds to or make any equity investment
in any other Person or (c) grant, issue, adopt or enter into any such
Wimbledon Equity Interest. There is no outstanding Indebtedness that could

exercisable for the Wimbledon Entity Interests or any Wimbledon Equity
Interest. There are no voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or
other agreements or undertakings in effect with respect to the voting,
dividend rights or transfer of any of the Wimbledon Equity Interests.

Acquisition LLC, dated as of April 5, 2011 (the " _Diamond Agreement_ ") is
terminated in accordance with its terms, and (b) each of the parties thereto
unconditionally released the other party for claims specified therein. No

and the Ancillary Agreements, neither Seller nor any other Person makes any
other express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of Seller or

Wimbledon Entities) ability to own, operate or exercise rights in respect of,
the Wimbledon Assets where the effect of such sale, divestiture, license,
transfer, disposition, encumbrance, hold separate arrangement or other
restriction would be materially adverse to the business, financial condition
or results of operations of the Snacks Business (a " _Regulatory MAC_ ").

(b) Seller and Acquiror will comply fully with all applicable notification,
reporting and other requirements. Seller and Acquiror (i) unless otherwise
agreed by the Parties, within 30 Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, will file the required notifications with the appropriate
Governmental Authorities pursuant to and in compliance with the HSR Act and
(ii) will make all other filings required under Antitrust Laws as promptly as
practicable. Seller and Acquiror will as promptly as practicable file
any additional information or documentary material requested by any
Governmental Authority.

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 4.02(a)_ and _4.02(d)_
, Seller and Acquiror will each use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
soon as practicable, the Governmental Approvals that may be or become
necessary for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and will cooperate fully with each other in promptly
seeking to obtain such Governmental Approvals. Acquiror and Seller
will cooperate in connection with the antitrust defense of the transactions
contemplated hereby in any investigation or litigation by, or negotiations
with, any Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby or regulatory filings under applicable Antitrust Laws.
Without

 



36  limiting the foregoing and subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Authority, each of Seller and Acquiror agrees
to (i) cooperate and consult with each other, (ii) furnish to the other such
necessary information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any notifications or filings, (iii) keep
each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications received by such party from, or
given by such party to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority
with respect to such transactions, (iv) permit the other party to review and
incorporate the other partys reasonable comments in any communication to be
given by it to any Governmental Authority with respect to obtaining the
necessary approvals for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(v) not to participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by
telephone, with any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby unless, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Authority, it gives the other party the opportunity to
attend and observe.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants contained in
_Section 4.02(c)_ and subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections
4.02(a)_ , Acquiror will offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit
to take) all necessary steps to eliminate impediments under any Antitrust Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to prevent the entry of any Order sought
by any Governmental Authority or private Person under any Antitrust Law that
would result in the failure of any condition to the obligations of the Parties
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby to be satisfied; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror will be permitted to take such actions
as it may deem desirable to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any Order under any Antitrust Law that would restrain or prevent
the Closing, including defending through litigation any claim asserted in any
court or proceeding by any Person; and _provided further_ , _however_ , that
Acquiror will not be required to offer or agree to sell, divest, dispose of or
take such other action where the effect of such sale, divestiture,
disposition or other action would constitute a Regulatory MAC. If Acquiror is
not able to avoid the entry of any order under any Antitrust Law that would
restrain or prevent the Closing from occurring prior to the End Date, then
Acquiror will propose, negotiate, cooperate with Seller, and effect (or permit
Seller to effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of the Snacks
Business (or otherwise take any action that limits the freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain the Snacks Business) as may be required
in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
prior to the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror will not
be required to offer or agree to sell, divest, dispose of or take such other
action with respect to the Assets or businesses of the Snacks Business where
the effect of such sale, divestiture, disposition or other action would
constitute a Regulatory MAC.

 



37 4.03 __Public Announcements__. Seller and Acquiror agree that the
press release(s) announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby will be in the form(s) attached as

publish any other public statements (including to securities analysts) that
contradicts the Transaction Announcement with respect to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby (or the portion
thereof relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby) without the prior approval of the other
Party, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
except as such Party determines in good faith may be required by Law in
connection with obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange.

 

4.04 __Notification Of Certain Matters__. (a) Each of Seller and Acquiror will

supplemented or updated; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such supplement or
update will (i) be considered or taken into account for purposes of
determining whether the condition set forth in  _Section 6.02(c)_ has been
satisfied or (ii) limit or otherwise affect any of Acquirors indemnification
or other rights under this Agreement, or Sellers indemnification or other
obligations under this Agreement;  _provided_ , _further_ , that no such
updates will include the removal of any Assets from those listed as Wimbledon

4.05 __Access; Permits__. (a) From the date hereof to the Closing, to the
extent permitted by Law, Seller will allow all designated officers,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives of Acquiror, access at
reasonable times upon reasonable notice to the personnel, books, records,
files, correspondence, audits and properties, as well as to all information
relating to commitments, contracts, coupon activities, promotional programs,
titles and financial position, or otherwise pertaining to the business and
affairs of the Snacks Business including as to matters that might arise
outside the Ordinary Course; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no
investigation pursuant to this _Section 4.05_ will affect any representation
or warranty given by Seller hereunder or any closing condition, indemnity
obligation or other provision and (ii) notwithstanding the provision of
information or investigation by Seller, Seller will not be deemed to make any
representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) Seller will not be required to provide any
information

 



38  which it determines in good faith it may not provide to Acquiror by reason
of applicable Law (including any information in confidential personnel files),
or which Seller determines in good faith constitutes information protected by
attorney/client privilege; _provided_ , that Seller hereby agrees that as of
the date of this Agreement no such information related to the Snacks Business
is material and _provided_ , _further_ , that if any information is so
prohibited to be provided, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take those actions reasonably necessary so that Seller is able to provide such
information to Acquiror as promptly as possible, (B) Seller will not be
required to provide access to any performance review materials or any
information from personnel files that relates to an employees participation
in bonus plans and similar incentive compensation arrangements (other than
individual bonus opportunities based on target bonus as a percentage of base

properties in a manner that will result in damage to such property or for the
purpose of performing any onsite procedure or investigation (including any

The Parties will make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions in clauses (A)
through (B) of the preceding sentence apply. Each of Seller and Acquiror
agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective Representatives not
to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 4.05_ for any
purpose unrelated to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. All
information provided by a Party to the other Party hereunder will be
kept confidential to the same extent as would be applicable if the
Confidentiality Agreements were in effect.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller and Acquiror will cooperate in good faith to
identify all material Permits required to operate the Snacks Business as
currently conducted. To the extent any Permit so identified is not exclusive
to the Snacks Business, and solely to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Seller will provide Acquiror with reasonable cooperation and assistance in
Acquirors efforts to obtain replacement Permits.

4.06 __Further Assurances__. Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
4.02_:

(a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, each of the Parties will cooperate
with each other and use (and will cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to use) reasonable best efforts, prior to, at and after the

to be done, all things reasonably necessary on its part permitted
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly as
reasonably practicable.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 4.06(a)_, where the
cooperation of third parties such as insurers or trustees would be necessary
in order for a Party to completely fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, such Party will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such third Parties to provide such cooperation. If
any Affiliate of Seller is not a party to this 

 



39  Agreement or, as applicable, any Ancillary Agreement, and it becomes
necessary or desirable for such Affiliate to be a party hereto or thereto to
carry out the purpose hereof or thereof, then Seller will cause such
Affiliate to become a party hereto or thereto or cause such Affiliate to
undertake such actions as if such Affiliate were such a party.

4.07 __Agreement For Exchange Of Information__. (a) _Generally_. (i) Except
as otherwise provided in the TSA, each Party, on behalf of its respective
Group, will provide, or cause to be provided, to the other Partys Group, at
any time after the Closing Date and until the sixth anniversary of the Closing
Date, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request therefor, any

Acquiror agree to make their respective personnel available during regular
business hours to discuss the Information exchanged pursuant to this _Section
4.07_.

 

(ii) Each Party will provide to the other such Information as the other may
from time to time reasonably request in order to prepare its financial
statements and satisfy its public reporting obligations, including such
information as such Party may reasonably request and is known or reasonably
available upon due inquiry to the other Party with respect to Wimbledon
Liabilities for which Seller is directly or contingently liable or
Liabilities for which Acquiror is directly or contingently liable. For the
avoidance of doubt, Information with respect to the category of such
Liabilities and the annual future payments over the minimum contract term and
any renewal terms will be deemed reasonable requests by a Party.

(b) _Ownership Of Information_. Any Information owned by a Party that is
provided to the other Party pursuant to this _Section 4.07_ remains the
property of the Party that owned and provided such Information. Each Party
will, and will cause members of their respective Groups to, remove and
destroy any hard drives or other electronic data storage devices from any
computer or server that is reasonably likely to contain Information that is
protected by this _Section 4.07_ and that is transferred or sold to a third
party or otherwise disposed of in accordance with _Section 4.07(c)_, unless
required by Law or bona fide document retention policies to retain such
materials.

 

(c) _Record Retention_. Each Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to retain all Information that relates to the operations of the
Snacks Business in its respective possession or control at the Closing in
accordance with their respective then existing document retention policies, as
such policies may be amended from time to time.

 

(d) _Other Agreements Providing For Exchange Of Information_. The rights and
obligations granted under this _Section 4.07_ are subject to any specific
limitations, qualifications or additional provisions on the sharing, exchange
or confidential treatment of Information set forth in this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement.

 

(e) _Compensation For Providing Information_. The Party requesting Information
will reimburse the other Party for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs, if
any,

 



40  of creating, gathering and copying such Information, to the extent that such
costs are incurred for the benefit of the requesting Party.

 

(f) _Production Of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation_.

(i) After the Closing Date, except in the case of any Action by one Party or
its Affiliates against another Party or its Affiliates, each Party will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to make available to each other Party,
upon written request, the former, current and future directors, officers,
employees, other personnel and agents of the members of its respective Group
as witnesses and any books, records or other documents within its control or
which it otherwise has the ability to make available, to the extent that any
such person (giving consideration to business demands of such directors,
officers, employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other
documents are reasonably requested in connection with any Action in which the
requesting Party may from time to time be involved, regardless of whether such
Action is a matter with respect to which indemnification may be sought
hereunder.

 

(ii) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise or
settle any Third-Party Claim, the other Party will make available to such
Indemnifying Party, upon written request, the former, current and future
directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents of the members of
its respective Group as witnesses and any books, records or other
documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make
available, to the extent that any such person (giving consideration to
business demands of such directors, officers, employees, other personnel and
agents) or books, records or other documents are reasonably requested in
connection with such defense, settlement or compromise, or the prosecution,
evaluation or pursuit thereof, as the case may be, and will otherwise
cooperate in such defense, settlement or compromise, or such prosecution,
evaluation or pursuit, as the case may be.

(iii) Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties will cooperate and consult
to the extent reasonably necessary with respect to Third-Party Claims.

(iv) The obligation of the Parties to provide witnesses pursuant to this
_Section 4.07_ is intended to be interpreted in a manner so as to facilitate
cooperation and will include the obligation to provide as witnesses inventors
and other officers without regard to whether the witness or the employer of
the witness could assert a possible business conflict.

(g) _Restrictions_. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, no Party or member of such Partys Group grants or
confers rights of license in any Information owned by any member of such
Partys Group to any member of the other Partys Group hereunder.

4.08 __Privileged Matters__. (a) The respective rights and obligations of the
Parties to maintain, preserve, assert or waive any or all privileges
belonging to either Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Snacks
Business or the Non-Snacks Business, including the attorney-client and work
product privileges (collectively, 

 



41  " _Privileges_ "), will be governed by the provisions of this _Section
4.08_. With respect to Privileged Information of Seller or relating
exclusively to Pre-Closing Liabilities or exclusively to Excluded
Liabilities, Seller will have sole authority in perpetuity to determine
whether to assert or waive any or all Privileges, and Acquiror will not take
any action (or permit any of its Affiliates to take action) without the prior
written consent of Seller that would reasonably be expected to result in any
waiver of any Privilege that could be asserted by Seller or any member of its
Group under applicable Law and this Agreement. With respect to
Privileged Information solely of the Snacks Business or otherwise arising
after the Closing Date, Acquiror will have sole authority in perpetuity to
determine whether to assert or waive any or all Privileges, and Seller will
take no action (nor permit any of its Affiliates to take action) without the
prior written consent of Acquiror that would reasonably be expected to result
in any waiver of any Privilege that could be asserted by Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates under applicable Law and this Agreement. The rights and
obligations created by this _Section 4.08_ will apply to all Information as
to which a Party or its Affiliates would be entitled to assert or have
asserted a Privilege without regard to the effect, if any, of
the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Privileged Information_ ").

Information regarding the Non-Snacks Business and the Seller Group (other than
Snacks Business Information), whether or not such Information (other than
Snacks Business Information) is in the possession of Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates, (ii) all communications subject to a Privilege between counsel for
Seller (including any person who, at the time of the communication, was an
employee of Seller or its Group in the capacity of in-house counsel,
regardless of whether such employee is or becomes an employee of Acquiror or
any of its Affiliates) and any person who, at the time of the communication,
was an employee of Seller, regardless of whether such employee is or becomes
an employee of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates but not Snacks Business
Information, and (iii) all Information generated, received or arising after
the Closing Date that refers or relates to and discloses Privileged
Information of Seller or its Group generated, received or arising prior to
the Closing Date but not Snacks Business Information.

(c) Privileged Information of the Snacks Business includes (i) any and all
Information exclusively relating to the Snacks Business and the Wimbledon
Entities (including Acquiror and its Affiliates) (the " _Snacks Business
Information_ "), whether or not it is in the possession of Seller or any
member of its Group, (ii) all communications subject to a Privilege occurring
after the Closing Date between counsel for the Snacks Business (including in-

any person who, at the time of the communication, was an employee of the
Snacks Business regardless of whether such employee was, is or becomes an
employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) all Information
generated, received or arising after the Closing Date that refers or relates
to and discloses Privileged Information of the Snacks Business generated,
received or arising after the Closing Date.

 



42 (d) Upon receipt by Seller or Acquiror, or any of their respective Affiliates,
as the case may be, of any subpoena, discovery or other request from any
third party that actually or arguably calls for the production or disclosure
of Privileged Information of the other or if Seller or Acquiror, or any of
their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, obtains knowledge that any
current or former employee of Seller or Acquiror, as the case may be, receives
any subpoena, discovery or other request from any third party that actually or
arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged Information of
the other, Seller or Acquiror, as the case may be, will promptly notify the
relevant other Party of the existence of the request and will provide such
Party a reasonable opportunity to review the Information and to assert any
rights it may have under this _Section 4.08_ or otherwise to prevent the
production or disclosure of Privileged Information. Seller or Acquiror, as the
case may be, will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not to,
produce or disclose to any third party any of the other Partys Privileged
Information under this _Section 4.08_ unless (i) the other has provided its
express written consent to such production or disclosure or (ii) a court
of competent jurisdiction has entered an Order finding that the Information
is not entitled to protection from disclosure under any applicable privilege,
doctrine or rule.

(e) Sellers transfer of books and records pertaining to the Snacks Business
and other Information to Acquiror, Sellers agreement to permit Acquiror to
obtain Information existing prior to the Closing Date, and Acquirors
agreement to permit Seller to obtain Information existing prior to the Closing
Date are made in reliance on Sellers and Acquirors respective agreements, as
set forth in _Section 4.07_ and this  _Section 4.08_, to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information and to take the steps provided herein for
the preservation of all Privileges that may belong to or be asserted by Seller
or Acquiror, as the case may be. The access to Information, witnesses and
individuals being granted pursuant to _Section 4.07_ and the disclosure to
Seller and Acquiror of Privileged Information relating to the Snacks Business
or the Non-Snacks Business pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby will not be asserted by Seller or Acquiror to
constitute, or otherwise deemed, a waiver of any Privilege that has been or
may be asserted under this _Section 4.08_ or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement will operate to reduce, minimize or condition the rights granted to
Seller and Acquiror in, or the obligations imposed upon Seller and Acquiror
by, this _Section 4.08_.

documents required in connection with the Financing, (ii) participating in
meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions, (iii) reviewing materials

requested, (v) as promptly as reasonably practicable providing monthly and
quarterly interim financial 

 



43  statements and (vi) providing any other financial information reasonably
requested by Acquiror.

4.10 __Non-Solicitation; No Hiring__ _._ Seller agrees that for a period of 24
months from the Closing Date, Seller will not, and will cause each other
member of the Seller Group not to, without obtaining the prior written
consent of Acquiror, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or employ
(or refer to another Person for the purpose of such Person soliciting for
employment or employing) any Continuing Employee (after giving effect to any
employee transfers contemplated in this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) no member of the Seller Group will be deemed to have solicited any
such person who is an employee of the Acquiror Group and responds to any
general media advertisement or job posting placed by on behalf of Seller or
any member of the Seller Group or such person is contacted by an employment
search firm engaged by Seller or a member of the Seller Group that is not
specifically directed to solicit persons employed by Acquiror or the Acquiror
Group and such contact is initiated without the involvement or knowledge of a
Senior Executive of Seller, the Seller Group or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and such employee is not hired by Seller or its Affiliates and
(ii) any member of the Seller Group may solicit and hire any such person who

responsible for, and will pay all expenses (whether incurred before or after
the Closing) involved in notarization, authentication, legalization
and/or consularization of the signatures of any of the representatives of its
Group on any of the Transfer Documents relating to the transfer of
Intellectual Property. Acquiror will be responsible for, and will pay all
expenses (whether incurred before or after the Closing) relating to, the
recording of any such Transfer Documents relating to the transfer of
Intellectual Property to any member of the Acquiror Group with any
Governmental Authorities as may be necessary or appropriate.

 

4.12 __Use Of Seller Names And Marks__. (a) " _Seller Names and Marks_ " means
the names and marks "Procter and Gamble" and "PandG" (in any style or design),
and any Trademark derived from, confusingly similar to or including any of the
foregoing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section
4.12_, Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as necessary, grants to
the Wimbledon Entities a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive royalty-free
license to use the Seller Names and Marks solely in the manner and for the
duration specified in this _Section 4.12_. Except as expressly provided in
this _Section 4.12_, Seller reserves for itself and its Affiliates all rights
in the Seller Names and Marks, and no other rights therein are granted to any
Wimbledon Entity, member of the Acquiror Group, or any of their respective
Affiliates, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All use of the
Seller Names and Marks by the Wimbledon Entities shall inure to the benefit of
Seller and its Affiliates.

 

(b) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within
six months of the Closing Date, Acquiror will, and will cause the other

domain names and from the content of any internet websites within the
Wimbledon Assets, and remove all links to any internet domains of Seller or
any of its Affiliates from any of the foregoing.

(c) In each applicable jurisdiction, as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, and in any event within nine months of the Closing Date,
Acquiror will, and will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group to,
remove or irreversibly cover or modify all Seller Names and Marks from
or destroy any packaging bearing any of the Seller Names and Marks.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in each jurisdiction, Wimbledon Entities may
continue to sell existing inventories of finished goods included in the
Wimbledon Assets packaged in packaging bearing the Seller Names and Marks
until the expiration of the applicable shelf lives of such products;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror and its Affiliates use their
commercially reasonable efforts to sell such existing inventories prior to
the sale of subsequently manufactured or packaged products.

(d) In each applicable jurisdiction, as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, and in any event within nine months of the Closing Date,
Acquiror will, and will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group to, (i)

destroy any product literature, store displays and similar materials bearing
any of the Seller Names and Marks.

(e) For all other uses of the Seller Names and Marks not specifically
identified in _Sections 4.12(b)  (d)_ ( _e.g._ , signage, business cards and
stationery), for up to 90 days after the Closing Date, in each applicable
jurisdiction the Wimbledon Entities may continue to use the Seller Names and
Trademarks on the same materials and in substantially the same manner as used
by the Snacks Business during the 90-day period preceding the Closing. In each
applicable jurisdiction, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date,
and, in any event within 90 days after the Closing Date, Acquiror will, and
will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group to, remove or irreversibly
cover or modify all Seller Names and Marks from or destroy any such other
materials bearing any of the Seller Names and Marks.

(f) In no event will any of the Wimbledon Entities use, and Acquiror will,
and will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group to not use, any of the
Seller Names and Marks after the Closing in any manner or for any purpose
different from the use of such Seller Names and Marks by the Snacks Business
during the 90-day period preceding the Closing. Without limiting the
generality or effect of the foregoing, all products sold using any Seller Name
or Mark will be of high quality, consistent in nature and quality with such
products as sold by the Snacks Business in the 90-day period preceding
Closing. Seller reserves the right to reasonably inspect the Wimbledon
Entities quality control of the products sold bearing and uses of a Seller
Name or Mark and other compliance with the terms of the license granted under
this _Section 4.12_.

 



45 (g) The license granted under this _Section 4.12_ may be terminated by
written notice if Acquiror or any Wimbledon Entity is in material breach of
any provision hereof that remains uncured for more than 10 days after written
notice thereof from Seller. Upon such termination of the license granted

members of the Acquiror Group to not use, any of the Seller Names and Marks.

the Closing to a Wimbledon Facility. If such Wimbledon Assets are not moved
prior to the Closing, then Seller shall cause such Wimbledon Assets to be
moved as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date from such facilities,
at Sellers expense and delivered to a facility of Acquiror, as directed by
Acquiror, and in a manner so as not to cause substantial damage to such
Wimbledon Assets ( _provided_ , that Acquiror shall be responsible for the
installation of such property within its facilities. Acquiror will remove

the Parties, all tangible Excluded Assets that are located at any of the
Wimbledon Facilities will be moved as promptly as practicable after the
Closing from such facilities, at Sellers expense and in a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with the operations of any member of the Acquiror
Group and to not cause substantial damage to such Wimbledon Facility, and such
member of the Acquiror Group will provide reasonable access to such Wimbledon
Facility to effectuate such movement. Seller will remove any Excluded Assets
that remain at any such Wimbledon Facilities in connection with the
performance of services under the TSA as promptly as practicable after the
termination of such service pursuant to the same terms and conditions stated
in the immediately preceding sentence.

each provide, and will cause each of their Affiliates to provide, and will

and other processes necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated
hereby, which will include any required notifications and consultations and
other processes with respect to any works council, economic committee, union
or similar body as required to either (i) obtain an opinion or acknowledgment
from any works council, economic committee, union or similar body or (ii)
establish that the Parties are permitted to effect the transactions
contemplated hereby without such opinion or acknowledgment. Such cooperation
will include the provision of any information and consultation required
by applicable Law, the terms of any Contract, or as reasonably requested by
the other Party. Each of Acquiror and Seller will make

 



46  available its representatives at such times and in such places as the other
Party may reasonably request for purposes of discussions with representatives
of any such works council, economic committee, union or similar body.

(b) Other than as provided under Section _4.01(b)(xiv)_ , between signing of
this Agreement and the Closing, neither Seller nor any member of the Seller
Group will, without the prior written consent of Acquiror, enter or offer to
enter into any agreement with any works council, economic committee, union or
similar body which would have the effect of making any changes in the terms
and conditions of employment or pension benefits of any of the Continuing
Employees.

4.15 __Insurance Matters__. From and after the Closing, Acquiror will not, and
will cause its Affiliates not to, assert any claim against any insurance
policies or practices of Seller and its Affiliates under any captive
insurance policies, fronted insurance policies, surety bonds or corporate
insurance policies or practices, or any form of self-insurance whatsoever;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Seller and Acquiror agree that all claims
with respect to insured events occurring prior to the Closing will be
administered in accordance with the terms of Sellers or its Subsidiaries
third-party policies and coverage applicable to such claims and (b) Acquiror
will receive the benefit of such policies with respect to such claims to the
extent losses occurring prior to the Closing are covered notwithstanding the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
provided that such recovery will be net of any deductibles, self-insured
retention, costs of any retroactive insurance premiums or other amounts paid
or expenses incurred in connection with any insured claims made after the
Closing under any such policies that relate to the period prior to Closing.

4.16 __Outsourced Items__. (a) _Outsourced Equipment_. Acquiror acknowledges
that the Outsourced Equipment is currently leased from the Outsourcing
Companies and is not included in the Wimbledon Assets. Prior to the Closing,
Acquiror may enter into an agreement with the Outsourcing Companies to
purchase the Outsourced Equipment effective as of the Closing (or, as of the
expiration of the relevant service under the TSA, in the case of any
Outsourced Equipment used to provide such services). As soon as practicable
following the Closing (or, following the expiration of the relevant service
under the TSA, in the case of any Outsourced Equipment used to provide such
services) on the terms and subject to the conditions contemplated by the
Outsourcing Agreements (or such other terms and conditions that Acquiror is
able to negotiate with Outsourcing Companies), subject to receipt of
confirmation from the Outsourcing Companies that Acquiror has purchased the
Outsourced Equipment, Seller will make the Outsourced Equipment available to
Acquiror. Promptly upon taking possession of any Outsourced Equipment,
Acquiror will remove all software from the Outsourced Equipment except for any
Intellectual Property and Software to which Acquiror acquires rights pursuant
to this  _Section 4.16(a)_ and, to the extent of any remaining term for the
applicable services, any software Acquiror is expressly permitted to use
pursuant to the TSA.

(b) _Certain Non-U.S. Employee Vehicles_. _Section 4.16(b)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of any leased motor vehicles used or held
for use by a 

 



47  Continuing Employee as of the date of this Agreement where such Continuing
Employee is a lessee but lease payments are made (or reimbursed) by Seller or
its Affiliates (the " _Reimbursed Auto Leases_ "). Prior to the Closing,
Seller and Acquiror will cooperate in good faith with respect to the transfer
to Acquiror and its Affiliates of all post-Closing obligations of Seller and
its Affiliates under any Reimbursed Auto Lease so that from and after the
Closing all Continuing Employees may continue to use any motor vehicles
subject to a Reimbursed Auto Lease.

4.17 __Confidentiality__. (a) The Parties acknowledge that in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Parties have disclosed to each other
Information which the Parties consider proprietary and confidential. The
Parties agree that, after the Closing, Information that constitutes a
Wimbledon Asset will be Information of Acquiror and Acquiror will not be
subject to this _Section 4.17_ with respect to such information and Seller
will be deemed to be the Receiving Party of such Information for purposes of
_Section 4.17(b)_.

(b) Each Party receiving Information (the " _Receiving Party_ ") recognizes
and acknowledges: (A) that Information of the other Party may be commercially
valuable proprietary products of such Party, the design and development of
which may have involved the expenditure of substantial amounts of money and
the use of skilled development experts over a long period of time and which
afford such Party a commercial advantage over its competitors; (B) that the
loss of this competitive advantage due to unauthorized disclosure or use of
Information of such Party may cause great injury and harm to such Party; and
(C) that the restrictions imposed upon the Parties under this _Section 4.17_
are necessary to protect the secrecy of Information and to prevent the
occurrence of such injury and harm. The Parties agree that:

(i) disclosure of Information will be received and held in confidence by the
Receiving Party and that such Receiving Party will not, without the prior
written consent of the Party from whom such Information was obtained (the "
_Disclosing Party_ "), disclose, divulge or permit any unauthorized Person to
obtain any Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party (whether or not such
Information is in written or tangible form); 

(ii) the Receiving Party will take such steps as may be reasonably necessary
to prevent the disclosure of Information to others; and

(iii) the Receiving Party will use the Information only in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby unless otherwise authorized in writing by
the Disclosing Party.

(c) The commitments set forth above will not extend to any portion of
Information:

(i) which is already known to the Receiving Party other than any member of
Seller Group with respect to Information related to the Snacks Business or
any of the Wimbledon Entities, or is information generally available to the
public;

 



48 (ii) which, hereafter, through no act on the part of the Receiving Party or
its representatives becomes generally available to the public;

(iii) which corresponds in substance to a disclosure furnished to the
Receiving Party by any third party having a bona fide right to do so and not
having any confidential obligation, direct or indirect, to the Disclosing
Party with respect to the same; or

 

(iv) which is required to be disclosed by Law; _provided_ that the Receiving
Party provides reasonable prior written notice of such required disclosure to
the Disclosing Party following the Receiving Partys knowledge of such
requirement in order to provide the Disclosing Party with an opportunity to
prevent or limit such disclosure by seeking a protective order or
other appropriate remedy at the sole expense of the Disclosing Party.

4.18 _Shared Contracts_. (a) _Section 4.18(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter contains a list of Contracts with third parties that relate to the
Snacks Business but that are not exclusive to the Snacks Business, including
with suppliers of goods and services to the Snacks Business as well as
distributors of both Snacks Business products and other Seller products (the "
_Shared Business Contracts_ ").

(b) Seller agrees, at Acquirors request, to use reasonable best efforts to
cause each Shared Business Contract to be assigned in part to a Wimbledon
Entity prior to the Closing Date or to appropriately amend such Shared
Business Contract so that Acquiror shall, at and following the Closing, be
entitled to the rights and benefits inuring to the Snacks Business under such
Shared Business Contracts. In addition Seller will provide Acquiror with
contact information for such third parties and introduce representatives of
Acquiror to the Seller contacts at such third parties.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller will use reasonable best efforts to obtain
the consent (without charge to Acquiror) of any advertising agency or similar
party to the assignment to Acquiror, as of the Effective Time, of the right
to use previously created Snack Business advertising and promotional content.

(d) To the extent that any supplier, distributor or other counterparty
violates or otherwise breached any Shared Business Contract prior to the
Closing Date, and such violation or other breach gives rise to the right of
any member of the Seller Group that is a party thereto to assert any Action
against such counterparty, Acquiror may, from and after the Closing, elect to
give notice of such fact to Seller, in which event Acquiror and Seller will
negotiate in good faith to determine (i) whether and how to proceed with such
Action against such counterparty and (ii) how to allocate the costs of
pursuing such cause of Action and any benefits that might arise from such
Action. It is the intent of the Parties that, in respect of such Shared
Business Contract, the costs of pursuing, and the benefits arising from, such
Action will be allocated between Acquiror and Seller in a manner proportionate
to the recoverable damages incurred by the Snacks Business, on the one hand,
and the other businesses of the Seller Group, on the other hand.

 



49 4.19 __Transition Period Assets__. Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that
in the course of preparing for the implementation of the services
contemplated by the TSA, Seller may identify certain Assets included within
the Wimbledon Assets (the " _Transition Period Assets_ "), that are necessary
or desirable for Seller to retain in order to provide the services
contemplated by the TSA. At Sellers request, Acquiror may elect to (i) allow
Seller to retain possession of such Transition Period Assets during the term
of the TSA solely for purposes of enabling Seller to satisfy its obligations
under the TSA, in which case as soon as practicable following the expiration
of the applicable services contemplated by the TSA, Seller will Convey such
Transition Period Assets to Acquiror for no additional consideration or (ii)
include any Transition Period Assets in the Wimbledon Assets at Closing (in
which case Seller will not be required to provide any service under the TSA
where it is not reasonably practicable to provide such service without such
Transition Period Assets).

4.20 __Covenant Not To Sue__. From and after the Closing Date, Seller
covenants that it will not sue, and it will ensure that none of its Affiliates
or assignees will sue, Acquiror or any of Acquirors Affiliates or direct or
indirect customers, suppliers or distributors for Patent or
Copyright infringement, or trade secret misappropriation based upon the
manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, research, development, marketing,
importation or exportation of products related to the Snacks Business as it is
conducted immediately prior to the Closing or any use by such persons of the
manufacturing process referred to by Seller as "Integrated Work System"
following the Closing, in each case, without the Background IP.

 

4.21 __Notification Of Certain Matters; Disclosure Letter Updates__. Prior to
the Closing, Seller may deliver to Acquiror supplements or updates to the
Seller Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such supplement or
update will (i) be considered or taken into account for purposes of
determining whether the condition set forth in  _Section 6.02(c)_ has been
satisfied or (ii) limit or otherwise affect any of Acquirors indemnification
or other rights under this Agreement or Sellers indemnification or other
obligations under this Agreement. The Parties will reasonably cooperate to
mutually agree on the final schedules attached to the forms of the TSA and the
Facilities Agreement.

4.22 __Amendment Of Termination Agreement__. Seller will not, without the
prior written consent of Acquiror, amend, waive or modify the Termination
Agreement in any manner adverse to Acquiror, any of its Affiliates, or any of
their directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, representatives and
their respective successors and assigns without the prior written consent of
Acquiror.

 

4.23 __Governmental Permits__. Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that in order
for Acquiror to sell Snacks Business products immediately following the
Closing, in lieu of transferring certain Governmental Approvals to Acquiror as
contemplated by _Section 1.05(a)(vi)_, Seller may transfer the Governmental
Approvals identified on _Section 4.23_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter to
the distributors identified therein. The Governmental Approvals identified on
_Section 4.23_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter will not constitute Wimbledon
Governmental Approvals.

 



50 4.24 __Olestra Supply__. Seller and Acquiror will work together in good faith
to agree to the terms for Seller to sell Olestra to Acquiror which terms will
in no event include a price in excess of Sellers cost or a term of less than
three years.

 

4.25 __Shared Intellectual Property__. Seller hereby grants to Acquiror, on
behalf of itself and its applicable Subsidiaries, a non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to all Intellectual Property used
in the Snacks Business as of the Closing Date that is not included in the
Wimbledon Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing will not be
deemed to include a license (a) to any proprietary models for marketing,
branding, consumer research, financial analysis, information technology
systems and personnel management of Seller and its Affiliates, (b) for use of
any Intellectual Property in any business other than the manufacture or sale
of salty snacks products, (c) for the provision of any of the services under
the Transition Services Agreement, or (d) for the Trademarks "PandG", "Procter
and Gamble", similar Trademarks and any other Trademark that includes the name
of Seller or any of its Affiliates or businesses other than the Snacks
Business, the items described in (a), (b), (c) and (d) above collectively
constituting the " _Background IP_." Seller will, within 60 calendar days
following the execution of this Agreement, determine whether there are any
restrictions on the ability of Seller to grant a non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to the Patents identified in
_Section 4.25_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter to Acquiror and its Affiliates
for use after the Closing. To the extent not otherwise restricted, Seller
will grant such a license to the Patents identified in _Section 4.25_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter. In the event Acquiror identifies any other elements
of Intellectual Property used in the Snacks Business as of the Closing Date
that is not included in the Wimbledon Assets that it wishes to use in the
business of the Acquiror and its Affiliates after the Closing, Acquiror will
so notify Seller and the Parties will discuss in good faith the possible
use of such Intellectual Property by Acquiror and its Affiliates after the
Closing. The Parties will enter into such additional documentation as Acquiror
reasonably requests in order to effectuate the foregoing license.

 

4.26 __Other Certain Shared Assets__. (a) _Request For Access_. During the
period from the Closing Date through the second anniversary thereof, Acquiror
may elect to request access to a specific Qualifying Shared Asset or that a
Qualifying Shared Asset be deemed a Wimbledon Asset by sending notice of such
request to Seller (an " _Access Notice_ "), which Access Notice will describe
the requested Qualifying Shared Asset in reasonable detail. For purposes of
this Agreement, a " _Qualifying Shared Asset_ " is an Asset (other than
Intellectual Property) that was primarily utilized in connection with the
Snacks Business prior to the Closing Date and that was utilized by the Seller
Group in connection with activities unrelated to the Snacks Business only in a
de minimis respect.

 

(b) _Negotiation In Good Faith_. In the event that Acquiror requests access to
a Qualifying Shared Asset or a determination that such Qualifying Shared
Asset is a Wimbledon Asset as contemplated by _Section 4.26(a)_, Acquiror and
Seller will negotiate in good faith to determine whether such access can be
provided to Acquiror in a manner consistent with the manner in which such
Qualifying Shared Asset

 



51  was previously made available to the Snacks Business immediately prior to
the Closing or whether such Qualifying Shared Asset shall be deemed a
Wimbledon Asset.

 

4.27 __Belgium Split Plan__.

(a) Following the date hereof, Seller will, in its reasonable discretion in
consultation with Acquiror, develop a plan to separate the Mechelen Facility
from its existing combined site so that the Mechelen Facility can be
transferred as herein contemplated and otherwise provides that with respect to
other portions of the Mechelen Facility that are shared, such portions will be
either split or shared so long as, if split, the employees of Seller and
Acquiror following the Closing are provided with space, employee environment,
functionality, access and related amenities that in the aggregate are
substantially comparable (the "Base Split Plan"). Seller will bear the costs
of implementation of the Base Split Plan. In developing the Base Split Plan,
the decisions of Seller, acting reasonably, will govern. If Acquiror requests
any modification to the Base Split Plan (i) that is solely for its benefit,
then Seller will implement such modifications and Acquiror will bear the
costs necessary to implement such modification to the Base Split Plan and any
other incremental costs incurred in connection with such modification
(including capital investment and all expenses related thereto) and (ii) that
is for the benefit of both Acquiror and Seller, then the parties will discuss
such modifications and the appropriate allocation of costs related thereto in
good faith.

 

(b) Following the date of this Agreement, Seller and Acquiror will cooperate
in connection with the design and implementation of installing and
constructing a new manufacturing line in the Mechelen Facility in Belgium (the
"New Belgium Line"). In addition, Seller will, upon Acquirors request, begin
construction of, and purchase Assets for the installation of, the New Belgium
Line in accordance with Acquirors request. Seller will invoice and Acquiror
will pay for such capital costs, amounts expensed, engineering and related
personnel costs to the extent they would have been included in project
costs had the project been executed by the Snacks Business of Seller, which
were incurred by Seller at Acquirors request; provided, that if this
Agreement is terminated and the Closing does not occur, Seller will reimburse
Acquiror for all amounts paid by Acquiror in connection therewith within 30
days following the date of termination.

V. EMPLOYEE MATTERS 

5.01 __Identification Of Employees__. From time to time until 20 calendar days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller may (and shall to the extent necessary to
facilitate Acquirors obligations under this _Article V_ (including any
schedule thereto)) update _Section 2.08(b)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter in order to maintain the accuracy of _Section 2.08(b)(i)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, including as a result of terminations, transfers,
new hires and accidental or inadvertent errors or omissions (in each case,
subject to Sellers compliance with  _Section 4.01(b)(xiii)_ of this
Agreement), highlighting such changes. Not more than 20 and not less than 10
calendar days prior to Closing, Seller shall provide a then current, true and
complete version of _Section 2.08(b)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
taking into account any terminations, transfers, new hires and

 



52  accidental or inadvertent errors or omissions (in each case, subject to
Sellers compliance with _Section 4.01(b)(xiii)_ of this Agreement),
highlighting such changes since the last provided _Section 2.08(b)(i)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, Seller may, in its sole discretion,
cause the employment of any In-Scope Employee to be transferred to any
Wimbledon Entity at any time prior to the Closing, subject to Sellers
compliance with _Section 4.01(b)(xiii)_ of this Agreement.

5.02 _Continuity Of Employment_. (a) Seller and Acquiror hereby acknowledge
that it is in their mutual best interest for there to be continuity of
employment by Acquiror or its Affiliates following the Closing with respect
to: (i) each In-Scope Employee (other than any Double-Choice Employee) and
(ii) each Double-Choice Employee who accepts an offer of employment from the
Acquiror Group as of the Closing (in each case, other than any employee whose
employment with Seller or its Affiliates terminated prior to the Closing)
(collectively, " _Snacks Business Employees_ ").

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Seller will transfer the employment of each
In-Scope Employee (other than any Double-Choice Employee and other than any
In-Scope Employee based in the United States (a " _US In-Scope Employee_ "))
to a Wimbledon Entity. Seller will take all actions necessary to provide that
as of the Closing Date (i) no Wimbledon Entity will employ or will have any
Liability or obligation to employ any individual who is not an In-Scope
Employee and (ii) neither Acquiror nor any Acquiror Affiliate will have any
obligation to employ any such employee and Seller and its Affiliates will
assume and retain all Liability with respect to the actions contemplated by
clauses (i) and (ii).

(c) Not less than 30 calendar days prior to the Closing Date, Acquiror will,
or will cause one of its Affiliates to, make an offer of employment to each
Double-Choice Employee and each US In-Scope Employee; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Parties acknowledge that any Double-Choice Employee or US In-Scope
Employee may elect not to accept any offer of employment from Acquiror or its
Affiliates (including the Wimbledon Entities). Any Double-Choice Employee or
US In-Scope Employee who fails to accept an offer of employment from Acquiror
or one of its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date will remain an employee of
Seller or one of its Affiliates.

(d) Each Snacks Business Employee who continues employment or accepts
employment with Acquiror or its Affiliates (including the Wimbledon Entities)
(the applicable entity, the " _Employing Entity_ ") immediately following the
Closing is referred to herein as a " _Continuing Employee_." Each Continuing
Employee who is based in the United States is referred to as a " _US
Continuing Employee_ ," and each Continuing Employee who is based outside of
the United States is referred to as a " _Non-US Continuing Employee_."

(e) Nothing herein will be construed as a representation or guarantee
by Seller or any of its Affiliates that (i) some or all of the Double-Choice
Employees or US In-Scope Employees will accept an offer of employment with
Acquiror or one of Acquirors Affiliates (including the Wimbledon Entities)
or (ii) some or all of the In-Scope

 



53  Employees will become employed by or continue in employment with Acquiror or
one of Acquirors Affiliates (including the Wimbledon Entities) for any period
of time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, unless prohibited by applicable Law,
in the event that an In-Scope Employee (other than any Double-Choice Employee)
refuses employment with Acquiror or one of Acquirors Affiliates (the terms
and conditions of which employment are consistent with the provisions of
_Section 5.03_ (including any schedule thereto)), Seller will or will cause
its Affiliates to terminate the employment of such employee with Seller and
its Affiliates and; _provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding _Section 4.10_, Seller will not hire any such employee for 12
months following such termination.

(f) Not less than 30 calendar days prior to the Closing Date, Acquiror will,
or will cause one of its Affiliates to, present its terms and conditions of
employment (including base salary and target bonus opportunity and such other
terms as Acquiror reasonably determines) to the In-Scope Employees, which
terms and conditions will be consistent with the provisions of _Section 5.03_
(including any schedule thereto). Subject to applicable Law, Seller and
Acquiror will reasonably cooperate in connection with the presentation of such
terms and conditions of employment to the In-Scope Employees, including with
respect to the timing thereof. __

 

(g) Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that (i) certain of the Snacks Business
Employees may be eligible for retirement or "special separation" benefits
from Seller or its Affiliates as of the Closing under the terms and conditions
of Sellers general employment policies (the " _Special Separation Benefits_
"), (ii) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, such Snacks Business Employees may retire from
Seller or receive Special Separation Benefits (or both), (iii) Acquirors
obligations set forth in  _Section 5.02_ (including any schedule thereto)
with respect to the employment of the Snacks Business Employees from and after
the Closing will not be affected by any Special Separation Benefits, (iv) any
such Snacks Business Employee who accepts and continues employment with
Acquiror or its Affiliates as of the Closing will be deemed to be a Continuing
Employee, (v) any Special Separation Benefits will not be taken into
consideration for purposes of determining comparability under _Section 5.03_
(including any schedule thereto), and (vi) Seller will retain all Liabilities
(including employer Tax Liabilities, but Seller will not be liable for any Tax
withholding except to the extent it is required to remit any such Tax
withheld from any such Special Separation Benefits to the appropriate
Governmental Authority) associated with the Special Separation Benefits;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will be deemed to require
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to assume any Tax Liabilities that are the
sole responsibility of any Snacks Business Employee.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent
that it can be accommodated in accordance with applicable Law, any In-Scope
Employee who is not actively at work as of the Closing Date due to a leave of
absence, disability or sick leave (in each case, reasonably expected to last
for more than two weeks following the Closing), will remain an employee of
Seller and its Affiliates and will not transfer employment to Acquiror or any
of its Affiliates (including for these purposes any Wimbledon Entity) until
such time as such employee is able to return to active work status (each, a "
_Delayed Transfer Employee_ "). Each such Delayed Transfer Employee

 



54  will not be considered a Continuing Employee unless and until such employee
returns to actively at work status with Acquiror or its Affiliates prior to
the second anniversary of the Closing or such longer period as required by
Law. With respect to each such employee, any references to the termination of
any employment-related obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates and the
assumption or commencement of employment-related obligations by Acquiror and
its Affiliates as of the Closing Date will be deemed to apply instead as of
the date such employee returns to actively at work status with Acquiror or its
Affiliates.

 

(i) With respect to any Snacks Business Employee who is working in any country
pursuant to a local visa or similar authorization as of the Closing, Acquiror
and Seller will use their commercially reasonable efforts to allow such
employee to transfer to an Affiliate of Acquiror in such country as of the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent that it can
be accommodated in accordance with applicable Law, if such transfer measures
are not completed as of the Closing, such employee shall be treated as a
Delayed Transfer Employee.

(j) Seller and Acquiror will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate to identify and effect the transfer to Acquiror of any individuals
retained as independent contractors whose employment is required to transfer
to Acquiror or a Wimbledon Entity as of the Closing pursuant to applicable
Law.

5.03  _ _Terms Of Employment__. (a) _Employment Position_. As of the
Closing, Acquiror will, or will cause one of Acquirors Affiliates to, provide
to each Continuing Employee a position with responsibilities that are
not materially diminished from the responsibilities of such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing, in each case as reasonably
determined in good faith by Acquiror.

(b) _Compensation_. (i) During the period that begins on the Closing Date and
ends on the second anniversary of the Closing (or such shorter period as such
Continuing Employee remains an employee of an Employing Entity following the
Closing) (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Acquiror will, or will cause one of
Acquirors Affiliates to, provide each Continuing Employee with (A) a base
salary or hourly wage and (B) an annual cash bonus opportunity based on
target bonus as a percentage of base salary, in each case that is at least
equal to those corresponding compensation benefits offered by Seller and its
Affiliates to such employee immediately prior to the Closing.

(ii) The Parties agree to the terms set forth on _Section 5.03(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter.

(c) _Severance_. With respect to each Continuing Employee who incurs a
Qualifying Termination (as defined on  _Section 5.03(c)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter) during the two year period that begins as of the Closing,
Acquiror will, or will cause one of Acquirors Affiliates to, provide such
employee with the severance payments and benefits set forth on _Section
5.03(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and under the applicable formulas
set forth on the attachment to _Section 5.03(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, which formulas are consistent with Sellers severance policies for

 



55  similarly-situated employees as in effect on the date of this Agreement. As
a condition to the payment of any severance due under this _Section 5.03(c)_
(including any schedule thereto) to any Continuing Employee, such Continuing
Employee must provide a general waiver and release of claims in a form
substantially similar to the form used for similarly situated Acquiror
employees (except that such release must also include a provision for a
general waiver and release of claims for the benefit of Seller and its
Affiliates) and such release must become effective. Nothing in this Agreement
will preclude such Continuing Employee who incurs a Qualifying Termination
from becoming employed by Seller or its Affiliates. Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, the timing of the payment of any severance
pursuant to this _Section 5.03(c)_ (including any schedule thereto) will be
made consistent with the terms of the applicable severance policies, but only
to the extent that Seller has provided Acquiror with information reasonably
sufficient to determine such timing.

(d) _Other Benefits_. During the Continuation Period, Acquiror will, or will
cause one of Acquirors Affiliates to, provide each Continuing Employee with
other benefits consistent with the terms set forth on _Section 5.03(d)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter.

(e) _Welfare Plans_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Acquiror will
cause each benefit plan of Acquiror and its Affiliates in which any Continuing
Employee participates that is a health or welfare benefit plan (collectively,
" _Acquiror Welfare Plans_ ") to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and service conditions with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees, other than
limitations that were in effect with respect to such Continuing Employees as
of the Closing Date under the corresponding Compensation And Benefit Plan,
(ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of such Continuing Employees
(and their eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible and
out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding Compensation And Benefit Plan
in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-
payments under a corresponding Acquiror Welfare Plan during the same plan year
in which such payments, charges and expenses were made, and (iii) with
respect to any medical plan, waive any waiting period limitation or evidence
of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Continuing
Employee following the Closing Date to the extent such employee had satisfied
any similar limitation under the corresponding Compensation And Benefit Plan.
In addition, the Parties agree to the terms set forth on _Section 5.03(e)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter.

(f) _Flexible Spending Accounts_. During the Continuation Period, Acquiror or
one of Acquirors Affiliates will cover each US Continuing Employee who has
elected to participate in a flexible spending account plan maintained by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (" _Seller s FSA_") under a flexible spending
account plan maintained by Acquiror or one of Acquirors Affiliates ("
_Acquiror s FSA_") at the same level of coverage elected under Sellers FSA.
Each US Continuing Employee will be treated as if his participation in
Acquirors FSA had been continuous from the beginning of the plan year under
Sellers FSA in which the Closing occurs and each existing salary reduction
election will be taken into account for the remainder of the plan year under
Acquirors 

 



56  FSA in which the Closing occurs, as if made under Acquirors FSA. Acquirors
FSA will provide reimbursement for medical care expenses and dependent care
expenses incurred by US Continuing Employees at any time during the plan year
under Sellers FSA in which the Closing occurs (including claims incurred
before the Closing), up to the amount of such US Continuing Employees
elections and reduced by amounts previously reimbursed by Sellers FSA.
Within 30 calendar days following the Closing Date, Seller will (i) provide to
Acquiror an accounting of the amounts elected, deducted and paid in respect of
claims under Sellers FSA in respect of the US Continuing Employees during
the plan year in which the Closing occurs and before the Closing and (ii) pay
to Acquiror the net amount, if any, of the excess of the aggregate amount
deducted over the aggregate amount paid in respect of claims under Sellers
FSA in respect of each US Continuing Employee during the plan year in which
the Closing occurs.

 

(g) _Earned Vacation_. Acquiror and Acquirors Affiliates will credit each
Continuing Employee the amount of accrued and unpaid hours of vacation,
personal hours or days earned and sick leave (together, the " _Transferred
Leave_ ") applicable to such Continuing Employee as of the Closing and on the
Closing Date Seller will provide to Acquiror as of the Closing Date a
schedule indicating for each Continuing Employee the type and number of days
of Transferred Leave. Subject to Seller providing to Acquiror copies of the
applicable policies, Acquiror and Acquirors Affiliates will ensure that (i)
such Transferred Leave is not subject to forfeiture, to the same extent not
subject to forfeiture under the policies of Seller and its Affiliates
governing such Transferred Leave prior to the Closing and that (ii) such
Transferred Leave does not count toward any maximum accrual amount under any
plan, program or policy maintained by Acquiror or one of Acquirors Affiliates
for the purpose of providing vacation, personal days or hours or sick leave,
to the same extent it did not count under applicable policies of Seller and
its Affiliates. __

(h) _Expatriate And Localized Employees_. With respect to Snacks Business
Employees who, as of the Closing, receive specific expatriate payments or
benefits from Seller or its Affiliates (an " _Expatriate Package_ ," and each
such employee who is a Continuing Employee, an " _Expatriate Employee_ "),
Acquiror will maintain a comparable Expatriate Package for each such
Expatriate Employee until such Expatriate Employee returns to his or her home
country (excluding any temporary return) and Acquiror will pay the costs of
such repatriation to the same extent and on the same terms as provided for in
Sellers or its Affiliates policies and practices, as applicable, immediately
prior to the Closing. With respect to Snacks Business Employees who, prior to
the Closing, have been localized other than in their original home country and
receive specific benefits from Seller or its Affiliates relating to their
localized status (a " _Localization Package_ ," and each such employee who is
a Continuing Employee, a " _Localized Employee_ "), Acquiror will maintain a
comparable Localization Package for each such Localized Employee until his or
her employment terminates.

 

(i) _International Retirement Arrangements_. Except as set forth on _Section
5.03(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, effective as of the Closing Date
each international retirement arrangement (a " _Global IRA_ ") for any
Continuing Employee will

 



57  be terminated and Seller will be obligated to make a cash payment to each
such Continuing Employee in an amount determined in accordance with the terms
of the applicable Global IRA and will take all other actions that may be
necessary in connection with such termination and Acquiror will not assume any
Liabilities in respect of such Global IRAs.

(j) _Post-Continuation Period Benefits_. Following the Continuation Period,
Acquiror will, or will cause one of Acquirors Affiliates to, provide to each
Continuing Employee then continuing in employment with Acquiror or its
Affiliates employment on terms no less favorable in the aggregate than the
terms of employment of similarly situated employees of Acquiror and its
Affiliates.

 

(k) _Special Rules For Non-US Employees_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any Snacks Business Employee who is
employed by a member of the Seller Group in a non-US jurisdiction immediately
prior to the Closing, and who is required by applicable Law to transfer to a
member of the Acquiror Group in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, will transfer
automatically on the Closing Date to a member of the Acquiror Group in
accordance with such applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the following terms will apply to all Non-US Continuing Employees:

(i) To the extent that (A) the applicable Law of any jurisdiction, (B)
any applicable collective bargaining agreement or other applicable agreement
with a works council or economic committee, or (C) any applicable employment
agreement, would require Acquiror or its Affiliates (including the Wimbledon
Entities) to provide any more favorable terms of employment to any Non-US
Continuing Employee than those otherwise provided for by this _Section 5.03_
(including any schedule thereto) (or extend the period of time for which such
standards are met), in connection with the sale of the Snacks Business to
Acquiror, then Acquiror will, or will cause one of Acquirors Affiliates to
provide such Non-US Continuing Employee with such more favorable term, and
otherwise provide terms of employment in accordance with this _Section 5.03_
(including any schedule thereto).

(ii) Acquiror and Seller agree that to the extent provided under the
applicable Laws of certain foreign jurisdictions, (A) any employment
agreements between Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Non-US
Continuing Employee, on the other hand, and (B) any collective bargaining
agreements applicable to the Non-US Continuing Employees in such
jurisdictions, will in each case have effect after the Closing as if
originally made between Acquiror and the other parties to such employment
agreement or collective bargaining agreement; _provided_ that for the
avoidance of doubt, Seller and its Affiliates will retain all Liabilities
under such collective bargaining agreements and such employment agreements (x)
in respect of the period prior to the Closing Date and (y) with respect to
the payment of any retention arrangement entered into prior to the Closing
Date by Seller or one of its Affiliates (even if payable after the Closing
Date).

 



58 5.04 __Bonuses And Incentives__. Seller will retain all obligations to
the Snacks Business Employees, including Continuing Employees, with respect
to the bonuses and incentives under Sellers Short Term Achievement Reward
(STAR) bonus program, Long-Term Incentive (LTI) program, Key Manager Stock
Option Program and any other cash, annual, long-term, equity or similar
incentive program in which the Continuing Employees participate for the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs that are attributable to the period
prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Acquiror is responsible for all Liabilities in respect of all Continuing
Employee compensation attributable to periods following the Closing, which
compensation will be provided under plans and programs of Acquiror and
its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller will retain any
Liabilities with respect to any retention arrangements entered into with any
Continuing Employee prior to the Closing even if the arrangement relates to
service following the Closing.

5.05 __Credit For Service With Seller__. Where applicable, Acquiror and
Acquirors Affiliates will provide credit for each Continuing Employees
length of service with Seller and its Affiliates for all purposes (including
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual) under each plan, program, policy or
arrangement of Acquiror and Acquirors Affiliates to the same extent such
service was recognized under a similar plan, program, policy or arrangement of
Seller or any of its Affiliates, except that such prior service credit will
not be required to the extent that it results in a duplication of benefits
and such prior service credit shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan.

5.06 __COBRA And HIPAA; Workers  Compensation__. Subject to _Section
5.08(d)_, effective as of the Closing, Acquiror and Acquirors Affiliates will
assume and be responsible for (a) all Liabilities with respect to US
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, in respect of health
insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
Sections 601, et seq. and Sections 701, et seq. of ERISA, Section 4980B and
Sections 9801, et seq. of the Code and applicable state or similar Laws (other
than with respect to an eligible Continuing Employee who elects coverage
under a retiree medical plan of Seller or its Affiliates) and (b) to the
extent applicable, all workers compensation benefits payable to or on behalf
of the US Continuing Employees.

 

5.07 __WARN Act__. Acquiror will, and will cause Acquirors Affiliates to,
provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or any other similar Law (the " _WARN Act_ ") and otherwise
comply with the WARN Act with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
(as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting
Continuing Employees (including as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements) and
occurring during the 90-day period from and after the Closing. Acquiror will
not, and will not permit any of Acquirors Affiliates to, take any action on
or after the Closing Date that would cause any termination of employment by
Seller or Sellers Affiliates of any employees of the Snacks Business or any
Wimbledon Entity occurring prior to the Closing to constitute a "plant
closing," "mass layoff" or group

 



59  termination or similar event under the WARN Act, or to create any Liability
or penalty to Seller or any of its Affiliates for any employment terminations
under applicable Law. Seller will notify Acquiror of any layoffs of any
employees of the Snacks Business or any Wimbledon Entity that occur during the
90-day period prior to the Closing.

5.08 __Miscellaneous__. (a) Following the date of this Agreement, Seller and
Acquiror (and their Affiliates) will reasonably cooperate and use good faith
efforts in all matters reasonably necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Article V_ (including any schedule thereto), including,
(i) cooperating and providing each other with all necessary and reasonable
assistance and information to ensure that any works councils or committees,
trade unions and/or employee representatives applicable to the Non-US
Continuing Employees are provided with the information required in order for
proper consultation to take place, (ii) exchanging information and data,
including (A) reports prepared in connection with bonus plan participation and
related data of Continuing Employees and all other information reasonably
necessary for Acquiror to comply with Acquirors covenants contained in this
_Article V_ (including any schedule thereto) other than the information
related to performance ratings or assessment of In-Scope Employees (including
performance history reports), and (B) information relating to workers
compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverages (in each
case, except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law or to the extent that
such information and data relates to performance ratings or assessments
or employees of Seller and its Affiliates), (iii) making any and all required
filings and notices, (iv) making any and all required communications with In-
Scope Employees and (v) obtaining any Governmental Approvals required
hereunder. 

(b) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, any communications between
Acquiror and any employees of Seller and its Affiliates regarding terms of
employment, employee benefits or otherwise regarding employment with Acquiror
will be conducted at the times and through processes approved by Seller, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Such processes will provide
adequate access to the In-Scope Employees and allow all reasonable means of
communication with such employees by Acquiror and its Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any communications with In-Scope Employees or any
other employees of Seller or its Affiliates will be limited to business
operations and employee benefit matters relating to In-Scope Employees, future
organization design and staffing; _provided_ , _further_ , that Acquiror will
coordinate any such communications with the individuals included on the list
(by name and/or title) of the Snacks Business management team to be provided
by Seller to Acquiror as promptly as practicable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller may update such list from time to time in order to maintain the
accuracy of such list, including as a result of terminations, transfers, new
hires and accidental or inadvertent errors or omissions.

 

(c) Without limiting Acquirors obligations under this _Article V_ (including
any schedule thereto) with respect to the Continuing Employees, this _Article
V_ (including any schedule thereto) will not (i) be treated as an amendment
of, or undertaking to amend any employee benefit plan in which Acquirors
employees participate or (ii)

 



60  prohibit Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including the Wimbledon
Entities) from amending any employee benefit plan in which Acquirors
employees participate.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller will retain and be responsible for (i) all Liabilities to the extent
relating to claims for benefits or recovery with respect to claims incurred on
or prior to the Closing Date by any Continuing Employee under any employee
benefit plan or third-party insurance arrangement, to the extent such benefit
plan or third-party insurance arrangement provides for claims payment or
recovery on an as incurred basis (including, without limitation, claims under
medical, life insurance and disability benefit plans and policies, workers
compensation claims and similar claims), (ii) any Controlled Group Liability,
and (iii) all Liabilities relating to the employment or termination of
employment by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any of their employees
(including any In-Scope Employee).

(e) In no event will Acquiror be deemed to have breached its obligations under
this _Article V_ (including any schedule thereto) if the failure to meet such
obligations results from Sellers failure to provide information reasonably
necessary to satisfy Acquirors obligations under this _Article V_ (including
any schedule thereto). 

(f) Seller and Acquiror agree to the terms set forth on _Section 5.08(f)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter. 

5.09 __Wimbledon Entity Plans__ _._ For each Compensation And Benefit Plan
that is sponsored, maintained or entered into by a Wimbledon Entity, other
than as contemplated by _Section 5.03(k)(ii)_, prior to the Closing Date,
Seller will transfer such plan and all Liabilities and obligations with
respect to such plan to a Seller Affiliate other than a Wimbledon Entity;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 5.09_ shall not apply to
Liabilities in respect of Continuing Employees under the Snacks Business
Pension Plans as contemplated by  _Section 1.05(a)(xv)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter.

5.10 __Reservation of Rights__. Nothing in this Agreement will restrict the
ability of Acquiror and its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employee for any reason at any time after the effective date of his
or her employment with Acquiror and its Affiliates, subject to Acquirors
obligations under _Section 5.03(c)_ (including any schedule thereto)
regarding severance. Moreover, nothing contained in this Agreement will
require Acquiror and its Affiliates to maintain any specific compensation
or employee benefit plan, program, policy or practice following the Closing
Date.

transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing
Date:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Acquiror;

(b) by either Seller or Acquiror:

(i) if the Closing does not occur on or prior to December 31, 2012 (the "
_End Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date is due
to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe in all material respects the covenants of such Party set forth
herein; or

(ii) if (A) there is any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
hereunder illegal or otherwise prohibited (other than those having only an
immaterial effect and that do not impose criminal liability or penalties) or

order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which the terminating
Party must have complied with its obligations hereunder to resist, resolve or
lift) permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any material

ruling or other action becomes final and non-appealable;

 



63 (c) by Seller:

(i) if Acquiror breaches any of its representations and warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Article VI_ and (B) cannot be or has not
been cured within 60 days after the giving of written notice to Acquiror of
such breach; or

(ii) if any of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.01_ or _6.03_ becomes
incapable of fulfillment, and have not been waived by Seller to the extent
waivable;

 

(d) by Acquiror:

(i) if Seller breaches any of its representations and warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in _Article VI_ and (B) cannot be or has not been

7.02 __Notice Of Termination; Return Of Documents; Continuing Confidentiality
Obligation__. In the event of termination by Seller or Acquiror pursuant to
this _Article VII_ , written notice thereof will forthwith be given to the

transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this _Article
VII_, this Agreement will become void and of no further force and effect,

terminate with the other provisions of this Agreement except as 

 



64  specifically provided in this Section) containing general provisions.
Nothing in this _Article VII_ will be deemed to release any Party from any
Liability for any breach by such Party of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement or to impair the right of any Party to compel specific performance
by another Party of its obligations under this Agreement that specifically
survive such termination as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.

VIII. INDEMNIFICATION

8.01 __Indemnification By Acquiror__. Without limiting or otherwise affecting
the indemnity provisions of any Ancillary Agreement, from and after the
Closing Date, the Acquiror will indemnify, defend (or, where applicable, pay
the defense costs for) and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and
against, and will reimburse such Seller Indemnitees with respect to, any and
all Losses that result from, relate to or arise, whether prior to or
following the Closing, out of any of the following items (without
duplication):

(a) the Wimbledon Liabilities including the failure of any Wimbledon Entity
or any other Person to pay, perform, fulfill, discharge and, to the extent
applicable, comply with, in due course and in full, any such Wimbledon
Liabilities;

 

(b) any breach by Acquiror of any covenant to be performed by such Persons
pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements at or after the
Closing; and

(c) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties
contained in _Article III_ of this Agreement.

8.02 __Indemnification By Seller__. Without limiting or otherwise affecting
the indemnity provisions of any Ancillary Agreement, from and after the
Closing Date, Seller will indemnify, defend (or, where applicable, pay the
defense costs for) and hold harmless the Acquiror Indemnitees from and
against, and will reimburse such Acquiror Indemnitee with respect to, any and
all Losses that result from, relate to or arise, whether prior to or following
the Closing, out of any of the following items (without duplication):

 

(a) any Excluded Liability, including the failure of Seller or any other
member of the Seller Group or any other Person to pay, perform, fulfill,
discharge and, to the extent applicable, comply with, in due course and in
full such Liabilities;

(b) any breach by Seller or any other member of the Seller Group of any
covenant to be performed by such Persons pursuant to this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements at or after the Closing;

(c) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties of
Seller contained in _Article II_ of this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered by Seller at the Closing; and 

 



65 (d) any claim made by or in respect of any person employed or formerly
employed by Seller or any member of the Seller Group, other than a Continuing
Employee, that the employment of such person was required to transfer to the
Acquiror Group by the operation of this Agreement or by operation of Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will be deemed to require Seller
to indemnify any Acquiror Indemnitee for any claims made by or in respect of
such person, relating to his or her continued employment with the Acquiror
Group after the Closing Date.

 

8.03 __Calculation Of Indemnity Payments__. (a) _Insurance_. The amount of
any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this _Article VIII_ will
be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates
under third-party, non-captive insurance policies with respect to such Loss
(less the cost to collect the proceeds of such insurance and the amount, if
any, of any retroactive or other premium adjustments reasonably attributable
thereto). If any Loss resulting in indemnification under

_Section 8.01(c)_ or _8.02(c)_ related to a claim by an Indemnitee or its
Affiliates is covered by one or more third-party, non-captive insurance
policies held by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates, the Indemnitee will use
and will cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
claims against the applicable insurers for coverage of such Loss under such
policies. If the Indemnitee or its Affiliates actually receive a full or
partial recovery under such insurance policies following payment of
indemnification by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, then the
Indemnitee will refund amounts received from the Indemnifying Party up to the
amount of indemnification actually received from the Indemnifying Party with
respect to such Loss.

(b) _Taxes_. The amount that any Indemnifying Party is or may be required to
provide indemnification to or on behalf of any Indemnitee under this Agreement
will be (i) decreased to take into account any Tax benefit actually realized
by the Indemnitee (or an Affiliate thereof) arising from the incurrence or
payment of the relevant indemnified item, and (ii) increased to take into
account any additional Tax cost incurred by the Indemnitee (or an Affiliate
thereof) arising from the receipt of any indemnification payments hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, as the case
may be, will be taken into account solely to the extent actually realized in
the taxable period during which an Indemnifying Party accrues an
indemnification payment or the Indemnitee incurs the relevant indemnified
item. Any indemnity payment hereunder will initially be made without regard to
this _Section 8.03_ and will be reduced or increased, as the case may be, to
reflect any applicable Tax benefit or Tax cost, respectively, within 30 days
after the Indemnitee (or an Affiliate thereof) actually realizes such Tax
benefit or incurs such Tax cost, respectively.

 

8.04 __Procedures For Defense, Settlement And Indemnification Of Third-Party
Claims__. (a) _Direct Claims_. All claims made hereunder by (i) any member
of the Seller Group, on the one hand, against Acquiror or any member of the
Acquiror Group, on the other hand, or (ii) by Acquiror or any member of the
Acquiror Group, on the one hand, against any member of the Seller Group, on
the other hand (collectively, " _Direct Claims_ "), will be subject to the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section 10.15_.

 



66 (b) _Third-Party Claims_. (i) _Notice Of Claims_. If an Indemnitee
receives notice or otherwise learns of the assertion by a Person (including
any Governmental Authority) who is not a member of the Seller Group or
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Wimbledon
Entities) of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any
Action with respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide
indemnification (collectively, a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnitee
will give such Indemnifying Party prompt written notice (a " _Claims Notice_
") thereof but in any event within 15 days after becoming aware of such Third-
Party Claim. Any such notice will describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable
detail, stating the nature, basis for indemnification and the amount thereof,
to the extent known, along with copies of any relevant documents evidencing
such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delay or failure of
any Indemnitee or other Person to give notice as provided in this _Section
8.04(b)(i)_ will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under
this _Article VIII_ , except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced by such delay or failure to give notice.

(ii) _Opportunity To Defend_. The Indemnifying Party has the right,
exercisable by written notice to the Indemnitee within 60 days after receipt
of a Claims Notice from the Indemnitee of the commencement or assertion of any
Third-Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this
_Article VIII_ , to assume and conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim
in accordance with the limits set forth in this Agreement with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Third-Party Claim does not
relate to or arise in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (B) the Third-Party Claim solely
seeks (and continues to seek) monetary damages and/or equitable or corrective
relief (with or without monetary damages, fines or penalties) which equitable
relief would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the operations of
(1) Seller or its Affiliates, if Acquiror is the Indemnifying Party or (2)
Acquiror or its Affiliates (including after the Closing, any Wimbledon
Entities), if Seller is the Indemnifying Party; and (C) the Indemnifying Party
expressly agrees with the Indemnitee in writing to be fully responsible for
all of the Losses that arise from the Third-Party Claim (the conditions set
forth in clauses (A) through (C) are, collectively, the " _Litigation
Conditions_ "). For purposes of clause (C) of the preceding sentence, if a
Third-Party Claim consists of multiple claims by a plaintiff or group of
plaintiffs, and it is reasonably practicable for an Indemnifying Party to
control the defense of a subset of such claims, the Indemnifying Party may
elect to agree to be fully responsible for only all of the Losses that arise
from such subset of claims, and may elect to control the defense of only such
subset of claims, _provided_ that the other Litigation Conditions set forth in
clauses (A), (B) and (C) of the preceding sentence are satisfied. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim in
accordance with this _Section 8.04(b)_, the Indemnitee may continue to defend
the Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a
Third-Party Claim as provided in this _Section 8.04(b)_, the Indemnifying
Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if (x) any of the Litigation Conditions ceases
to be met or (y) the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps
necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim or (z) in the
reasonable judgment

 



67  of the Indemnitee based on the advice of counsel, there exists an actual or
potential conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee may assume
its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable
costs or expenses thereafter incurred in connection with such defense. The
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnitee, as the case may be, has the right to
participate in (but, subject to the prior sentence, not control), at its own
expense, the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the other is defending as
provided in this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the
defense of any Third-Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, may not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, consent to a settlement
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim
unless such settlement or judgment includes as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a complete
release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim and unless
such settlement or judgment does not impose injunctive or other non-monetary
equitable relief against the Indemnitee or its Affiliates, or their respective
businesses. The Indemnitee has the right to settle any Third-Party Claim, the
defense of which has not been assumed by the Indemnifying Party, with the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) Without limiting any provision of this _Section 8.04_, each of the
Parties will reasonably cooperate, and will cause each of its respective
Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, with each other in the defense of any
claim that the Snacks Business infringes Intellectual Property of any third
Person, and no Party will knowingly acknowledge, or permit any member of its
respective Group to acknowledge, the validity or infringing use of any
Intellectual Property of a third Person in a manner as to which such Party
has actual knowledge that so doing will be materially inconsistent with the
defense of such infringement, validity or similar claim or challenge except as
required by Law. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein will preclude
truthful testimony by Seller or any of its representatives or employees, and
such truthful testimony will not be deemed a breach hereof.

(d) In the event Acquiror promptly notifies Seller in writing that Seller or
one of its Affiliates has challenged the validity of any Intellectual Property
of the Snacks Business, Seller will withdraw or cause such challenge to be
withdrawn within five Business Days following receipt of such written notice
from Acquiror.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 8.04_ will not apply to any
claim related to Tax matters, which will be governed exclusively by _Article
IX_.

8.05 __Additional Matters__. (a) _Cooperation In Defense And Settlement_.
With respect to any Third-Party Claim for which Acquiror, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, may have Liability under this Agreement or any of
the Ancillary Agreements, the Parties agree to cooperate fully and maintain a
joint defense (in a manner that will preserve the attorney-client privilege,
joint defense or other privilege with respect thereto) so as to minimize such
Liabilities and defense costs associated therewith. The Party that is not
responsible for managing the defense of such Third-Party Claims will, upon
reasonable request, be consulted with respect to significant matters relating

 



68  thereto and may retain counsel to monitor or assist in the defense of such
claims at its own cost.

(b) _Certain Actions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
_Section 8.05_, Seller may elect to have exclusive authority and control over
the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of any and all Actions
pending at the Closing which relate to or arise out of the Snacks Business,
the Wimbledon Assets or the Wimbledon Liabilities and as to which a member of
the Seller Group is also a plaintiff or named as a target or defendant
thereunder (but excluding any such Actions which solely relate to or solely
arise in connection with the Snacks Business, the Wimbledon Assets or the
Wimbledon Liabilities); _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) Seller will defend
or prosecute, as applicable, such Actions in good faith, (ii) Seller will
reasonably consult with Acquiror on a regular basis with respect to strategy
and developments with respect to any such Action, (iii) Acquiror will
have the right to participate in (but not control) the defense or
prosecution, as applicable, of such Action, and (iv) Seller must obtain the
written consent of Acquiror, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, to settle or compromise or consent to the entry of
judgment with respect to such Action if such settlement, consent or judgment
would require Acquiror to abandon its rights, change its business practices or
incur any Liabilities with respect thereto or where a plaintiff, a judgment
that is less than was being sought in respect of the Snacks Business. After
any such compromise, settlement, consent to entry of judgment or entry of
judgment, Seller and Acquiror will agree upon a reasonable allocation to
Acquiror and Acquiror will be responsible for or receive, as the case may be,
Acquirors proportionate share of any such compromise, settlement, consent or
judgment attributable to the Snacks Business, the Wimbledon Assets or the
Wimbledon Liabilities, including its proportionate share of the reasonable
costs and expenses associated with defending same.

(c)  _Substitution_. In the event of an Action that involves solely matters
that are indemnifiable and in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named
defendant, if either the Indemnitee or the Indemnifying Party so requests, the
Parties will endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named
defendant. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason
or is not requested, the rights and obligations of the Parties regarding
indemnification and the management of the defense of claims as set forth in
this _Article VIII_ will not be affected.

(d) _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of any Indemnitee in connection with any
Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will
stand in the place of such Indemnitee, in whole or in part based upon whether
the Indemnifying Party has paid all or only part of the Indemnitees
Liability, as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such
Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party
Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or
against any other Person. Such Indemnitee will cooperate with such
Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such
Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.

 



69 8.06 __Exclusive Remedy__.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of a Party with
respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement, the Snacks
Business, the Wimbledon Assets, the Wimbledon Liabilities, the Wimbledon
Entities or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than claims
of, or causes of action arising from, knowing and intentional fraud and except
for seeking specific performance or other equitable relief to require a Party
to perform its obligations under this Agreement to the extent permitted
hereunder and thereunder and except as otherwise provided herein or in any
Ancillary Agreement) will be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article VIII_ or, in the case of indemnification for Taxes,
_Article IX_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, from
and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
VIII_ and _Article IX_ and other than claims of, or causes of action arising
from, actual fraud and except for seeking specific performance or other
equitable relief to require a Party to perform its obligations under this
Agreement to the extent permitted hereunder and except as otherwise provided
in any Ancillary Agreement) that such Party or its Affiliates may have
against the other Party or any of its Affiliates, or their respective
directors, officers and employees, arising under or based upon any applicable
Laws and arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the representations and
warranties in Section 2.17 and the covenants in Section 4.22 are the Seller
Groups exclusive obligations in respect of the Termination Agreement and
matters contemplated thereby and no member of the Seller Group will have any
Liability in respect thereof except for breaches thereof or inaccuracies
therein.

8.07 __Limitations on Indemnification__. (a) Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, (a) Seller will not have any liability under
_Section 8.02(c)_ (other than with respect to a breach of any of the Seller
Specified Representations) unless the aggregate liability for Losses suffered
by the Acquiror Indemnitees thereunder exceeds $25,000,000 (the "
_Deductible_ ") and then only to the extent of such excess; (b) Sellers
aggregate liability under _Section 8.02(c)_ (other than with respect to a
breach of  _Sections 2.01_ (Organization), _2.02_ (Authority), _2.11_
(Brokers), _2.12_ (Title), _2.13(a)-(c)_ (Wimbledon Assets), _2.17_ (Diamond
Transaction), and _2.16_ (Wimbledon Entities) (the " _Seller Specified
Representations_ ")) will not exceed 15% of the Final Purchase Price (the "
_Cap_ "); (c) (i) Acquiror will not have any liability under _Section
8.01(c)_ (other than with respect to a breach of any of the Acquiror
Specified Representations) unless the aggregate liability for Losses suffered
by the Seller Indemnitees thereunder exceeds the Deductible, and then only to
the extent of such excess, and (ii) Acquirors aggregate liability under
_Section 8.01(c)_ (other than with respect to a breach of _Section 3.02_
(Authorization) (the " _Acquiror Specified Representations_ ")) will not
exceed the Cap; (d) no party will have any liability under  _Section
8.01(c)_ or _8.02(c)_ for any Loss arising out of any individual claim (or any
series of claims arising out of substantially the same events, facts or
circumstances, which will be aggregated for purposes of this clause
(d)), unless such Loss exceeds $25,000,

 



70  and any Losses that are disregarded pursuant to this clause (d) will not be
aggregated for purposes of the preceding clauses (a) through (c); (e) neither
Seller nor Acquiror will have any liability under _Section 8.02(c)_ or
_Section 8.01(c)_, for any otherwise indemnifiable Loss to the extent such
Losses are reflected on the Final Closing Adjustment Statement. Costs of
defense will not be subject to any of the limitations contemplated in this
_Section 8.07_ or be included in any calculation of whether any cap or
similar metric was met. This _Section 8.07_ will not apply to indemnification
for Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by _Article IX_.

(b) For purposes of _Sections 8.01(c)_ and _8.02(c)_ , any qualification in
any such representation or warranty as to materiality or Snacks Business MAE
will be taken into account for purposes of determining whether such
representation or warranty has been breached, but in the event that such
representation or warranty has been determined to have been breached, such
qualification as to materiality or Snacks Business MAE will thereafter be
disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of Losses arising from such
breach and Acquiror or Seller, as the case may be, may recover the entire
amount of such Losses subject only to the Deductible and the Cap.

8.08 __Tax Treatment Of Indemnification__. For all Tax purposes, Acquiror and
Seller agree to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the purchase price unless, and then solely to the extent that, a
Final Determination provides otherwise.

IX. TAX MATTERS

9.01 __Preparation And Filing Of Tax Returns__. (a) Seller will prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns in
respect of the Wimbledon Entities (or any consolidated, combined, unitary or
affiliated group of which any Wimbledon Entity is a member), the other
Wimbledon Assets and the Snacks Business that (i) are required to be filed
(taking into account any applicable extensions) on or before the Closing
Date, or (ii) are required to be filed (taking into account any applicable
extensions) after the Closing Date and (A) are Consolidated Tax Returns, or
(B) are required to be filed on a separate Tax Return basis for any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date. Acquiror will timely file, or
cause to be timely filed, any Tax Return that is prepared by Seller with
respect to a Wimbledon Entity pursuant to clause (ii)(B) of the
immediately preceding sentence and delivered to Acquiror at least ten days
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account any
applicable extensions); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Acquiror nor any
Wimbledon Entity will be required to sign or file any Tax Return not prepared
in accordance with (i) the past practices of the relevant Wimbledon Entity or
the Seller Group (as applicable) or (ii) applicable Law. Acquiror will prepare
and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns
required to be filed in respect of the Wimbledon Entities, the other Wimbledon
Assets or the Snacks Business for a Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller will prepare any such Tax Return for Wimble Manufacturing Belgium
BVBA, Wimble Services Belgium BVBA and Pringles International Operations SARL.
Any Tax Return required to be filed in respect of a Straddle Period will be
prepared on a basis consistent with (i) except to the extent otherwise
required by

 



71  applicable Law or to the extent relating to a Restructuring Transaction, the
past practices of the Wimbledon Entity or the Seller Group (as applicable) and
(ii) applicable Law. The Preparing Party will deliver to the Reviewing Party,
at least 15 days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return
(taking into account any applicable extensions), a statement setting forth the
amount of Tax for which the Reviewing Party is responsible pursuant to
_Sections 9.04(a)_ , _9.04(b)_ and _9.04(c)_ and a copy of such Tax Return,
together with any additional information relating thereto that the Reviewing
Party may reasonably request. The Reviewing Party will have the right to
review such Straddle Period Tax Return, statement and additional information,
if any, prior to the filing of such Tax Return, and the Preparing Party will
reflect on such Tax Return any reasonable comments submitted by the Reviewing
Party at least five days prior to the due date of such Tax Return; _provided_
, _however_ , that Seller will control all determinations relating to the
reporting of any Restructuring Transaction on any Straddle Period Tax Return
of a Wimbledon Entity required to be prepared by Seller pursuant to this
_Section 9.04(a)_. Any Tax Return relating to a Wimbledon Entity, the other
Wimbledon Assets or the Snacks Business for a Straddle Period will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, be filed on the basis that the relevant
Tax period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. Neither
Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates (including any Wimbledon Entity) will file
an amended Tax Return, or agree to any waiver or extension of the statute of
limitations relating to Taxes with respect to, any Wimbledon Entity, the other
Wimbledon Assets or the Snacks Business for a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date or a Straddle Period, in each case, without the prior
written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(b) Seller will pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due with respect to Tax
Returns which Seller is obligated to prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)_, and, at least five days prior to
the due date for a Tax Return in respect of a Straddle Period, Seller will
pay its portion of the Taxes due with respect to such Tax Return to Acquiror,
as determined pursuant to _Section 9.04(c)_. Acquiror will pay or cause to be
paid all other Taxes required to be paid by or with respect to any Wimbledon
Entity, Wimbledon Assets or the Snacks Business.

9.02  _ _Carryforwards And Carrybacks__. Acquiror will cause the Wimbledon
Entities, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to carry forward any Tax
asset, arising in any Post-Closing Tax Period that could, whether in the
absence of an election or otherwise, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Acquiror will make, and cause its Affiliates (including the Wimbledon
Entities) to make all available elections to effect the foregoing. To the
extent a Tax asset arising in any Post-Closing Tax Period is required to be
carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period under applicable Law, Acquiror will
be entitled to any refund or Refund Equivalent resulting from such carryback,
and to the extent any such refund or Refund Equivalent is received or
realized by Seller or any member of the Seller Group, Seller will pay to
Acquiror the amount of such refund or Refund Equivalent (including interest
received from any Taxing Authority with respect to such refund or
Refund Equivalent) within 10 days of receipt (or realization) thereof.

 



72 9.03 __Refunds__. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.02_, Seller
will be entitled to any refund or Refund Equivalent received or realized with
respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to any Wimbledon Entity, the other
Wimbledon Assets or the Snacks Business for any Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such amounts
arising by reason of amended Tax Returns or any formal or informal claim for a
refund of Taxes filed after the Closing Date in accordance with the provisions
of this  _Section 9.03_), and to the extent any such refund or Refund
Equivalent is received or realized by Acquiror or any member of the Acquiror
Group (including the Wimbledon Entities), Acquiror will pay to Seller the
amount of such refund or Refund Equivalent (including interest received from
any Taxing Authority with respect to such refund or Refund Equivalent) within
10 days of receipt (or realization) thereof. In connection with the foregoing,
if Seller determines that any of the Wimbledon Entities is entitled to file
or make a formal or informal claim for a refund of Taxes (including by filing
an amended Tax Return) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller will
be entitled to file or make, or to request that Acquiror cause the applicable
Wimbledon Entity to file or make, such formal or informal claim for refund,
and Seller will be entitled to control the prosecution of such claim for
refund; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller will not be entitled to file or
make and Acquiror will not be required to file or make, or cause any Wimbledon
Entity to file or make, any such claim for refund if Acquiror reasonably
determines that such action would adversely affect Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates (including any Wimbledon Entity). Acquiror will cooperate, and
cause the Wimbledon Entities to cooperate, with respect to such claim for
refund. Acquiror and the Wimbledon Entities will be entitled to any refund or
Refund Equivalent received or realized with respect to Taxes imposed on or
with respect to any Wimbledon Entity, the other Wimbledon Assets or the Snacks
Business for a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date. Acquiror and
Seller will equitably apportion any refund or Refund Equivalent (including
interest received from any Taxing Authority with respect to such refund or
Refund Equivalent) received or realized with respect to Taxes imposed on or
with respect to any Wimbledon Entity, the other Wimbledon Assets or the
Snacks Business for a Straddle Period in a manner consistent with the
principles set forth in _Section 9.04(c)_.

9.04 __Tax Indemnification__. (a) Seller will indemnify, defend and hold
Acquiror and its Affiliates harmless from and against all Excluded Taxes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be required to indemnify
Acquiror for any Excluded Taxes resulting from or arising in connection with
any breach by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Wimbledon Entities) of any covenant in this Agreement. Subject to
_Section 9.08(f)_, Sellers obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including the Wimbledon Entities) from any
Excluded Taxes pursuant to this  _Section 9.04(a)_ will terminate effective
60 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including extensions).

(b) Acquiror will indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates
harmless from and against all (i) Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
Wimbledon Entities, the other Wimbledon Assets or the Snacks Business for any
Post-Closing Tax Period, other than any Taxes that Seller must indemnify
Acquiror and its Affiliates for under _Section 9.04(a)_, (ii) Transfer Taxes
for which Acquiror is responsible pursuant to 

 



73   _Section 9.07_, (iii) Taxes resulting from or arising in connection with
any breach by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Wimbledon Entities) of any covenant in this Agreement, and (iv) costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to any
item in clauses (i) through (iii). Subject to _Section 9.08(f)_, Acquirors
obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Seller or any of its
Affiliates from Taxes pursuant to this _Section 9.04(b)_ will terminate
effective 60 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including extensions). 

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period:

(i) Property Taxes and similar periodic Taxes imposed on or with respect to
the Wimbledon Entities, the other Wimbledon Assets and the Snacks Business
that are not based on income or receipts ( _e.g._ , annual franchise Taxes
imposed based on authorized shares) allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
will be computed based upon the ratio of (A) the number of days in the portion
of such Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date to (B) the total number
of days in such Straddle Period; and

(ii) Taxes of the Wimbledon Entities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, other
than Taxes described in _Section 9.04(c)(i)_, will be computed as if such Tax
period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date and, in the case
of any Taxes of the Wimbledon Entities attributable to the ownership of any
equity interest in any partnership or other "flowthrough" entity, as if the
Tax period of such partnership or other "flowthrough" entity ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date;  _provided_ that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be
allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the portion of the Straddle Period ending after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each such period.

(d) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this  _Section
9.04_ will be made within 30 days after the Indemnitee makes written demand
upon the Indemnifying Party, but in no case earlier than five Business Days
prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be paid to
the applicable Taxing Authority.

(e) If a claim or other Tax Proceeding is made or initiated by any Taxing
Authority (a " _Tax Claim_ ") which, if successful, could result in an
indemnity payment pursuant to _Section 9.04_, the Party receiving notice of
such Tax Claim will promptly notify the other Party in writing of such claim
(and provide copies of any documents received from the Taxing Authority in
respect of such claim) no later than ten Business Days after such Tax Claim is
made; _provided_ that failure to provide such notice will not relieve such
other Party of its indemnification obligations except to the extent that such
other Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. With respect to any Tax
Claim relating to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or
otherwise relating to, or affecting, a Consolidated Tax Return, Seller will
control, at its own expense, all proceedings and may make all decisions taken
in connection with such Tax

 



74  Claim (including selection of counsel), and, without limiting the foregoing,
may, in its sole discretion, pursue or forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing Authority with
respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the applicable
Liability for Taxes and sue for a refund or contest the Tax Claim; _provided_
, _however_ that with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a separate Tax
Return that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Acquiror
or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Wimbledon
Entities) that is material, Seller will not settle any such Tax Claim without
the prior written consent of Acquiror, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(f) The Preparing Party will control all Tax Claims with respect to Straddle
Period Tax Returns of the Wimbledon Entities required to be prepared by such
Preparing Party pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such Preparing Party will not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Claim
without the prior written consent of the Reviewing Party, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of
doubt, Acquiror will control all Tax Claims with respect to Taxes of or with
respect to a Wimbledon Entity, the other Wimbledon Assets or the
Snack Business for any Tax Period beginning after the Closing Date.

9.05 __Internal Restructurings__. The Parties intend and agree that the
material transactions contemplated hereunder shall be structured as set forth
on _Section 9.05_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Upon a Partys written
request, the other Party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) reasonably
cooperate with the requesting Party and use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate possible alternative or supplemental structures (including any
restructuring of the Seller Group prior to the Closing) for the transactions
contemplated hereunder (an " _Alternative Transaction Structure_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the non-requesting party will not be required to
facilitate or consent to an Alternative Transaction Structure (and will
otherwise have no obligations pursuant to this _Section 9.05_ with respect to
an Alternative Transaction Structure) if the adoption of such Alternative
Transaction Structure could adversely affect such non-requesting Party. 

9.06 __Allocation Of Purchase Price__. Seller and Acquiror agree to allocate
and, as applicable, to cause their relevant Affiliates to allocate, the
Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration for Tax purposes paid by Acquiror (or any Affiliate of Acquiror)
to Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller) among the asset classes set forth on
IRS Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060) in accordance
with applicable Tax Law and _Section 9.06_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
(collectively, the " _Allocation Principles_ "). Within 90 days after the
Closing Date, Seller will deliver to Acquiror a draft allocation of the
Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration for Tax purposes among such asset classes, which draft
allocation will be prepared in accordance with the Allocation Principles (the
" _Allocation_ "). Acquiror will have the right to review such Allocation and
will notify Seller in writing of any objections within 30 days after receipt
of such Allocation. The Parties will cooperate in good faith to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts, if any. If the Parties are unable
to reach an agreement regarding the Allocation, then within 30 days following
receipt by Seller of Acquirors written objections, any disagreement will be
resolved by the Accounting Firm whose involvement will be limited solely to
disputed

 



75  items. Any Allocation determined pursuant to the decision of the Accounting
Firm will incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the Allocation
Principles. The Allocation, as prepared by Seller if no timely written
objection by Acquiror has been given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement
between the Parties or as determined by the Accounting Firm (the " _Final
Allocation_ "), will be final and binding on all Parties. Any fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm will be borne equally by Acquiror, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand. Acquiror and Seller will each file and,
as applicable, will cause their relevant Affiliates to file, IRS Form 8594 and
any other comparable forms required under applicable Tax Law and all federal,
state, local and foreign Tax Returns, in accordance with the Final Allocation,
unless (and then only to the extent) otherwise required by a Final
Determination. Acquiror and Seller each agrees that it will not take, or
permit any of its Affiliates to take, any Tax position that is inconsistent
with the Final Allocation in any proceeding before any Taxing Authority (or
otherwise), except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a Final
Determination. In the event that a Taxing Authority disputes the Final
Allocation, the Party receiving notice of such dispute will promptly notify
the other Party hereto, and the Parties will reasonably cooperate to defend
the Final Allocation in any applicable proceeding. In the event of any
adjustment to the Final Allocation, the Parties will timely file with the
applicable Taxing Authorities any additional information required to be filed
under applicable Tax Law. Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to
a Final Determination, prior to allocating any consideration for Tax purposes
among assets within any particular asset class set forth on IRS Form 8594,
Seller will consult with Acquiror and Seller will not and will not permit any
of its Affiliates to take any Tax position that is inconsistent with
Acquirors allocation, if any, to such assets; _provided_ , that Acquiror will
advise Seller in writing of any such allocation within 10 days of any request
therefor; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such request will be made by Seller
prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

9.07 __Transfer Taxe__ _s_ _ __._ Seller and Acquiror shall each pay, and be
responsible for, 50% of all Transfer Taxes up to an aggregate amount of $4
million, and Seller shall pay, and be responsible for, all Transfer Taxes in
excess of $4 million; _provided_ , that any additional Transfer Taxes arising
solely as a result of the implementation of an Alternative Transaction
Structure shall be borne by the Party that requested the implementation of
such Alternative Transaction Structure pursuant to _Section 9.05_. Any Tax
Return required to be filed with respect to any such Transfer Taxes shall be
filed by the Person primarily responsible for such filing under applicable
Law; _provided_ that such Party shall deliver a draft of any such Tax Return
to the other Party at least 15 days prior to the due date for the filing of
any such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions), a
statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which the other Party is
responsible pursuant to this _Section 9.07_ and any additional information
relating thereto that the other Party may reasonably request, and shall
reflect on the applicable Tax Return any reasonable comments submitted by such
other Party at least five days prior to the applicable due date. The Parties
shall reasonably cooperate in obtaining any available exemptions or refunds
with respect to Transfer Taxes.

9.08 __Miscellaneous__ _._ (a) Except to the extent expressly contemplated by
this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the
making of any Section 338(g) elections in accordance with _Section 9.08(b)_
below or the Section 

 



76  338(h)(10) Elections, if any, in accordance with _Section 9.08(c)_ below),
Acquiror will not, and will not permit any Affiliate to, take any action on
the Closing Date after the Closing with respect to the Wimbledon Entities or
the other Wimbledon Assets other than in the ordinary course of business.

(b) With respect to any Wimbledon Entity that is classified as a corporation
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes on the Closing Date, Acquiror (or any of
its applicable Affiliates) will have the right to make an election under
Section 338 of the Code (or any similar election permitted under state or
local Law) with respect to the acquisition of such Wimbledon Entity. With
respect to any Wimbledon Entity, Acquiror will not, and will not permit any of
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Wimbledon Entities) to,
cause any election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 to be
filed, or make any other election (other than any such Section 338(g)
election) or filing, in each case, if such election or filing would be
effective on or prior to the Closing Date.

(c) At Acquirors election, Seller will and will cause its applicable
Affiliate to join Acquiror (or any applicable Affiliate of Acquiror) in the
making of a timely and irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code (and any corresponding elections under any applicable state or local
Tax Law) with respect to the acquisition of equity interests in Pringles
Manufacturing Company (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_ "). If the Section
338(h)(10) Elections are made, Seller and Acquiror (i) will cooperate in
the preparation of all forms, attachments and schedules necessary to
effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, including IRS Form 8023 and 8883
and any similar forms under applicable state and local Tax Law (collectively,
the " _Section 338(h)(10) Forms_ ") in a manner consistent with the Final
Allocation and (ii) will, or will cause their relevant Affiliates to, timely
file such Section 338(h)(10) Forms with the applicable Taxing Authorities.
Seller and Acquiror agree that neither of them will, or will permit any of
their Affiliates, to revoke the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, if any,
following the filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Forms, if any, without the
prior written consent of Acquiror or Seller, as the case may be. Except to
the extent otherwise required pursuant to a Final Determination, Seller and
Acquiror will, and will cause their Affiliates to, report consistently with
the Section 338(h)(10) Elections and the Section 338(h)(10) Forms, if any,
and will not, and will not permit any of their Affiliates to, take any
position inconsistent therewith. If the Section 338(h)(10) Elections are made,
each of Seller and Acquiror will deliver to the other party at Closing one or
more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 that reflect the Section 338(h)(10) Election
with respect to the purchase of the equity interests in Pringles Manufacturing
Company.

 

(d) On the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements and arrangements between
(i) any Wimbledon Entity, on the one hand, and (ii) Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than any Wimbledon Entity), on the other hand, will be
terminated effective as of the close of business on the Closing Date and will
have no further effect for any Tax period (whether past, present or future),
and, after the Closing Date, no additional payments will be made thereunder
with respect to any Tax period, whether in respect of a redetermination of
Liabilities for Taxes or otherwise. The Parties will take 

 



77  all steps necessary to ensure that each such termination is effective in the
manner described above.

(e) Each Party will provide the other with such information, records and other
assistance, and make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents
available, as may reasonably be requested by the other Party in connection
with any Tax matter under this _Article IX_ , including the preparation of any
Tax Return and the conduct of any Tax Claim; _provided_ that Acquiror will not
be permitted to inspect or otherwise review any Consolidated Tax Return.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, indemnification for any
and all Tax matters, and the procedures with respect thereto, will be
governed exclusively by this _Article IX_ and the provisions of _Article VIII_
shall not apply. The representations and warranties set forth in _Section
2.10_ shall survive the Closing Date until 60 days following the expiration
of the relevant statute of limitation; _provided_ that the right to be
indemnified with respect to any matter notice of which was provided pursuant

10.06 __Amendments And Waiver__ _s_ _ __._ (a) This Agreement may be amended
and any provision of this Agreement may be waived; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such amendment or waiver will become and remain binding upon a Party
only if such amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by such
Party. No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest
in this Agreement will be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any
part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Party under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 

(b) No delay or failure in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder
will affect or operate as a waiver thereof; nor will any single or partial
exercise thereof or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such
a right, power or remedy preclude any further exercise thereof or of any other
right, power or remedy. Except and solely to the extent set forth in Section
8.06, the rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies that any Party would otherwise have. Any waiver,
permit, consent or approval of any kind or character of any breach or default
under this Agreement or any such waiver of any provision of this Agreement
must satisfy the conditions set forth in _Section 10.06(a)_ and will be
effective only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.

 

10.07 __No Third-Party Beneficiarie__ _s_ _ __._ This Agreement is solely for
the benefit of the Parties and does not confer on third parties (including
any employees of any member of the Seller Group or the Acquiror Group) any
remedy, claim, reimbursement, claim of action or other right in addition to
those existing without reference to this Agreement; _provided __,_ _however
__,_ that this _Section 10.07_ does not limit any rights of Seller pursuant
to _Section 5.08(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 

10.08 __Assignabilit__ _y_ _ __._ No Party may assign its rights or delegate
its duties under this Agreement without the written consent of the other
Party, except that (a) a Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties
under this Agreement to a member of its Group; _provided_ that (i) such member
agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement, (ii) that the assignment or delegation will not relieve any Party
of its indemnification obligations or other obligations in the event of a
breach of this Agreement and (b) after the Closing, Acquiror may in
connection with a sale of all or a majority of the Assets of the Snacks
Business or either the Mechelen or Jackson Plant, assign those portions of
this Agreement inuring for the benefit of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates
in connection with any legal restructuring and/or the sale of any portion of
its assets with the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed or be entitled to assert rights
under this Agreement notwithstanding that Acquiror no longer owns the Snacks
Business and is not therefore directly damaged. Any attempted assignment or
delegation in contravention of the foregoing will be void.

 

10.09 __Construction__. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a substantive part
of or to

 



81  affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever required by
the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure
Letter or Acquiror Disclosure Letter will include the corresponding
masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of nouns,
pronouns, and verbs will include the plural and vice versa. Reference to any
agreement, document, or instrument means such agreement, document,
or instrument as amended or otherwise modified from time to time in
accordance with the terms thereof, and if applicable hereof. The use of the
words "include" or "including" in this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure
Letter or Acquiror Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation". The use of the word "covenant" shall mean
"covenant and agreement". The use of the words "or," "either" or "any" will
not be exclusive. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will
be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise
expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
any provision herein which contemplates the agreement, approval or consent of,
or exercise of any right of, a Party, such Party may give or withhold such
agreement, approval or consent, or exercise such right, in its sole and
absolute discretion, the Parties hereby expressly disclaiming any implied duty
of good faith and fair dealing or similar concept.

10.10 __Severability__. The Parties agree that (a) the provisions of this
Agreement will be severable in the event that for any reason whatsoever any of
the provisions hereof are invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, (b) any
such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provisions will be replaced by
other provisions which are as similar as possible in terms to such invalid,
void or otherwise unenforceable provisions but are valid and enforceable, and
(c) the remaining provisions will remain valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law.

10.11 __Counterparts__. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one Party), each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, and
any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or other electronic transmission, will be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement and will be considered to have
the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party, the other Party
will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting
Party. No Party will raise the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic
means to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine or other electronic means
as a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such Party forever waives
any such defense.

10.12 __Specific Performance__. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to

 



82  prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, without posting any
bond or other surety.

10.13 __Disclosure Letters__. There may be included in the Seller Disclosure
Letter and/or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter items and information that are
not "material," and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an acknowledgment
or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or
information of comparable or greater significance) is "material," or to affect
the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. Matters
reflected in the Seller Disclosure Letter and Acquiror Disclosure Letter are
not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed
therein. The Seller Disclosure Letter and Acquiror Disclosure Letter set forth
items of disclosure with specific reference to the particular Section
or subsection of this Agreement to which the information in the Seller
Disclosure Letter and Acquiror Disclosure Letter, as applicable, relates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any information set forth in one Section of such
disclosure letter will be deemed to apply to each other Section or subsection
thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face.

 

10.14 __Waiver__. Acquiror acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that Jones Day has represented, is representing and will continue
to represent Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and that Jones Day will only represent
the interests of Seller in connection with such transactions. Acquiror
waives, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, any conflict of interest that
it or they may assert against Jones Day in connection with such representation
and agrees not to challenge Jones Days representation of Seller with respect
to such transactions or to assert that a conflict of interest exists with
respect to such representation. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Acquiror agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that Jones
Day may represent Seller in any litigation, arbitration, mediation or other
Action against or involving Acquiror and/or any of its Affiliates, arising out
of or in connection with such transactions.

 

10.15 __Dispute Resolution__. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, the procedures set forth in
this _Section 10.15_ will govern dispute resolution of any Direct Claim under
_Section 8.04_ (a " _Dispute_ "). Acquiror, on the one hand, and Seller, on
the other hand, will have the right to refer any such Dispute for resolution
to either the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of Acquiror
or the Chief Financial Officer of Seller (or their designees) by delivering to
the other Party a written notice of the referral (a " _Dispute Escalation
Notice_ "). Following receipt of a Dispute Escalation Notice, each of the
Parties will cause their respective officer or designee to negotiate in good
faith to resolve the Dispute. If such officers or designees are unable to
resolve the Dispute within 40 Business Days after the date of the Dispute
Escalation Notice, either Party will have the right to begin mediation in
accordance with _Section 10.15(b)_. The Parties agree that all discussions,
negotiations and other Information exchanged between the Parties during the
foregoing escalation proceedings or those in _Section 10.15(b)_ below will be
without prejudice to the legal position of a Party in any subsequent Action.

 



83 (b) If the Dispute has not been resolved by the negotiation procedures as
provided in  _Section 10.15(a)_ within 40 Business Days after delivery of
the Dispute Escalation Notice, or if the Parties failed to meet within 40
Business Days after delivery, the Parties will endeavor to settle the Dispute
by mediation administered by the Delaware Court of Chancery under 10 Del. C.
Sec. 347 (commonly referred to as the " _Mediation Only Program_ ");
_provided_ __, _however_ , that if the Dispute does not qualify for, or the
Parties are not eligible to participate in, the Mediation Only Program, the
Parties will endeavor to agree on an alternative mediating body to administer
mediation of the Dispute under its Commercial Mediation Procedures, in which
case the Parties will not be restricted in the identities of mediators that
they may propose to utilize in the mediation. If the Dispute is not resolved
in mediation (or if the Parties are unable to agree on a mediator pursuant to
the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence), either Party will have
the right to commence litigation in accordance with _Section 10.04_.
