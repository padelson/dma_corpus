to such shares of Theta Common Stock pursuant to an exchange agent agreement
that is reasonably acceptable to Theta, Kappa and Kappa, Inc. Kappa, on behalf
of Kappa, Inc., shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the

to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of

Agent to mail to each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose shares
were converted pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii) into the right to receive the

(which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Kappa, Kappa,
Inc. and Theta and shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or,
in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth
in the letter of transmittal) and (B) instructions to effect the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 3.2(c). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) Kappa Shares
representing that number of whole Kappa Shares that such holder has the right
to receive in respect of the aggregate number of shares of Theta Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to
Section 3.1 and (y) a check representing cash in lieu of fractional shares
that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and in
respect of any dividends or other distributions that the holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 3.2(c). Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 3.1(b), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
such surrender, the Merger Consideration that the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share has the right to receive in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 3.1 (and cash in respect of any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 3.2(c)). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

  

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Kappa
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Kappa
Shares deliverable upon surrender thereof until the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this ARTICLE III. Subject
to escheat or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder thereof,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such number of whole Kappa Shares that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii) and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such number
of whole Kappa Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1(a)(iii).

  

(d) The Kappa Shares delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this ARTICLE III upon conversion of any shares of Theta Common Stock shall be
deemed to have been delivered and paid by Kappa on behalf of Kappa, Inc. in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Theta Common
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of Theta
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or
other distributions that holders have the right to receive upon the surrender
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 3.2(c),
without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of Theta shall be closed
with respect to all shares of Theta Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Theta Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Theta Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Kappa, Kappa, Inc. or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE III.

  

(e) No fractional Kappa Shares will be delivered in connection with the
Merger, no certificates or scrip representing fractional Kappa Shares shall be
delivered upon the conversion of Theta Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1,
and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a holder of Kappa Shares. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Theta Common Stock
converted pursuant to Section 3.1 who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a Kappa Share shall receive from the Exchange Agent, in
lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount representing such holder\'s
proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent
on behalf of all such holders of Kappa Shares which would otherwise be
delivered (the " _Excess Kappa Merger Shares_ "). The sale of the Excess Kappa
Merger Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the US Exchange,
through one or more member firms of such exchange. Until the net proceeds of
such sale or sales have been distributed to such holders of shares of Theta
Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such
holders (the " _Fractional Interests Trust_ "). Kappa, Inc. shall pay all
commissions, transfer Taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs incurred
in connection with such sale of the Excess Kappa Merger Shares. The Exchange
Agent shall determine the portion of the Fractional Interests Trust to which
each holder of shares of Theta Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Fractional
Interests Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of
fractional interests to which such holder of shares of Theta Common Stock is
entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional
interests to which all holders of shares of Theta Common Stock are entitled.
As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any,
to be paid to holders of shares of Theta Common Stock in lieu of fractional
interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such
holders of shares of Theta Common Stock. Any such sale shall be made within
ten (10) Business Days or such shorter period as may be required by applicable
Law after the Effective Time.

  

(f) If, for any reason (including losses), the Exchange Agent shall not have
sufficient funds or Kappa Shares to pay the amounts to which holders of Theta
Common Stock are entitled under this ARTICLE III, Kappa, Inc. and the
Surviving Corporation shall take all steps necessary to promptly deposit with
the Exchange Agent additional cash and shall cause Kappa, on behalf of and for
the benefit of Kappa, Inc., to take all steps necessary to promptly deposit
with the Exchange Agent Kappa Shares sufficient to make all payments required
under this ARTICLE III. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any
interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Kappa, Inc. or its designee upon demand, and any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this
ARTICLE III shall thereafter look only to Kappa, Inc. for satisfaction of its
claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this ARTICLE III.

  

(g) None of Theta, Kappa, Kappa, Inc., Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund or the
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the
cash to be paid in accordance with this ARTICLE III that remains undistributed
to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the second
anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Kappa, Inc. or its
designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  

(h) Any cash in the Exchange Fund may only be invested by the Exchange Agent
in accordance with the exchange agent agreement, _provided_ that, subject to
Section 3.2(g), no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the cash
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Any interest or other
amounts received with respect to such investments shall be paid to Kappa, Inc.

  

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Kappa, Inc. or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Kappa, Inc. or
the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the
termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section 3.2(g), Kappa, Inc.)
shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(j) In the event Kappa ADSs (instead of Kappa Shares) are issued pursuant to
_Section 3.1(d)_ , any reference to Kappa Shares in this _Section 3.2_ shall
be deemed to refer to Kappa ADSs instead where appropriate.

Option_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of Theta (the "

the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Theta Common Stock
subject to such option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, and such Kappa Stock Option shall have an exercise price per

together with the Theta Stock Options and the Theta Restricted Shares, the "
_Theta Stock Awards_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

(3) Business Days of making such disclosure.

respects with this Section 7.2, (ii) the Kappa Board has given Theta at least
five (5) Business Days\' prior written notice (it being understood that any
amendment or modification to any Acquisition Proposal or any material change

require the delivery of a new written notice and a new five (5)-Business Day
period) of its intention to take such action and a description of the reasons
for taking such action, (iii) if requested by Theta, Kappa has negotiated, and
has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Theta during

Recommendation unless Kappa publicly reaffirms the Kappa Board Recommendation
within three (3) Business Days of making such disclosure.

written Acquisition Proposal (other than any Acquisition Proposal which has

faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel
and taking into account all financial, legal and regulatory terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, including any

alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement) proposed by any other Party pursuant to this Section 7.2 and (ii)

required by applicable Law (it being understood that if any such statements or
disclosures constitute a Theta Change of Recommendation or Kappa Change of

Shareholders Meeting and Kappa shall be entitled to delay the Kappa

contemplated by this Agreement. If any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or

jurisdiction, or to obtain a CFIUS Approval, to ensure that no Governmental
Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction
(preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law, rule, regulation or other
action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, including accepting operational restrictions or
limitations and committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale, license, disposition or holding

approval of any Governmental Entity with respect to any Antitrust Laws or
Exon-Florio, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order
or any other order in any suit or proceeding with respect to any Antitrust

take any other action with respect to any assets, businesses, or interests in
any assets or businesses of Theta or Kappa or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates (or to consent to any sale, divestiture or holding
separate, or agreement to sell, divest or hold separate by Theta or Kappa or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, as the case may be, of any
of its assets, businesses or interests in any of its assets or businesses), if
(i) such action would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Substantial Detriment or (ii) if such action is not
contingent upon the consummation of the Closing. Subject to applicable Law and
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, Theta and Kappa shall keep each
other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing
outside counsel for the other Party with copies of notices or other

practicable, each will consult the other on any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity, in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. (i) To the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity and (ii) to
the extent that the communication or meeting relates to a national security

_further_ , that materials provided pursuant to this Section 7.4 or any
subsection thereof may, to the extent permitted by Law or the Governmental
Entity, be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements with third parties and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns. The parties hereto agree to treat information protected

its properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, each
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested; _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this
Section 7.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by Theta or Kappa; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not
require Theta or Kappa (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of Theta or Kappa, as the case
may be, would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties
or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality or (ii) to
disclose any privileged information of Theta or Kappa, as the case may be, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries _provided_ that, in either such case, the
parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide
for an arrangement that permits the exchange of such information, such as a
joint defense or similar arrangement. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be directed to an executive officer of
Theta or Kappa, as the case may be, or such Person as may be designated by
either of their executive officers, as the case may be, with a copy to the
General Counsel of such party. All such information shall be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

Section 7.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding this Agreement
and the Merger shall be a joint press release, and Theta and Kappa shall use
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party
shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that all press releases and other

other party\'s business, financial condition or results of operations, to the

will indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is,
or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of Theta
or its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties\' service
as a director or officer of Theta or its Subsidiaries or services performed by
such persons at the request of Theta or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i)
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce
this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any
Indemnified Party. The Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and limitations on, or exculpation from, liabilities, for acts or
omissions that are at least as favorable to the directors, officers or
employees of Theta as those contained in the Constituent Documents of Theta as
in effect on the date hereof, except to the extent prohibited by applicable
Law, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for
a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by Law.

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Kappa shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain Theta\'s existing policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance for the benefit of those
persons who are covered by such policies at the Effective Time (or Theta may

matters occurring prior to the Effective Time), to the extent that such
liability insurance can be maintained at a cost to Theta not greater than 300%
of the annual premium (such 300% threshold, the " _Maximum Premium_ ") for the
current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies as set forth
in Section 7.10(b) __ of the Theta Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that, if such
insurance cannot be so maintained or obtained at such cost, Kappa shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain policies of insurance which in Kappa\'s
good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage reasonably obtainable
at an annual premium amount not in excess of the Maximum Premium; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Theta may
purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six (6)-year prepaid
"tail" insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the
Merger) of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the directors and officers of Theta
and its Subsidiaries than the existing directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policies, at an annual premium no greater than the Maximum Premium.

  

(c) If Theta or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Theta or the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
Effective Time, Kappa shall, for the benefit of the directors and officers of

liabilities under U.S. securities laws or (ii) amend the terms of its existing
liability insurance to remove the exclusion of liability under U.S. securities
laws.

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.10 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives,
each of which shall be a third-party beneficiary of the provisions of this
Section 7.10.

  

Section 7.11 _Actions with Respect to Existing Theta Indebtedness_.

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Theta shall either (i) terminate the Theta
Credit Facility (including by refinancing the amounts outstanding and the
commitments thereunder with new Financing) or (ii) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, on or before the Effective Time, the necessary
consents (the " _Requisite Lender Consents_ ") of lenders party to (A) the
Theta Credit Facility to allow the Theta Credit Facility to remain in effect
after the Effective Time with no default or event of default thereunder
resulting from the Merger or the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, with no (x) reduction of the outstanding amounts or
lending or other financing commitments thereunder or (y) shortening of any
maturity thereunder; _provided_ that nothing contained in this Section 7.11(a)
shall require Theta to accept any terms or conditions with respect to the
Theta Credit Facility that are not commercially reasonable (giving effect to
the then-current economic environment). If applicable, Theta shall deliver to
Kappa drafts of all agreements to be entered into with its lenders in
connection with obtaining the Requisite Lender Consents or any replacement
Financing and shall keep Kappa informed in all material respects of the status
of Theta\'s efforts to obtain the Requisite Lender Consents or any replacement
Financing. Kappa shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Theta to obtain the Requisite Lender Consents or any replacement Financing to
the extent reasonably requested by Theta.

  

(b) Theta shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the transactions
described in _Section 7.11(b)_ of the Theta Disclosure Letter to the extent
set forth thereon (such transactions, the " _Financing Related Transactions_
"). Each Party shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide to the other
Party all cooperation reasonably requested by the other Party in connection
with the Financing and the applicable Financing Related Transactions (
_provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of such Party and its Subsidiaries), including
using commercially reasonable efforts to:

  

 

(i) prepare and furnish to the other Party as promptly as reasonably
practicable all pertinent information (financial or otherwise), financial
statements and disclosures regarding such Party and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested by the other Party (or by the Financing sources) to
assist in the preparation of the documents relating to the Financing, and the
applicable Financing Related Transactions;

  

(ii) participate as necessary (including by senior management) in a reasonable
number of meetings (including one-on-one meetings or conference calls with the
Financing sources or the holders of Theta\'s senior notes or parties acting as
agents for any such holders), presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies and prospective
lenders and purchasers of the Financing, and generally reasonably cooperate
with the other Party;

  

(iii) assist with the preparation of, and execution and delivery of, the

information memoranda, materials for rating agency presentations, projections,
customary pro forma financial information and financial statements,
reconciliations between IFRS and US GAAP, customary representation or
authorization letters, solvency certificates and other customary documents;

  

(iv) reasonably facilitate the taking of all corporate actions by such Party
and its Subsidiaries with respect to entering into such documents or as
otherwise may be necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing and the
applicable Financing Related Transactions;

  

(v) furnishing the other Party and the Financing sources promptly with all

anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act;

  

(vi) using reasonable best efforts to cause accountants to consent to the use
of their reports in any materials relating to the Financing and to deliver

Each Party further agrees to supplement the information provided pursuant to
this Section 7.11 __ on a current basis to the extent that any such
information, to its knowledge, contains any material misstatement of fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary to make such information not
misleading in any material respect.

 

  

(c) Each Party\'s logos may be used in connection with the Financing; provided
that such logos are used solely in the manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage such Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(d) No agreement or arrangement with respect to any Financing shall be entered
into without the prior written consent of Kappa and Theta. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this Section 7.11 shall require Kappa or Theta or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to incur any indebtedness (other than Financing
Expenses in accordance with Section 7.9), give any guarantee or grant any Lien
over any asset or property of Kappa or its Subsidiaries in connection with any
Financing or Financing Related Transaction, unless any such incurrance of
indebtedness, guarantee or grant of Lien is conditional upon Closing and
otherwise agreed to in writing by Kappa or Theta, as applicable.

  

Section 7.12 _Other Actions by Theta and Kappa_.

insurers to provide that the Continuing Employees shall receive full credit
for service with Theta or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and determination of benefits under severance and
vacation pay plans, to the same extent that such service was recognized as of
the Closing Date under a comparable Benefit Plan in which the Continuing

such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods were satisfied or waived under the comparable
Benefit Plan in which the Continuing Employees participated and (ii) cause any
health benefit plan of Kappa or its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing
Employees participate after the Closing Date to recognize the dollar amount of
all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying deductible and co-
payment limitations for such year under the relevant welfare benefit plans in
which such Continuing Employee (and dependents) participates following the
Closing Date.

  

(d) Prior to the Closing, Kappa and Theta shall cooperate to identify those

honor, fulfill and discharge Theta\'s and its Subsidiaries\' obligations under

Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending or
terminating any Benefit Plan, (iii) confer upon any individual any right to
continued employment or service or limit the ability of Kappa or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to terminate the employment
or service of any individual, (iv) limit Kappa\'s ability to restructure or
reorganize its businesses, (v) require Kappa to provide any compensation or
benefits with respect to any change in control or similar transaction
occurring after the Closing or (vi) confer any rights or benefits on any

opinion from any labor union, labor organization, works council or group of
employees of Theta and its Subsidiaries in connection with the transaction
contemplated in this Agreement.

  

Section 7.14 _Transaction Litigation_. Without limiting in any way the
parties\' hereto obligations under Section 7.4, each of Theta and Kappa shall
give the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limiting
in any way the parties\' hereto obligations under Section 7.4, each of Theta
and Kappa shall cooperate, shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
cooperate, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives to cooperate, in the defense against such Transaction
Litigation.

  

Section 7.15 _Delisting_. The Parties agree to cooperate with each other in
taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Theta

be, and, despite the party subject to the legal action having vigorously
defended against such legal action, it is concluded by a final non-appealable
judgment or decision of a court of competent jurisdiction that the decision by
the Kappa Board or the Theta Board, as applicable, to enter into the
agreements under Section 10.5(b), Section 10.5(c), Section 10.5(d), or Section
10.5(e), as applicable, is unlawful or unenforceable, then the Party that

termination payment under Section 10.5(b), Section 10.5(c), Section 10.5(d),
or Section 10.5(e), as applicable, the portion of such termination payment (to
the extent already paid) that such court has determined to be unlawful or

(h) At the Recipient\'s option, the Recipient shall be entitled to assume and
control the defense of any legal action referred to in Section 10.5(g) subject
to the Recipient assuming all the costs relating to such defense. In the event
that the Recipient assumes such defense, the other Party shall fully cooperate
with the Recipient\'s defense of such legal action, including by providing to
the Recipient all such information regarding the other Party and its Board of

made pursuant to Section 10.5(b), Section 10.5(c), Section 10.5(d), or Section
10.5(e) shall constitute liquidated damages, and from and after the
termination giving rise to such payment, neither Party shall have any further
liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the
termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under this Section
10.5. In no event shall any Party be entitled to payment under Section
10.5(b), Section 10.5(c), Section 10.5(d), or Section 10.5(e) on more than one

Section 11.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits
hereto), and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 12, 2015, between Theta
and Kappa (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties
hereto, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

Section 11.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section
7.10 (Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance), this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third-party beneficiaries under Section 7.10 shall
not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

  

Section 11.10 _Obligations of Kappa_. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger
Sub or to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Kappa to cause Merger Sub to take such action and a
guarantee of the performance thereof.

  

Section 11.11 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex I_ is
defined on the page of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

  

Section 11.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  

Section 11.13 _Interpretation; Construction_.

  

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to a Section of, Schedule to, Annex of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The term "knowledge of Theta" shall be
deemed to mean the actual knowledge of the individuals set forth in Section
11.13 of the Theta Disclosure Letter, after reasonable inquiry. The term
"knowledge of Kappa" shall be deemed to mean the actual knowledge of the
individuals set forth in Section 11.13 of the Kappa Disclosure Letter, after
reasonable inquiry.

  

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

  

Section 11.14 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, including by way of operation of law or otherwise, by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other party;
_provided_ , _however_ , each of Kappa and Merger Sub may, with the consent of
Theta (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
assign this Agreement, or any portion of, or any of its obligations under,
this Agreement, to one or more (i) direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of Kappa or Merger Sub, as applicable, (ii) parent companies
that, directly or indirectly wholly-own Kappa or Merger Sub, as applicable, or
(iii) any Person that is controlled by the same Person or Persons that control
Kappa or Merger Sub, as applicable.

  

Section 11.15 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. The rights and
remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The
parties hereto agree that, in the event of any actual or threatened breach or
failure to comply by any party hereto of or with any covenant, obligation or
other provision set forth in this Agreement: (a) any other party hereto shall
be entitled, without any proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to such other party hereto), to: (i) demand, or
seek an Order of, specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant, obligation or other provision and (ii) seek an
injunction restraining such actual or threatened breach or failure; and (b)
such other party hereto shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such demand, Order or injunction or in
connection with any related action or legal proceeding.

  

Section 11.16 _Guarantee_. Kappa agrees to take all action necessary to cause
Kappa, Inc. and Merger Sub, as applicable, to perform all of its respective
agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement. Kappa
unconditionally guarantees to Theta the full and complete performance by
Kappa, Inc. and Merger Sub of their respective obligations under this
Agreement and shall be liable for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation of Kappa, Inc. or Merger Sub under this Agreement. This
is a guarantee of payment and performance and not collectibility. Kappa hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any
right to require any proceeding first against Kappa, Inc. or Merger Sub. as
applicable, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in connection with the
performance of its obligations set forth in this _Section 11.16_.
