the Company and the Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

  



  

1.02.   _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger:

  



  

(a) The share transfer books of the Company will be closed, and thereafter
there will be no further registration of transfers of Company Stock
theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law.

  



  

(b) Each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, if any)
will be automatically converted into a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Liquidation Value of such share of Preferred
Stock (the aggregate consideration to which holders of Preferred Stock become
entitled pursuant to this _Section 1.02(b)_ is referred to herein as the "
_Preferred Stock Merger Consideration_ "). The Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration will be paid in the manner provided in _Section 1.02(d)_.

  



  

   

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and each share of Restricted Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will vest in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of the
Company Equity Plan and the applicable Restricted Stock Agreement or any other
applicable agreement pursuant to which such Restricted Stock was granted
(other than, in each case, Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, if any),
will be automatically converted into the right to receive (i) the Per Common
Share Closing Cash Consideration, (ii) the Per Common Share Parent Stock
Consideration and the (iii) Per Common Share Post-Closing Consideration
(including interest that may be payable under the Escrow Agreement, if any)
(the aggregate consideration to which holders of Common Stock become
entitled pursuant to this _Section 1.02(c)_ is referred to herein as the "
_Common Stock Merger Consideration_ "). The Common Stock Merger Consideration
will be paid in the manner provided in _Section 1.02(d)_.

  



  

(d) Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent will deliver an amount equal
to the Closing Cash Consideration to the Exchange Agent at the Closing by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in
writing by the Exchange Agent, with such account(s) to be established,
maintained and administered by the Exchange Agent pursuant to the terms and
conditions of a exchange agent agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit
B_ attached hereto, to be entered into at least four Business Days prior to
the Closing Date by Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the
Exchange Agent (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "). Parent will also deliver
the Parent Stock Consideration to the Exchange Agent pursuant to the terms of
the Exchange Agent Agreement. After the Closing, promptly following delivery
to the Exchange Agent of a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal,
along with a properly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or if
applicable, the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Form W-8), substantially
in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "),
the Exchange Agent will (and Parent will direct the Exchange Agent to)
promptly pay (i) to each Preferred Stockholder that delivers a duly executed
and completed Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with _Section 1.10_ and
_Section 1.11_, an amount equal to the Liquidation Value multiplied by the
number of shares of Preferred Stock held of record by such Preferred
Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) to each Common
Stockholder that delivers a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal,
in accordance with _Section 1.10_ and _Section 1.11_, (a) an amount equal
to the Per Common Share Closing Cash Consideration and (b) the Per Common
Share Parent Stock Consideration, each as multiplied by the number of shares
of Common Stock held of record by such Common Stockholder immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided, that the amounts paid under the foregoing
clause (a) shall be net of any indebtedness of such Common Stockholder due to
the Company as of the Closing and the amount of any such indebtedness shall
be paid by the Exchange Agent to the Surviving Company in satisfaction of
such indebtedness. The Exchange Agent will (and Parent will direct the
Exchange Agent to) (A) pay the amounts described in the preceding sentence on
the Closing Date to any Stockholder (other than Employee Restricted
Stockholders in respect of shares of Restricted Stock for which an election
under Section 83(b) of the Code has not been filed) that delivers its duly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent at least
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (B) subject to _Section 1.10_
and _Section 1.11_, pay (or cause to be paid) the amounts described in the
preceding sentence to any other Stockholder within three Business Days after
such Stockholder (other than Employee Restricted Stockholders in respect of
shares of Restricted Stock for which an election under Section 83(b) of
the Code has not been filed) delivers its duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent and (C) in accordance with _Section
1.11_ deliver to the Surviving Company the amounts described in the preceding
sentence on the Closing Date payable to any Employee Restricted Stockholder
in respect of shares of Restricted Stock for which an election under Section
83(b) of the Code has not been filed. None of Parent, the Exchange Agent,
the Surviving Company nor their Affiliates will be liable to any Stockholder
for any amount paid to any public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amount remaining unclaimed by the
Stockholders three years after the Closing Date (or such earlier date,
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) will become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Each share of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, if any, held immediately
prior to the Effective Time by Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company
(collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") will be automatically canceled and
no payment will be made with respect thereto.

  



  

(f) Each share of common stock of the Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
automatically converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company.

  



  

1.03. _Reimbursement Fund Amount_. Concurrent with the Effective Time,
Parent will deliver the sum of $1,500,000 (the " _Reimbursement Fund Amount_
") to the Stockholder Representative at the Closing by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Stockholder
Representative. The purpose of the Reimbursement Fund Amount is to provide the
Stockholder Representative with funds to cover out-of-pocket expenses it
incurs in serving as the Stockholders' representative for the purposes stated
in this Agreement. Other than reimbursement for its out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in serving as the Stockholders' representative, the Stockholder
Representative will not be compensated for providing services hereunder. If
the Stockholder Representative determines in its sole discretion to return
all or any portion of the Reimbursement Fund Amount to the Common
Stockholders, it will distribute to each Common Stockholder entitled to
receive payments under _Section 1.02(d)_ its Pro Rata Share of the amount to
be distributed. Payments to Common Stockholders under this _Section 1.03_
will be paid in accordance with  _Section 1.10_ and _Section 1.11_.

  



  

1.04.   _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, the Merger
Sub, the Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of any of the
foregoing, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company will be
amended and restated in its entirety in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
D _until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 9.01_, in accordance with
the provisions thereof and the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the
Surviving Company will be amended and restated to be in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit E_, until thereafter amended, subject to _Section 9.01_,
in accordance with the provisions thereof, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company and the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no such amendment to the certificate of incorporation or the
bylaws of the Surviving Company will diminish the exculpation, indemnification
or expense advancement or reimbursement provisions in respect of directors or
officers of the Company or any other Group Company that held office as of the
date hereof in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

1.05.   _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected, appointed or otherwise designated in
accordance with applicable Law, the directors of the Merger Sub at the
Effective Time will be the directors of the Surviving Company (and any other
directors of the Company will be deemed to have been removed as of the
Effective Time), and the officers of the Company at the Effective Time will
be the officers of the Surviving Company, each such initial director and
initial officer of the Surviving Company to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company as in
effect from and after the Effective Time.

1.06.   _Closing Calculations_. Not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Parent a
statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (a) an
estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Group Companies as of the
Reference Time, (b) the Company's good faith estimate of (i) Cash as of the
Reference Time (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (ii) Indebtedness as of the
Reference Time, including the Payoff Amount (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_
"), (iii) Net Working Capital as of the Reference Time (the " _Estimated Net
Working Capital_ ") and the Target Net Working Capital Amount (the "
_Estimated Target Net Working Capital Amount_ "), (iv) Company Transaction
Expenses (the " _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_ ") and (v) the
Acquisition Adjustment Amount as of the Reference Time (the " _Estimated
Acquisition Adjustment Amount_ "), which statement the Company will confirm
in writing has been prepared using the Preparation Methodology and will
include materials showing in reasonable detail the Company's support and
computations for the amounts included in the Estimated Closing Statement, (c)
consistent with the foregoing calculations, the Company's determination of (i)
the Closing Aggregate Merger Consideration, (ii) the Per Common Share Closing
Cash Consideration and (iii) the Per Common Share Parent Stock Consideration,
and (d) the amount of the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration. The Estimated
Closing Statement and the determinations contained therein will be prepared
in accordance with the Preparation Methodology as set forth in _Exhibit F_
(the " _Preparation Methodology_ "). Parent shall be entitled to review and
make reasonable objections to the matters and amounts set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement delivered by the Company pursuant to this
_Section 1.06_. The Company will cooperate with Parent in the review of the
Estimated Closing Statement, including providing Parent and its
representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
relevant books, records and finance employees of the Company. Based on
Parent's reasonable objections, the Company and Parent will cooperate
reasonably to update the Estimated Closing Statement delivered by the Company
under this  _Section 1.06_ , prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

1.07.   _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Parent will prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative, no
later than 60 days after the Closing Date (the " _60-Day Period_ "), a
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (i) the consolidated
balance sheet of the Group Companies as of the Reference Time and (ii)
Parent's determination of (A) Cash as of the Reference Time, (B) Indebtedness
as of the Reference Time, (C) Net Working Capital as of the Reference Time and
the Target Net Working Capital Amount, (D) Company Transaction Expenses and
(E) the Acquisition Adjustment Amount as of the Reference Time, which
statement Parent will confirm in writing has been prepared using the
Preparation Methodology and will include materials showing in reasonable
detail Parent's support and computations for the amounts included in the
Closing Statement. If Parent does not deliver the Closing Statement to the
Stockholder Representative within the 60-Day Period, either, at the election
of the Stockholder Representative, (x) Parent will be deemed to have waived
the right to object to any items set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement,
all such items will be deemed to be final and binding on the Parties and the
Stockholders and will be non-appealable and may be enforced by a court of
competent jurisdiction for purposes of determining the Final Aggregate Merger
Consideration, as described below in this _Section 1.0_ _7_ , or (y) the
Stockholder Representative will prepare and deliver to Parent, no later than
45 days after the 60-Day Period, the Closing Statement (as prepared by the
Stockholder Representative, the " _Representative Closing Statement_ ").

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) During the 30-day period following the Stockholder Representative's
receipt of the Closing Statement or during the 60-day period following the
Stockholder Representative's election to prepare the Representative Closing
Statement in accordance with _Section 1.07(a)_ , as applicable (either such
period, the " _Response Period_ "), Parent will provide the Stockholder
Representative and its representatives with access to those of the Group
Companies' accounting records (other than the Group Companies' accountant's
work papers, unless the Group Companies' accountants agree to provide same)
that directly relate to the items in the Closing Statement or the
Representative Closing Statement, as applicable, that the Stockholder
Representative reasonably requests. If the Stockholder Representative claims
that Parent has failed to comply with its obligation under this _Section
1.07(b)_ to provide access to books, records, and personnel, the Stockholder
Representative must submit such claim for resolution to the Accounting Firm,
which will have the authority to determine such matter and, to the extent
that Parent has so failed to comply, to extend the Response Period until the
date that is 30 days after Parent complies with its access obligations
hereunder. Prior to the expiration of the Response Period, the Stockholder
Representative may deliver either (i) a written objection to Parent's
calculation of the items stated in the Closing Statement, identifying each
item (i.e., on an item-by-item basis) in dispute and the dollar amount in
dispute for each item or (ii) if so elected by the Stockholder Representative
in accordance with _Section 1.07(a)_ , the Representative Closing Statement
(either such statement, the " _Objection Statement_ "). If the Stockholder
Representative chooses to deliver an Objection Statement during the Response
Period, the Stockholder Representative will also deliver materials showing in
reasonable detail the Stockholder Representative's basis, support and
computations for its position and the amounts it claims are in dispute or that
differ between the Closing Statement and the Objection Statement. The
Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders will be deemed to have waived
the right to object to any item set forth in the Closing Statement unless the
Stockholder Representative furnishes the Objection Statement to Parent within
the Response Period. In the case of such waiver, all items stated in the
Closing Statement will be deemed to be final and binding on the Parties and
the Stockholders and will be non-appealable and may be enforced by a court of
competent jurisdiction for purposes of this Agreement, including determining
the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration. If the Stockholder
Representative delivers an Objection Statement within the Response Period,
then the Stockholder Representative and Parent will meet within 15 days (in
person or by teleconference) after the delivery of the Objection Statement to
discuss each other's position and to attempt to resolve their differences. If
Parent and the Stockholder Representative are not able to resolve their
differences at such meeting (or by any later date mutually agreed to by
them), Parent and the Stockholder Representative will prepare a list of the
items that remain in dispute (the " _Disputed Items_ "), which Disputed Items
will be limited to those items and amounts listed in the Objection Statement
that remain unresolved. Parent and the Stockholder Representative will
separately prepare statements (each, a " _Position Statement_ ") specifying
in reasonable detail their respective positions on each of the Disputed Items
(including the dollar amount for each item). The Stockholder Representative
and Parent will exchange their Position Statements with one another within 20
days after the meeting at which the Disputed Items list was prepared.
Each Party's Position Statement will include only those items and amounts in
dispute as specified in the Objection Statement (but with reference to the
Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement, as applicable).

  



  

   

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If within 15 days after Parent and the Stockholder Representative have
exchanged Position Statements, Parent and the Stockholder Representative are
unable to agree on the amounts of Cash as of the Reference Time, Indebtedness
as of the Reference Time, Net Working Capital as of the Reference Time, the
Target Net Working Capital Amount, Company Transaction Expenses or the
Acquisition Adjustment Amount as of the Reference Time in accordance with the
above procedures, Parent or the Stockholder Representative will submit the
list of the Disputed Items (together with both Position Statements) to be
resolved by BDO USA, LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to perform
its obligations under this _Section 1.07_ , such other accounting firm as
Parent and the Stockholder Representative mutually agree (the " _Accounting
Firm_ "). If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are not able to agree
to a list of Disputed Items, the Accounting Firm may also be retained to
determine the contents of such list based solely on the Objection Statement
and the materials accompanying same (but with reference to the Estimated
Closing Statement and the Closing Statement, as applicable). Regardless of
which Party submits the matter to the Accounting Firm for resolution, within
five days of the Accounting Firm's request, both Parent and the Stockholder
Representative will enter into the Accounting Firm's standard engagement
letter and both will instruct the Accounting Firm to resolve each of the
Disputed Items (but no other items) within 60 days of being engaged or as
soon as practicable thereafter. The cost of any retainer payment required by
the Accounting Firm will be paid equally by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative, subject to ultimate apportionment as provided in this
_Section 1.07(c)_. The Stockholder Representative and Parent will cooperate
with the Accounting Firm in all reasonable respects, but neither Party will
have ex parte meetings, teleconferences or other correspondence with the
Accounting Firm (except to the extent that such ex parte discussions solely
concern the Accounting Firm's discussions with such party regarding a
potential conflict), as it is intended for each of the Stockholder
Representative and Parent to be included in all discussions and
correspondence with the Accounting Firm. In resolving each of the Disputed
Items, the Accounting Firm will be authorized only to choose between the
Stockholder Representative's position and Parent's position (as each
position had been disclosed to the other in its respective Position
Statement, as amended in the manner provided below), but recognizing that the
Accounting Firm may resolve the Disputed Items on an item-by-item basis so
that it may choose the Stockholder Representative's position on some items
and Parent's position on other items. If Parent or the Stockholder
Representative fails to provide the other with its Position Statement within
the 20-day period referenced in _Section 1.07(b)_ or fails to enter into
the Accounting Firm's standard engagement letter in a timely manner, all of
the Disputed Items will be deemed resolved in the manner set forth in the
other Party's Position Statement. If both the Stockholder Representative and
Parent present the other with its Position Statement within the 20-day period
referenced in _Section 1.07(b)_ , then the Accounting Firm will be permitted
to ask questions of the Parties with respect to either or both Position
Statements. The Accounting Firm will notify the Stockholder Representative
and Parent in writing of its resolution of each of the Disputed Items,
together with a reasonably detailed explanation of its determination of each
Disputed Item, and its calculation of Cash as of the Reference Time,
Indebtedness as of the Reference Time, Net Working Capital as of the
Reference Time, the Target Net Working Capital Amount, Company
Transaction Expenses and the Acquisition Adjustment Amount as of the
Reference Time based on its resolution of the Disputed Items. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm will be apportioned equitably by the
Accounting Firm based on the degree to which each Party failed to prevail in
its position. The determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the
Disputed Items and the apportionment of fees and expenses will be final and
binding on the Parties and the Stockholders, will be non-appealable and may be
enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

   

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) The final Cash as of the Reference Time (the " _Final Cash_ "), the final
Indebtedness as of the Reference Time (the " _Final Indebtedness_ "), the
final Net Working Capital as of the Reference Time (the " _Final Net Working
Capital_ ") and the final Target Net Working Capital Amount (the " _Final
Target Net Working Capital Amount_ "), the final Company Transaction Expenses
(the " _Final Company Transaction Expenses_ ") and the final
Acquisition Adjustment Amount (the " _Final Acquisition Adjustment Amount_ ")
will be (i) as stated in the Estimated Closing Statement or the Closing
Statement, as applicable, if the Stockholder Representative fails to deliver
an Objection Statement during the applicable Response Period or (ii) if the
Stockholder Representative delivers an Objection Statement within the Response
Period, (A) the amounts mutually agreed to by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative and (B) if any Disputed Item is submitted for resolution to
the Accounting Firm, the amount of each Disputed Item as determined by the
Accounting Firm.

  



  

(e) If the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration exceeds the Closing Aggregate
Merger Consideration, of such excess, Parent will pay or cause to be paid to
the Stockholder Representative any amount incurred by the Stockholder
Representative in performing its services under this Agreement that is
reasonably likely to exceed the Reimbursement Fund Amount (as determined and
specified in writing via notice by the Stockholder Representative to Parent,
prior to the determination of the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration, in
good faith), and of the balance of such excess, Parent will promptly (but in
any event within five Business Days following the final determination of the
Final Aggregate Merger Consideration) pay to the Exchange Agent to distribute
(and Parent will direct the Exchange Agent to so distribute), in accordance
with _Section 1.10_ and _Section 1.11_ , to each Common Stockholder entitled
to receive payments under _Section 1.02(d)_ or _Section 1.03_ its Pro Rata
Share of such balance; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or any
of its Affiliates have any liability or obligation pursuant to this _Section
1.07_ to make or cause to be made any payment in excess of
$3,000,000. Furthermore, if the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration exceeds
the Closing Aggregate Merger Consideration, the Stockholder
Representative and Parent will promptly (but in any event within three
Business Days) deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to
release to the Exchange Agent the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account for
the benefit of the Common Stockholders. Upon receipt of such funds from the
Escrow Agent, the Exchange Agent will distribute (and Parent will direct the
Exchange Agent to so distribute) to each Common Stockholder entitled to
receive payments under _Section 1.02(d)_ or _Section 1.03_ its Pro Rata
Share of such amount in accordance with _Section 1.10_ and _Section 1.11_.

  



  

(f) If the Closing Aggregate Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Aggregate
Merger Consideration, Parent and the Stockholder Representative will promptly
(but in any event within three Business Days) deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the
Adjustment Escrow Account the amount equal to such difference, or if such
difference is greater than the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account, the
total amount of the Adjustment Escrow Account (the " _Return Amount_ ") by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated in writing by Parent to the Stockholder Representative. The
Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative will not have any
liability for any amounts due pursuant to this _Section 1.07_ except to the
extent of the funds available in the Adjustment Escrow Account. If any funds
remain in the Adjustment Escrow Account after releasing the Return Amount to
Parent, the Stockholder Representative and Parent will, simultaneously with
the delivery of the instructions described in the first sentence of this
_Section 1.07(f)_ , deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
release to the Exchange Agent such remaining funds for the benefit of the
Common Stockholders. Upon receipt of such funds from the Escrow Agent, the
Exchange Agent will distribute (and Parent will direct the Exchange Agent to
so distribute) to each Common Stockholder entitled to receive payments under
_Section 1.02(d)_ or _Section 1.03_ its Pro Rata Share of such amount in
accordance with _Section 1.10_ and _Section 1.11_.

  



  

   

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.08.   _Escrow Account_. Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent
will deliver $3,000,000 (such amount, the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") in
immediately available funds into an escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow
Account_ "), such account to be established and maintained by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement
substantially in the form of _Exhibit G_ attached hereto, to be entered into
on the Closing Date by Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow
Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account
will serve as the sole and exclusive source of payment of any amount payable
to Parent under _Section 1.07_. All fees, costs and expenses of the Escrow
Agent will be paid by Parent.

  



  

1.09.   _Dissenting Shares_. If applicable, and to the extent available
under Section 262 of the DGCL, any share of capital stock of the Company that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is
held by a Stockholder who did not consent to or vote (by a valid and
enforceable proxy or otherwise) in favor of the approval of this Agreement,
which Stockholder complies with all of the provisions of the DGCL relevant to
the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights (such share being a "
_Dissenting Share_ ," and such Stockholder being a " _Dissenting Stockholder_
"), will not be converted into the right to receive the consideration to
which the Dissenting Stockholder would be entitled pursuant to _Section
1.02_, but rather will be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder fails
to perfect such Stockholder's dissenters' rights under the DGCL or
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon automatically be
converted into the right to receive the consideration referred to in _Section
1.02_, subject to the payment procedures set forth in _Section 1.10 _and
_Section 1.11_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of a
stockholder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will cease. The Company will not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal with
respect to any Dissenting Shares without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent may or may not be given in the sole and absolute discretion of
Parent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the Drag-Along Notice,
each Stockholder is required to waive any dissenters' rights, appraisal
rights or similar rights that such Stockholder may have in connection with the
Merger.

  



  

   

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.10.   _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein
to the contrary, Parent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of Tax Law. If Parent so withholds amounts, such amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
such Person in respect of such deduction and withholding. At least
five Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent will (a) notify the
Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders of any
anticipated withholding, (b) consult with the Stockholder Representative in
good faith to determine whether such deduction and withholding is required
under applicable Tax Law and (c) cooperate with the Stockholder Representative
and the Stockholders to minimize the amount of any applicable withholding.

  



  

1.11.   _Payment Methodology_.

  



  

(a) The Parties recognize that amounts payable under this _Article I_, from
funds released from the Adjustment Escrow Accounts or pursuant to _Section
6.07_ to any Employee Restricted Stockholder with respect to his or her shares
of Restricted Stock for which an election under Section 83(b) of the Code has
not been filed (including distributions of any portion of the
Reimbursement Fund Amount) (collectively, " _Employee Restricted Stock
Proceeds_ ") may be subject to withholding, other payroll deductions and,
solely with respect to the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration, amounts to be held back in respect of indebtedness of such
Employee Restricted Stockholder due to the Company as of the
Closing. Accordingly, to facilitate such payments, the Exchange Agent will
promptly deliver to the Surviving Company any Employee Restricted Stock
Proceeds (and an amount equal to the employer's share of Taxes applicable to
payment thereof), a listing of the Employee Restricted Stockholders who are to
receive a portion of such Employee Restricted Stockholders Proceeds and the
pre-withholding amounts due to each (each, an " _Employee Restricted Stock
Proceeds Request Notice_ "). Upon receipt of an Employee Restricted Stock
Proceeds Request Notice and the related Employee Restricted Stock Proceeds,
the Surviving Company will make, on the next regular payroll date (but in any
event within three Business Days of the Closing with respect to payments of
the Per Common Share Closing Cash Consideration and the Per Common Share
Parent Stock Consideration), the payments requested in such notice through
the Surviving Company's payroll system or cause such requested payments to be
made through the payroll system of the Group Company that employs each such
Person. Payments made to Employee Restricted Stockholders in accordance with
the foregoing will be net of withholding, other normal payroll deductions and,
solely with respect to the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration, the
amount of indebtedness of such Employee Restricted Stockholder due to the
Company as of the Closing in satisfaction of such indebtedness.

  



  

(b) Any Common Stock Merger Consideration that is payable to a Restricted
Stockholder that is not an Employee Restricted Stockholder in respect of
shares of Restricted Stock or to an Employee Restricted Stockholder in respect
to shares of Restricted Stock for which an election under Section 83(b) of
the Code has been filed will be paid directly to such holder (to the account
and pursuant to the wire transfer instructions specified by such Restricted
Stockholder in its Letter of Transmittal) by the Exchange Agent at each time
any such amount becomes payable (and Parent will direct the Exchange Agent to
make such payment).

  



  

   

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Except as provided in _Section 1.11(a)_ or _(b)_ , Common Stock Merger
Consideration or amounts payable pursuant to _Section 6.07_ that become
payable to a Stockholder will be paid directly to such holder (to the account
and pursuant to the wire transfer instructions specified by such holder in
its Letter of Transmittal) by the Exchange Agent at each time any such amount
becomes payable (and Parent will direct the Exchange Agent to make such

since its inception and all responses to such comment letters filed by or on
behalf of Parent are publicly available on the SEC\'s EDGAR website.

  



  

(f) To Parent's Knowledge, since July 22, 2015, each director and executive
officer of Parent has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all statements
required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

  



  

(g) Since July 22, 2015, Parent has timely filed and made available to the
Company all certifications and statements required by (x) Rule 13a-14 or Rule
15d-14 under the Exchange Act or (y) 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 (Section 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) with respect to any Parent SEC Report (the "
_Parent Certifications_ "). Each of the Parent Certifications is true and
correct. Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information concerning
Parent is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of Parent's SEC filings and other public disclosure documents. As
used in this _Section 4.06_, the term "file" shall be broadly construed to
include any manner in which a document or information is furnished, supplied
or otherwise made available to the SEC.

  



  

(h) Parent maintains and will continue to maintain a standard system of
accounting established and administered in accordance with GAAP. Parent has
designed and maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP. Parent maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability,
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

(i) All non-audit services were approved by the audit committee of the board
of directors and committees of Parent. Parent has no off-balance sheet
arrangements.

  



  

(j) Neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any manager, director,
officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Parent has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that Parent has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices. No attorney representing Parent, whether or not employed
by Parent, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the board of directors of Parent
(or any committee thereof) or to any director or officer of Parent. Since
Parent's inception, there have been no internal investigations regarding
accounting or revenue recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at
the direction of the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, general
counsel, the board of directors of Parent or any committee thereof.

or possible commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of
any applicable Law. Neither Parent nor any officer, employee, contractor,
subcontractor or agent of Parent has discharged, demoted, suspended,
threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated against an employee
of Parent in the terms and conditions of employment because of any act of
such employee described in 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a).

  



  

(l) All accounts payable of Parent reflected on the Parent Balance Sheet or
arising thereafter are the result of bona fide transactions in the ordinary
course of business. Since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet, Parent has not
altered in any material respects its practices for the payment of such
accounts payable, including the timing of such payment.

  



  

4.07.   _Parent Trust Amount_. As of the day immediately preceding the
date hereof, the Parent Trust has a rounded-off balance of $199,654,000 (the
" _Parent Trust Amount_ "), such monies invested in United States Government
securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act and held in trust by Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company pursuant to the Parent Trust Agreement. The
Parent Trust Agreement is valid and in full force and effect and enforceable
in accordance with its terms and has not been amended or modified. There are
no separate agreements, side letters or other agreements or understandings
(whether written or unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the
description of the Parent Trust Agreement in the Parent SEC Reports to be
inaccurate in any material respect and/or that would entitle any Person
(other than the underwriters of Parent's initial public offering for
deferred underwriting commissions as described in the Parent SEC Reports and
stockholders of Parent holding shares of Parent Common Stock sold in Parent's
initial public offering who shall have elected to redeem their shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Parent's certificate of incorporation, as
amended) to any portion of the proceeds in the Parent Trust. Prior to the
Closing, none of the funds held in the Parent Trust may be released except
(x) to pay income and franchise taxes or for working capital purposes from
any interest income earned in the Parent Trust and (y) to redeem shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of Parent's certificate
of incorporation, as amended, as described in the Parent SEC Reports (the "
_Permitted Releases_ "). At the Closing, all of the funds remaining in the
Parent Trust after accounting for the Permitted Releases may and shall be
released and used to make the payments contemplated by _Sections 1.02_ ,
_1.03_ and _1.08_.

4.08.   _Brokerage_. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports or
with respect to UBS Securities LLC, there are no claims for brokerage
commissions, finders' fees or similar compensation in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on any agreement made by or
on behalf of Parent or the Merger Sub.

  



  

4.09.   _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company (a) a true and
complete copy of each of the commitment letters, dated as of the date hereof,
between (i) Merger Sub and GSO Capital Partners, LP and (ii) Merger Sub and
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a copy of each of which is attached hereto as
_Exhibit H_ (in redacted form removing only the fee amounts) (collectively,
the " _Debt Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which the lenders and other
Persons party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, to provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts set forth
therein for the purpose, among others, of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and related fees and expenses to be incurred by
Parent and the Merger Sub in connection therewith and for the other purposes
set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, the Debt
Financing Commitment has not been amended or modified, no such amendment or
modification is pending or contemplated (except for amendments to add
additional financing sources thereto) and the Debt Financing Commitment has
not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. Parent has fully
paid or caused to be fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required to be paid in connection with the Debt Financing Commitment that are
payable on or prior to the date hereof. The Debt Financing Commitment is in
full force and effect as of the date hereof. The Debt Financing Commitment, in
the form so delivered, is a valid, legal, binding and enforceable obligation
of Parent and the other parties thereto, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Legal
Requirements relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or by
equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought at law or in
equity). Assuming the accuracy of the Company's representations and
warranties hereunder, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent or the Merger Sub or to the knowledge of Parent,
any other parties thereto, under the Debt Financing Commitment, or a failure
of any condition to the Debt Financing or otherwise result in any portion of
the Debt Financing being unavailable on the Closing Date. Assuming the
accuracy of the Company's representations and warranties hereunder, Parent
does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing will fail to timely be satisfied or that the full amount of the
Debt Financing will be unavailable on the Closing Date. The Debt Financing
Commitment is not subject to any conditions precedent to the obligations of
the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the Debt Financing
available to Parent and the Merger Sub at the Closing other than as set forth
therein (including the payment of customary fees). There are no side letters
or other agreements, contracts or arrangements to which Parent or the Merger
Sub or any of their Affiliates is a party which are related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than
as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment. Assuming the Debt
Financing is funded pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment and the Final
Parent Trust Amount (together with the aggregate amount of net proceeds, if
any, received by Parent from the issuance, sale and delivery of any of its
equity securities or any securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for any of its equity securities pursuant to _Section 7.05_ or
otherwise approved by the Company thereunder) is at least $199,599,000 less
the Company Proxy Expenses, Parent and the Merger Sub will have at the
Closing funds sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided
by Parent and/or the Merger Sub for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the Minimum Cash Amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each party hereto
agrees that a breach of this representation and warranty will not result in
the failure of a condition precedent hereunder, if (notwithstanding such
breach) Parent (i) is willing and able to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date and (ii) has funds
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby at the Closing.

securities or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for any of its equity securities pursuant to _Section 7.05_ or otherwise
approved by the Company thereunder) is at least $199,599,000 less the Company
Proxy Expenses, will have available to it at the Closing the financial
capability and adequate unrestricted cash on hand necessary and sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to satisfy
Parent's other monetary and other obligations contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.13.   _Parent Information_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or any of its Affiliates expressly for inclusion in the
Parent SEC Reports, mailings to Parent's shareholders with respect to the
Offer and/or the Merger, any supplements thereto and/or in any other document
filed with any Governmental Entity in connection herewith (including the
Offer Documents), will, at the date of filing and/or mailing, as the case may
be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading (subject to the

to any intention by the SEC to deregister the Parent Common Stock. As of the
date hereof, there is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or
Merger Sub, threatened in writing against Parent by Nasdaq with respect to
any intention by Nasdaq to prohibit or terminate the listing of Parent Common
Stock on Nasdaq. Parent has taken no action that is designed to terminate the
registration of Parent Common Stock under the Exchange Act.

  



  

4.15.   _Fairness Opinion_. Parent has received an opinion from UBS
Securities LLC addressed to the Board of Directors of Parent that the
consideration to be paid by Parent for the Company is fair, from a financial
point of view, to Parent (the " _Fairness Opinion_ "). Parent has obtained
the authorization of UBS Securities LLC to include a copy of the Fairness
Opinion in the Proxy Statement.

5.02.   _Access to Books and Records_. Subject to _Section 6.04_, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, the Company will provide Parent and its authorized
representatives reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Parent 's
Representatives_") with reasonable access during normal business hours, and
upon reasonable notice, to the offices, properties, senior personnel, and all
financial books and records (including Tax records) of the Group Companies in
order for Parent to have the opportunity to make such investigation as it will
reasonably desire in connection with the consummation of the transactions

business of any Group Company and (b) the Company may elect to limit, or cause
any Group Company to limit, disclosure of any information to certain Persons
designated in writing as a "clean team" by Parent (which Persons must be

the extent that it would require any Group Company to disclose information
subject to attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product privilege,
conflict with any third-party confidentiality obligations to which any Group
Company is bound, or violate any applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, no access or examination provided pursuant

warranty set forth herein or the conditions to the Closing set forth in
_Section 8.01(a)_. Parent will indemnify and hold harmless the Group
Companies from and against any Losses that may be incurred by any of them
arising out of or related to the use, storage or handling of (i) any

Law (including privacy Laws) or Contract and to which Parent or the
Parent's Representatives are afforded access pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Parent acknowledges that Parent is and remains bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and United Subcontractors, Inc. dated

herein provided, from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not a
waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in _Section 8.02_); _provided_ ,
__ that such efforts will not require agreeing to any obligations or
accommodations (financial or otherwise) binding on a Group Company in the
event the Closing does not occur. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ will limit, expand or otherwise
modify in any way any efforts standard explicitly applicable to any of the
Company's obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

5.04.   _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date hereof
through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor the Stockholder Representative will take any action to knowingly

Representatives) concerning any purchase of a majority of the outstanding
Common Stock or any merger, sale of substantially all of the assets of the
Group Companies or similar transactions involving the Group Companies (other
than assets sold in the Ordinary Course of Business) (each such transaction,
an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "); _provided_ that this _Section 5.04_
will not apply to the Company or the Stockholder Representative in connection
with Stockholder communications related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, cease
and cause to be terminated (a) any existing discussions, communications or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and the Parent's
Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Transaction and (b) any such Person's and its authorized

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5.05.   _Payoff Letters and Lien Releases_. At least five Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing, the Company will deliver to Parent a
customary payoff letter or letters (collectively, the " _Payoff Letter_ ")
executed by the lenders of the Indebtedness described in clause (a) below,
which letter will set forth (a) the total amount required to be paid at
the Effective Time to satisfy in full the repayment of all Indebtedness
outstanding under the Credit Agreement and, if any, all prepayment penalties,
premiums and breakage costs that become payable upon such repayment (the "
_Payoff Amount_ "), (b) the lenders' obligation to release all liens and
other security securing the Indebtedness described in clause (a) in due
course and at Parent's expense after receiving the Payoff Amount, and (c)
wire transfer instructions for paying the Payoff Amount.

execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to Parent
the certified copies of resolutions of the requisite stockholders of the
Company signed by Common Stockholders holding at least 66% of the shares of
Common Stock outstanding as of the record date and approving the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with the DGCL and the Organizational Documents in the form of  _Exhibit I_
hereto (the " _Written Stockholder Consent_ "). The Drag-Along Notice shall be
provided to each Common Stockholder who has not so signed the Written
Stockholder Consent within 10 days following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement.

  



  

5.07.   _Notification_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement and the Closing Date, if after the date hereof
the Company becomes aware of any fact or condition arising after the date
hereof that constitutes a breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Company in _Article III_ or of any covenant that would cause the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_ or _Section 8.01(b)_, as
applicable, not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date, the Company will
disclose in writing to Parent such breach. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, unless Parent provides the Company with a
termination notice within ten (10) days after disclosure of such breach by the
Company (which termination notice may be delivered only if Parent is entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)_), Parent will be
deemed to have waived its right to terminate this Agreement or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(a)_ or _Section 8.01(b)_.

  



  

5.08.   _Section 280G Approval_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain waivers
(the " _Waivers of Parachute Payments_ ") from each Person who has a right to
any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would be deemed to
constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and as to which such Person waives his or her rights to some or all of
such payments and/or benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") applicable to
such Person so that no remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to such
Person will be deemed to be "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code), and (b) no sooner than the day after the day all
the Waivers of Parachute Payments with respect to which the approval of
payments and/or benefits by the Company stockholders is to be solicited
become effective, solicit the approval of the stockholders of the Company to
the extent and in the manner required under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
of any Waived 280G Benefits. Prior to soliciting such waivers and approvals,
the Company will provide the final drafts of such waivers and such
stockholder approval materials to Parent for Parent's review and comment, and
the Company will consider reasonable comments of Parent thereon and consult
with the Parent with respect thereto, in each case in good faith,
including timely providing any material supporting information, calculations
and documents. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Parent
evidence that a vote of the stockholders of the Company was solicited in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.08_. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company will not be required to conduct a stockholder
vote pursuant to this _Section 5.08_ unless it is able to obtain Waivers of
Parachute Payments.

5.09.   _Financing_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until Closing, the Company will, and will cause each
of the Group Companies to, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause its and their respective representatives to, provide to Parent and
the Merger Sub such customary cooperation as may be reasonably requested by
Parent and the Merger Sub to assist them in causing the conditions in the Debt

ARTICLE VI. 
  
 COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE MERGER SUB

  



  

6.01.   _Access to Books and Records_. For a period of six and one-half
years from and after the Closing Date, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Company to, provide the Stockholder Representative and its
authorized representatives with access (for the purpose of examining and
copying) in connection with general business purposes, during normal business
hours, upon reasonable notice, to the books and records of the Group
Companies with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing
Date, including with respect to any Tax audits, Tax Returns, insurance
claims, governmental investigations, legal compliance, financial statement
preparation or any other matter. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by
the Stockholder Representative, Parent will not, and will not permit the
Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries to, for a period of six and one-half
following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the
books and records of any Group Company for any period prior to the
Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior notice to the Stockholder
Representative and offering to surrender to the Stockholder Representative
such books and records or any portion thereof that Parent or the Surviving
Company may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

  



  

6.02.   _Notification_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement and the Closing Date, if after the date hereof
Parent has knowledge of any fact or condition that constitutes a breach of any
representation or warranty made in _Article IV_ or any covenant that would
cause the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section
8.02(b)_, as applicable, not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date, Parent
will disclose in writing to the Company such breach. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, unless the Company provides
Parent with a termination notice within five days after disclosure of such
breach by Parent (which termination notice may be delivered only if the
Company is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)_), the Company will be deemed to have waived its right to terminate
this Agreement or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.02(a) _or _Section 8.02(b)_.

  



  

6.03.   _Efforts to Consummate_. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, Parent and the Merger Sub will use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the satisfaction,
but not waiver, of the Closing conditions set forth in _Article VIII_). The
Parties acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this _Section 6.03_
will limit, expand or otherwise modify in any way any efforts standard
explicitly applicable to any of Parent's and/or the Merger Sub's respective
obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

6.04.   _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Parent and the Merger
Sub each hereby agrees that from the date hereof until the Closing Date or
the earlier termination of this Agreement, it is not authorized to, and will
not (and will not permit any of its representatives or Affiliates to) contact
or communicate with the employees, customers, providers, service providers or
suppliers of any Group Company without the prior consultation with and
written approval of an executive officer of the Company or the
Stockholder Representative (such approval as may be provided via email);
_provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 6.04_ will not prohibit any
contacts by Parent or the Parent's Representatives with the customers,
providers, service providers and suppliers of any Group Company in the
Ordinary Course of Business and unrelated to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

   

 | 43| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.05.   _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and the Merger Sub will use its commercially reasonable
efforts, and will cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts
to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Debt
Financing or any Substitute Financing as promptly as possible following the
date hereof. Such commercially reasonable efforts will include taking the
following actions: (i) complying with all obligations under, and maintaining
in effect, the Debt Financing Commitment, (ii) using its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment, (iii)
using its commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing, including the terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any
related flex provisions) so that such agreements are in effect no later than
the Closing, (iv) using its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce its
rights under the Debt Financing Commitments, and (v) using its commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy all the conditions to the Debt Financing and the
definitive agreements related thereto that are within its control. In the
event that all conditions to the Debt Financing Commitment have been
satisfied or waived (other than the consummation of the Merger) or, upon
funding will be satisfied, and satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's and
the Merger Sub's obligations hereunder, each of Parent, the Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Financing Sources to fund on the Closing Date the Debt
Financing, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Merger
Sub will, as promptly as practicable after obtaining knowledge thereof, give
the Company and the Stockholder Representative written notice of any (A)
breach, default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
breach or default), termination or repudiation by a Financing Source or any
party to any definitive document related to the Debt Financing, (B) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any definitive
documents related to the obligations of the parties to the Debt Financing
Commitment to fund the Debt Financing, (C) receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any Financing Source with respect to any
actual or threatened termination of the Debt Financing by the Financing
Sources, (D) amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Debt
Financing Commitment (other than the exercise of certain flex provisions
therein), or (E) change, circumstance or event, in each case which causes
Parent and the Merger Sub to believe that they will not be able to timely
obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner
or from the Financing Sources or sources contemplated by the definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing. Upon request, Parent and the Merger
Sub will keep the Company and the Stockholder Representative informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of their efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, including by
providing copies of all definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing
and all information reasonably requested by the Company and the Stockholder
Representative and available to Parent and the Merger Sub relating to any
circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. Neither
Parent or the Merger Sub nor their respective Affiliates will amend, modify,
terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Debt Financing Commitment
(other than with respect to the exercise of certain flex provisions therein)
without the prior written approval of the Company, in each case that would (w)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, (x) impose new or
additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to funding the Debt Financing, (y) reasonably be expected to (1)
delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date or
(2) adversely impact the ability of Parent and the Merger Sub to enforce
their rights against the Persons providing the Debt Financing or any other
parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto, or (z) make it less likely that the Financing would be funded
(including by making the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less
likely to occur) or otherwise prevent or delay or impair the ability or
likelihood of Parent and the Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or adversely affect the ability of Parent and the Merger
Sub to enforce their rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitment relative to the ability of Parent and the Merger Sub to enforce
their rights against such other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment as
in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that Parent and the Merger Sub may
modify, supplement or amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have
not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof. In the
event that new commitment letters are entered into in accordance with any
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt
Financing Commitment permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.05_, such new
commitment letters will be deemed to be a part of the "Debt Financing" and
deemed to be the "Debt Financing Commitment" for all purposes of this
Agreement. Until the Closing, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing if Parent obtains actual knowledge of any fact, change, condition,
circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event that would result or
reasonably be likely to result in all or a material portion of the Debt
Financing not being available to Parent at Closing. In the event that,
notwithstanding the use of Parent's commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy
its obligations under this _Section 6.05_, funds in the amounts set forth in
the Debt Financing Commitment, or any portion thereof, become unavailable, or
if Parent and the Merger Sub reasonably determine that such funds may become
unavailable to them on the terms and conditions set forth therein, Parent and
the Merger Sub will (a) notify the Company and the Stockholder
Representative in writing thereof, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain substitute financing on terms (including structure, covenants and
pricing) not materially less beneficial to Parent and the Merger Sub with
lenders reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Merger Sub (that does not
impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify
conditions precedent to funding in a manner, when considered with the other
conditions taken as a whole, that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the ability or likelihood of Parent and the Merger Sub to consummate
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement) sufficient to enable Parent
and the Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with its terms (the " _Substitute Financing_ ") and (c) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter
that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution
thereof, deliver to the Company and the Stockholder Representative
true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter (in redacted
form removing only the fee information). Upon obtaining any commitment for
any such Substitute Financing, such financing will be deemed to be a part of
the "Debt Financing" and any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing
will be deemed the "Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 44| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent and the Merger Sub will pay, or cause to be paid, as the same will
become due and payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and
payable under the Debt Financing Commitment.

  



  

6.06.   _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) All employees of the Group Companies as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall continue as employees of the Group Companies as of the
Effective Time. Any such employee who remains employed by a Group Company or
any Affiliate of Parent for any time thereafter shall be a " _Company
Employee_ ". For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing
thereafter for twelve (12) months, Parent shall provide, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, Company Employees with compensation (including an
annual cash bonus opportunity) and employee benefits that in the aggregate are
substantially comparable to the compensation (including an annual cash bonus
opportunity) and employee benefits provided to each such Company Employee by
the Group Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of the foregoing, equity and equity-
based compensation provided by any Group Company to any Company Employee
shall not be taken into account and Parent shall have no obligation to
provide equity or equity-based compensation to any Company Employee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall be deemed to amend
any Company Employee Benefit Plan or limit, in any respect, the right of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) to ( _A_ )
terminate the employment of any Company Employee at any time for any or no
reason, ( _B_ ) change or modify the terms or conditions of employment for
any Company Employee (including location of performance), ( _C_ ) change or
modify any employee benefit plan or arrangement in accordance with their
terms or (D) increase the compensation (including an annual cash bonus
opportunity) and employee benefits from those provided to any such Company
Employee by the Group Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Parent, the Company and their
respective Affiliates in which Company Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing (the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with the same amount of service as was credited by
the Group Companies as of the Closing under similar or comparable Company
Benefit Plans (including for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting,
benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits); _provided_ that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the
funding of any benefit. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, ( _i_ ) with respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the
Company Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing,
each Company Employee will immediately be eligible to participate in such New
Benefit Plans, without any waiting time, to the extent coverage under such
New Benefit Plans replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee was eligible to participate
immediately before such commencement of participation (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Benefit Plans_ ") and ( _ii_ ) for purposes of each
New Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be
waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the
extent any such exclusions or requirements were waived or were inapplicable
under any similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan. Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Benefit Plan ending
on the date such Company Employee's participation in the corresponding New
Benefit Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Benefit Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Benefit Plan.

  



  

   

 | 45| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) This Section 6.06 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.06, expressed
or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.06.
Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Section 6.06 will create
any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee,
director or consultant of any Group Company in respect of continued employment
(or resumed employment) or any other matter.

  



  

6.07.   _Specified Proceeding_.

  



  

(a) Parent acknowledges that the Specified Proceeding is pending and the
Company is pursuing, among other things, compensatory and punitive awards and
damages. The parties hereto agree that, except as expressly set forth in this
_Section 6.07_ , the monetary awards or damages which may result from the
conclusion, settlement or other resolution of the Specified Proceeding (that
are recovered by the Company or any Group Company or any successor or assign
thereof) shall be for the benefit of the Common Stockholders. In furtherance
of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the Stockholder Representative
shall have the sole right and responsibility, on behalf of the Common
Stockholders, to control, settle, compromise, prosecute and defend in any
manner (including the appointment and selection of counsel reasonably
acceptable to Parent, it being understood that Greenberg Traurig and Blackwell
Burke P.A. are acceptable to Parent) the Specified Proceeding at the sole
cost and expense of the Common Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
without the prior written consent of Parent, the Stockholder Representative
shall not (i) settle or compromise a Specified Proceeding or consent to the
entry of any Order with respect thereto which does not include an
unconditional, duly authorized, fully executed and acknowledged (by a duly
registered notary public) written release of the Surviving Company from all
liability in respect of such Specified Proceeding; (ii) settle or compromise
any Specified Proceeding if the settlement imposes equitable remedies or
other obligations on the Company or its Affiliates; (iii) settle or compromise
any Specified Proceeding if the result is to admit civil or criminal
liability or culpability on the part of the Surviving Company or its
Affiliates that gives rise to criminal liability with respect to any such
Person; or (iv) take any action in such capacity that would reasonably
be likely to adversely affect the business or operations of the Company in
any material respect without first obtaining the prior written consent of
Parent, such consent to be granted or denied in the Company's reasonable
discretion. Legal counsel selected by the Stockholder Representative pursuant
to this _Section 6.07(a)_ shall submit all bills and invoices directly to
the Stockholder Representative. If the Stockholder Representative chooses to
relinquish its right to prosecute the Specified Proceeding in accordance with
this _Section 6.07(a)_ , it shall provide prompt written notice to the Company
of that fact and shall do, or cause to be done, whatever is reasonably
necessary to ensure that Parent, or an agent of Parent's choosing, can
exert sole and exclusive control over the Specified Proceeding. During such
time as the Stockholder Representative is prosecuting the Specified
Proceeding in accordance with this _Section 6.07(a):_

  



       | (i)  | prior  to an Efforts Failure, neither Parent nor the
Company nor any of their Affiliates or representatives shall take any action 
with respect to the Specified Proceeding without the prior written consent of
the Stockholder Representative; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



       | (ii)  | the  Stockholder Representative and the Company will
enter into a customary common interest agreement for purposes of maintaining 
confidentiality and privileges with respect to the Specified Proceeding; 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (iii)  | the  Stockholder Representative shall keep the
Company reasonably apprised of material developments in the Specified
Proceeding  and shall as promptly as reasonably practicable provide the
Company if such request is made by the Company, with an opportunity  to
review all material correspondence, filings, and other material documents
related to the Specified Proceeding in advance  of filing such materials in
addition to providing the Company with copies of all material correspondence,
filings, and other  material documents related to the Specified Proceeding;
and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (iv)  | the  Stockholder Representative shall not make any
public announcements regarding the Specified Proceeding. 
---|---|--- 
  

(b) For purposes of this _Section 6.07_ , the Stockholder Representative
ceasing to use reasonable, good faith efforts to prosecute the Specified
Proceeding or failing to pay all fees, costs and expenses related to the
Specified Proceeding shall constitute an " _Efforts Failure_ "; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to pay any fees, costs or expenses related to
the Specified Proceeding as to which the Stockholder Representative disputes
in good faith some or all of the amounts in question shall not constitute an
Efforts Failure, it being understood that the Stockholder Representative shall
be fully responsible for (i) handling such dispute and all expenses incurred
in connection therewith regarding fees, costs and expenses and (ii) the
amount determined to be due with respect to the amounts that were in dispute.
If there is an Efforts Failure, the Company may, by providing written notice
to the Stockholder Representative, take over the prosecution of the Specified
Proceeding at the Company's cost and expense and be entitled to any and all
damages and costs awarded in the Specified Proceeding.

  



  

   

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If the Stockholder Representative elects not to pursue or litigate an
appeal of any final judgment regarding the Specified Proceeding, it shall
inform the Company of that at least twenty (20) Business Days prior the

and costs resulting from such appeal or the settlement or other resolution of
the Specified Proceeding.

  



  

(d) From and after the Closing, Parent shall provide, and cause its

unreasonably interfere with the duties of such employees or (B) shall the
Stockholder Representative or its Affiliates provide or agree to provide any
of the Company's employees remuneration for their assistance in connection
with, or based on the outcome of, the Specified Proceeding.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, from and after the
Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including,

(g) The Stockholder Representative shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Parent and its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses relating to any
and all claims that may be brought against Parent and its Affiliates by the

Date by the Parent and its Affiliates.

  



  

6.08.   _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

  



       | (i)  | The  Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be filed (taking into account any valid extensions) 
all income Tax Returns of the Group Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period which are due  after the Closing Date. All such
income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
applicable Group Company's  past practices, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (ii)  | To  the extent permitted by applicable Law, all
Transaction Deductions will be (A) treated as relating to the Pre-Closing
Tax  Period ending on or including the Closing Date, and (B) reflected on
applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns based on  the full amounts paid
by the Company. The Transaction Deductions will be treated as the first items
of deduction claimed by  the Group Companies for purposes of determining the
amount of Tax refunds attributable to the Transaction Deductions for
purposes  of _Section 6.08(b)_. The Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder
Representative, for the Stockholder Representative's  review a draft of any
income Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period prepared by the Parent
pursuant to _Section 6.08(a)(i) _ no later than twenty (20) days prior to the
applicable filing deadline of such Tax Returns (taking into account any
available  extensions). The Parent shall consider in good faith comments
provided by the Stockholder Representative within ten (10) days  of the
Stockholder Representative's receipt of such income Tax Return and shall
incorporate such comments to the extent  not inconsistent with the past
practices of the Group Companies (where applicable) and applicable Law. To the
extent the Transaction  Deduction benefits are not used in any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, they will be carried forward and will be treated as the first 
items of loss offsets for future years. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(b)  _Tax Refunds/Payments_. The Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders) shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes paid by the Group
Companies in Pre-Closing Tax Periods (a " _Pre-Closing Refund_ "). To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall not apply, credit or set-off
all or any portion of any Pre-Closing Refund against any other Taxes or
liabilities. The Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to distribute to the
Stockholder Representative the amount of any such refund within twenty (20)
days after receipt of such refund. The Stockholder Representative shall pay
such amounts to the Stockholders (as determined by the Stockholder
Representative) pursuant to reasonable payment arrangements to be made with
the Company.

  



  

   

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)  _Amended Tax Returns_. Following the filing of any income Tax Return
described in _Section 6.08(a)_ , the applicable Group Companies shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to file any amended Tax Returns or application
for Tax refunds (including in all cases any refund of Tax payments made by
the Group Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending as of or including
the Closing Date), or take such other steps that are reasonably necessary to
claim any Tax refund available with respect to the Transaction Deductions
reflected on such Tax Return, in each case as promptly as is reasonably
practicable. The Parent shall control the prosecution of any such Tax refund
claim; provided that the Parent shall (i) provide updates to the Stockholder
Representative on any actions taken by the Parent and at the Stockholder
Representative's reasonable written request, update the Stockholder
Representative regarding the status and progress of such claim for Tax
refund, and (ii) deliver to the Stockholder Representative copies of
the applicable Tax Returns (or portions thereof) reasonably related to the
determination of the amounts payable to pursuant to _Section 6.08(b)_ prior
to the filing of such Tax Returns for review and comment consistent with the
procedures in _Section 6.08(b)_. The Parent shall not agree to settle or
compromise any such claim for Tax refund without the prior consent of the
Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(d)  _Assistance and Cooperation_.

  



       | (i)  | The  Stockholder Representative and the Parent agree
to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly 
as practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and
assistance relating to the Group Companies as  is reasonably requested and
reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Returns, the preparation,
prosecution, defense  or conduct of any Tax dispute or audit and the
verification of any amounts due (or withheld) pursuant to this _Section 6.08_. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (ii)  | The  Stockholder Representative and the Parent shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax dispute or 
audit involving or otherwise relating to the determination of the amount of
any refunds of Pre-Closing Taxes payable in respect  of the Transaction
Deductions, and to defend and assert the position that such Transaction
Deductions are deductible (to the  extent contemplated by this Agreement), in
the event that a Tax Return giving rise to such refunds has been audited or
disputed  prior to the payment thereof to the Parent by the applicable
Governmental Entity. With respect to any Tax dispute or audit  that could
reasonably be expected to impact a Pre-Closing Refund, Parent shall (1) keep
the Stockholder Representative informed  as to the progress of any Tax
dispute or audit in a timely manner, (2) promptly provide copies of all
correspondence or other  documents relating to such Tax dispute or audit to
the Stockholder Representative, (3) promptly provide notice of any scheduled 
meetings (whether telephonic or in person) with any Tax authority and permit
the Stockholder Representative, at the Stockholder  Representative \'s
expense, to attend and participate in such meetings and (4) allow the
Stockholder Representative to participate  in any other proceeding with
respect to such Tax dispute or audit at Stockholder Representative's own cost
and expense.  Any information obtained under this _Section 6.08(d)_ shall be
kept confidential, except as may be otherwise be required  under applicable
Law or necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the
conduct of any Tax dispute or audit. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | 50| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e)  _Tax Dispute Resolution_. In the event of any disagreement as to any Tax
matter covered in this _Section 6.08_ , the Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best
efforts to resolve such dispute. In the event any such disagreement cannot be
resolved between the Parent and the Stockholder Representative, such
disagreement shall be resolved by an accounting firm of international
reputation mutually agreeable to, and mutually retained by, Parent
and Stockholder Representative (the " _Tax Accountant_ "), and any such
determination by the Tax Accountant shall be final. The Tax Accountant shall
be instructed to resolve the dispute as soon as practicable, and in any event
within thirty (30) days of its engagement. The Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall instruct the Tax Accountant to only decide the
specific items under dispute by the parties. In resolving any dispute, the
Tax Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The Parent and the Stockholder
Representative agree to execute, if requested by the Tax Accountant, a
reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnification provisions
in favor of the Tax Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Tax Accountant
shall be borne equally by the Parent and the Stockholder Representative. If
the Tax Accountant does not resolve any differences between Parent and the
Seller with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Return at least three (3)
business days prior to the due date therefor, such Tax Return shall be filed
in a manner consistent with the position of Parent and, to the extent
necessary, amended to reflect the Tax Accountant\'s resolution.

  



  

(f)  _Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code or any other similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), the
Parent, Merger Sub, the Stockholders, the Company and their respective
Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under this _Section 6.08_ or
_Section 1.07 _ as an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes.

  



  

ARTICLE VII. 
  
 ACTIONS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING

  



  

The respective parties hereto covenant and agree to take the following

7.01.   _The Proxy_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall file with
the SEC a proxy statement relating to the Offer and the Merger (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and provide all of
its Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem up to 19,959,908 of
their shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Offering Shares_ "), to be
redeemed in conjunction with a stockholder vote on the Merger, all in
accordance with and as required by the applicable Governing Documents of
Parent (including, without limitation, the Prospectus and the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Company's bylaws) (the "
_Parent Governing Documents_ "), applicable law, and any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq.

  



  

   

 | 51| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in connection
with the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article X_.
Parent shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC, Nasdaq or the respective staff thereof
that is applicable to the Offer. Nothing in this _Section 7.01(b)_ shall (i)
impose any obligation on Parent to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date
(as the same may be extended in accordance with  _Section 13.22(c)_) or (ii)
be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of
Parent to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article X_.

  



  

(c) Without limitation, in the Proxy Statement, Parent shall (i) seek (A)
adoption and approval of this Agreement by the holders of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations,
including the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, (B) adoption and approval of
the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent,
(C) adoption and approval of an omnibus equity incentive plan, the form of
which is attached as _Exhibit J_ hereto (the " _Management Incentive Plan_
"), that provides for the granting of Parent Common Stock to employees of the
Company or certain Subsidiaries of the Company in the form of stock options,
restricted stock units, restricted stock or other equity-based awards, (D) to
elect, and designate the classes of, the members of the Board of Directors of
Parent, and (E) to obtain any and all other approvals necessary or advisable
to effect the consummation of the Merger, and (ii) file with the SEC
financial and other information about the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the applicable proxy solicitation rules set
forth in the Exchange Act (such Proxy Statement and the documents included
or referred to therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together
with any supplements, amendments and/or exhibits thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ "). Except with respect to the information provided by the Company
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and the other Offer Documents, Parent
shall ensure that, when filed, the Proxy Statement and the other Offer
Documents will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Parent shall cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated as promptly as practicable to holders of
shares of Parent Common Stock as and to the extent such dissemination is
required by United States federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder or otherwise (the " _Federal
Securities Laws_ "). The Company shall promptly provide to Parent such
information concerning the Company and the Stockholders as is either required
by the Federal Securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent for
inclusion in the Offer Documents. Subject to the Company's and the
Stockholders' compliance with the immediately preceding sentence with respect
to the information provided or to be provided by the Company or the
Stockholders for inclusion in the Offer Documents, Parent shall cause the
Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the
Federal Securities Laws. Parent shall provide copies of the proposed forms of
the Offer Documents (including any amendments or supplements thereto) to the
Company such that the Company and the Stockholder Representative are afforded
a reasonable amount of time prior to the dissemination or filing thereof to
review such material and comment thereon and Parent shall reasonably consider
in good faith any comments of such Persons. Parent and the Company shall
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents and promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
the Federal Securities Laws. Parent shall amend or supplement the Offer
Documents and cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of shares of Parent
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by the Federal
Securities Laws and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the applicable Parent Governing Documents. Parent shall provide the Company
the Stockholder Representative with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform them of any material oral comments, that Parent or any of its
Representatives receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give the
Company and the Stockholder Representative a reasonable opportunity under the
circumstances to review and comment on any proposed written or material oral
responses to such comments. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to "clear" comments from the SEC and its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents and to permit the Company and the Stockholder Representative to
participate with Parent or its Representatives in any discussions or meetings
with the SEC and its staff regarding the Offer Documents. The Company shall,
and shall cause each of the Group Companies to, make their respective
directors, officers and employees, upon reasonable advance notice,
reasonably available to Parent and its Representatives in connection with the
drafting of the public filings with respect to the Merger (including, without
limitation, the Offer Documents) and responding in a timely manner to comments
from the SEC or its staff.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent, or the Group Companies, or any of their respective subsidiaries,
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Offer Documents, so that such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify each other party hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of Parent.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement or any
Document, Parent may make any public filing with respect to the Merger to the
extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

7.02.   _Regulatory Filings_. Within twenty Business Days after the
date hereof, with respect to the Merger the parties hereto shall make, or
cause to be made, the filing required (if any) of each of them or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereto shall make, or cause to
be made, as promptly as practicable, all filings necessary to obtain all
Regulatory Approvals other than the HSR Approval. The parties hereto shall
use their reasonable best efforts to: (i) respond to any requests for
additional information made by any Governmental Entity; (ii) provide the
other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any filing,
submission, response to an information request or other (verbal or written)
communication to be submitted or made to any Governmental Entity and such
receiving party shall consider any such received comments in good faith;
(iii) advise the other party (and, where applicable, provide a copy) of any
written or verbal communications that it receives from any Governmental Entity
in respect of such filings (including in respect of any supplementary filings
or submissions) and otherwise in connection with satisfying the Regulatory
Approvals; (iv) provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
participate in any meetings with any Governmental Entity (subject to any
opposition by a Governmental Entity to a particular party\'s participation in
such meeting) and participate in, or review, any material communication
before it is made to any Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each party has the right to redact or otherwise exclude a party from
receiving any confidential competitively sensitive information required to be
shared under this _Section 7.02_, provided that such other party\'s external
counsel shall be entitled to receive such confidential competitively
sensitive information on an external counsel only basis. The parties hereto
shall: (i) not agree to an extension of any waiting period or review being
undertaken by a Governmental Entity without the other party\'s prior written
consent; (ii) cause any applicable waiting periods to terminate or expire at
the earliest possible date; and (iii) resist vigorously, at their respective
cost and expense, any order challenging the completion of the Merger or any
temporary or permanent injunction which could delay or prevent the Closing,
all to the end of expediting consummation of the Merger contemplated herein.
Without limiting the generality of Parent's undertaking pursuant to this
_Section 7.02_, Parent agrees to take any and all steps necessary to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or
trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any
other party so as to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible, including proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, order, hold
separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any of
its assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or
businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement as are required to
be divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit
or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying
or preventing the consummation of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement.
In addition, Parent shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would prevent the Closing. Any filing fee required in connection with seeking
the Regulatory Approvals shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Parent as a
Parent Transaction Expense and fifty percent (50%) by the Company as a Company
Transaction Expense.

  



    

  

7.03.   _Shareholder Vote; Recommendation of the Board of the Parent_.
The Board of Directors of Parent shall recommend that Parent's stockholders
vote in favor of adopting this Agreement and consummating the Merger, and
Parent shall, subject to the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
Parent, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Prior to the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article X_ , neither the
Board of Directors of Parent nor any committee or agent or
representative thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
the Company), or propose to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to the
Company), the Parent Board's recommendation in favor of this Agreement and the
Merger, (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Parent Acquisition Transaction,
(iii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or allow Parent to execute or enter into, any
agreement related to a Parent Acquisition Transaction, (iv) enter into any
agreement, letter of intent, or agreement in principle requiring Parent to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or breach its obligations hereunder, (v) fail to recommend against any Parent
Acquisition Transaction, (vi) fail to re-affirm the aforementioned Parent
Board recommendation at the written request of the Company within five (5)
Business Days or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.04.   _Listing_. From the date of this Agreement through the Closing,
Parent shall use all reasonable efforts that are necessary or desirable for
Parent to remain listed as a public company on, and for shares of Parent
Common Stock to be tradable over, the applicable Nasdaq market(s).

  



  

7.05.   _Operations of Parent Prior to the Closing_. Between the date
hereof and the Closing, and except (x) as contemplated by this Agreement, (y)
with the prior approval of the Company or (z) as set forth on _Schedule 7.05_
, Parent shall not take any of the following actions:

  



  

(a) make any amendment or modification to any of the Parent Governing
Documents;

  



  

(b) take any action in violation or contravention of any of the Parent
Governing Documents, applicable Law or any applicable rules and regulations

securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or options
with respect to, or warrants to purchase or rights to subscribe for, any of
its equity securities;

  



  

(d) make any redemption or purchase of its equity interests, except pursuant

Affiliates to contact) any customer, supplier, distributor, joint-venture
partner, lessor, lender or other material business relation of any Group
Company regarding any Group Company, its business or the Merger;

  



  

(i) amend, waive or terminate, in whole or in part, any Founder Voting
Agreement;

 | 54| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.06.   _Founder Voting Agreement_. Without limitation of Section 5.1
of the Founder Voting Agreement, Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that
the Company has the right to cause Parent to enforce Parent's rights and
perform Parent's obligations under the Founder Voting Agreement, and Parent
further acknowledges that money damages would not be an adequate remedy at
Law if any Founder Stockholder (as defined therein) fails to perform in any
material respect any of such Founder Stockholder's obligations under the
Founder Voting Agreement and accordingly, upon the written request of the
Company, Parent shall, in addition to any other remedy at Law or in equity,
seek an injunction or similar equitable relief restraining such Founder
Stockholder from committing or continuing any such breach or threatened
breach or to seek to compel specific performance of the obligations of any
other party under the Founder Voting Agreement, without the posting of any
bond, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Founder Voting
Agreement in any court of the United States or any State thereof having
jurisdiction, and if any action should be brought in equity to enforce any of
the provisions of the Founder Voting Agreement, Parent shall not raise the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at Law.

  



  

7.07.   _Founder Letter Agreement_. Parent shall enforce to the fullest
extent permitted by Law the restrictions on transfer of the 4,989,977 shares
of Parent Common Stock acquired by the Sponsor and other Parent insiders prior
to the consummation of the IPO (the " _Founder Common Stock_ ") as well as
the waiver of each of the Founder Stockholders' respective rights to redeem
such Founder Common Stock, in accordance with that certain letter agreement,
dated as of July 22, 2015, among Parent, the Sponsor and the individuals
party thereto.

  



  

7.08.   _No Claim Against Parent Trust_. The Company acknowledges that
it has read the Prospectus and that Parent has established the Parent Trust
from the proceeds of its initial public offering (" _IPO_ ") and from certain
private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO for the benefit of
Parent's public stockholders (" _Public Stockholders_ ") and certain parties
(including the underwriters of the IPO) and that, except for a portion of the
interest earned on the amounts held in the Parent Trust, Parent may disburse
monies from the Parent Trust only: (i) to the Public Stockholders in the event
they elect to redeem the Parent Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of Parent's initial business combination (as such term is used
in the Prospectus) (" _Business Combination_ "), (ii) to the Public
Stockholders if Parent fails to consummate a Business Combination within
twenty-four months from the closing of the IPO, (iii) any amounts necessary to
pay any Taxes and for working capital purposes or (iv) to, or on behalf of,
Parent after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination.
The Company hereby agrees that, it does not now and shall not at any time
hereafter have (other than its rights upon Closing) any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Parent Trust or
distributions therefrom, or make any claim prior to Closing against the
Parent Trust, regardless of whether such claim arises based on
contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all
such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Claims_ "). The
Company hereby irrevocably waives any Claims it may have, against the Parent
Trust (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a
result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with
Parent and will not, prior to the Closing, seek recourse against the Parent
Trust (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever
(including for an alleged breach of this Agreement). This _Section 7.08_
shall not limit or prohibit (i) the Company's right to pursue a claim against
Parent for legal relief against monies or other assets held outside the Parent
Trust or (ii) any claims that the Company may have in the future against
Parent's assets or funds that are not held in the Parent Trust (including any
funds that have been released from the Parent Trust to the Parent and any
assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds). For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
including the immediately preceding sentence, the waivers under this _Section
7.08_ will continue to apply at and after the Closing to distributions made
to redeeming Public Stockholders and for transaction expenses paid. The
Company agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to
this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Parent to induce it to enter
into this Agreement. This _Section 7.08_ shall not limit the Company's
right to seek specific performance against Parent pursuant to _Section
13.22_, including the right to seek specific performance against Parent to
require Parent to take such actions contemplated by this Agreement subject to
the satisfaction of Parent's conditions to the Closing in _Section 8.01_ ,
and to comply with the terms of the Parent Trust Agreement, including
distribution of funds from the Parent Trust upon the Closing in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 55| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.09.   _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date hereof
through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Parent will
not take any action to knowingly initiate, solicit or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, or knowingly provide any information to, any Person (other
than the Company and the Company's Representatives) concerning any alternative
business combination transaction involving Parent, including without
limitation, any purchase or sale of equity or assets of Parent or any other
Person or a merger, combination or recapitalization of Parent or any

_Section 8.01(a)_ or  _Section 8.01(b)_ from being satisfied at or prior to
the Outside Date; _provided_ _further_ that neither a breach by Parent of
_Section 4.12_ nor the failure to deliver the payments contemplated by

(provided that if such Party is Parent, neither Parent nor the Merger Sub will

to the Closing set forth in _Section 8.01_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing), (ii) the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the second

withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to the Company), the Parent Board's
recommendation in favor of this Agreement and the Merger, or fails to
reaffirm such recommendation as promptly as practicable (and in any event

duties under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any Loss, damage,
cost, Liability or expense incurred pursuant to _Section 6.07(g)_. Any

Share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the

the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any

that any of the restrictive covenants set forth in _Article V_, _Article
VI_ and _Article XI_ is unenforceable, it is the intent of the Parties that
the restrictive covenants be modified to be of the maximum duration,
geographic area, and scope that is deemed to be enforceable by the court, and
the Parties will inform any such court of such intent.

13.16.   _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or scanned pages via electronic mail, will be treated in

the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party hereto or to any
such contract, each other Party hereto or thereto will re-execute original
forms thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party hereto or to
any such contract will raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or contract was
transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or email as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such Party forever waives any
such defense. This Agreement is not binding unless and until signature pages

13.17.   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all
of which will constitute one agreement. Execution and delivery of this
Agreement by exchange of electronically transmitted counterparts bearing the
signature of a Party will be equally as effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of such Party.

  



  

13.18.   _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and Schedules hereto will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules or provisions (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

13.19.   _Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) Any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby will be brought and determined exclusively
in the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; ___provided_
 that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, any such
Legal Proceeding will be brought exclusively in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware or any other court of the State of
Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Legal Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in any such
court or that any such Legal Proceeding that is brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal Proceeding
may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party
agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in _Section 13.06_
will be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting _Section 13.19(a)_,
each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Legal
Proceeding, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the financing sources under the Debt Financing Commitment in any way
relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the debt commitment letters or any other letter or
agreement related to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than any State or Federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York, and any appellate court thereof and each
Party hereto (v) submits for itself and its property with respect to any
such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (w)
acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that service of process, summons, notice
or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective address
provided in _Section 13.06_ shall be effective service of process against
them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court; (x) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any
such court; (y) acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that a final judgment in
any such Legal Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law;
and (z) acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that any such Legal Proceeding
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state that
would result in the application of the laws of any other state.

13.20.   _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or
by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

13.21.   _No Vicarious Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, all liabilities and obligations arising out of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be limited to the
parties to this Agreement, and a Person that is not a party to this Agreement
will not have any liability or obligation hereunder or with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

13.22.   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) Each Party agrees that irreparable damage would occur and that the
Parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, in addition to any
other remedies available under this Agreement, the Parties agree that, prior
to the termination of this Agreement, each Party will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent the other Party's breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including
Parent's or the Company's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement if required to do so hereunder). Each Party
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives (i) any defenses in any Legal
Proceeding for an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief,
including the defense that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law
or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or equity and (ii) any requirement under Law to post a bond,
undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

(b) For purposes of clarification, the Company's specific performance rights
under _Section 13.22(a)_ to cause Parent to close the transactions
contemplated hereby when required to do so under the terms of this Agreement
will include the right to cause Parent to draw down the full proceeds of the
Debt Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Debt Financing
Commitment, including by requiring Parent to bring one or more lawsuits or
other appropriate Legal Proceeding against the debt providers under the
Debt Financing Commitment. In no event will the exercise of the Company's
right to seek specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to this
_Section 13.22_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the Company's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 10.01_ and _10.02_ and to be
reimbursed by Parent for the Company Proxy Expenses.

  



  

   

 | 88| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) To the extent any Party brings any Legal Proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to the Closing, the Outside Date will automatically be extended to (i)
the 20th Business Day after such Legal Proceeding is no longer pending or
(ii) such other date established by the court presiding over such Legal
Proceeding.

  



  

13.23.   _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Willkie Farr and Gallagher
LLP (" _WF andG_") has acted as legal counsel to certain of the Stockholders
and the Company, its and their Affiliates and the Group Companies prior to the
Closing, and that WFandG intends to act as legal counsel to certain of the
Stockholders after the Closing, each of Parent and the Surviving Company
(including on behalf of the Surviving Company's Subsidiaries) hereby waives,
on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts
that may arise in connection with WFandG's representing any Stockholder and/or
its Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent,
the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated herein. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client
confidences between any Stockholder and its Affiliates in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
such Stockholder and its Affiliates (and not to the Group Companies or the
Surviving Company). Accordingly, the Group Companies and the Surviving
Company, as the case may be, will not have access to any such communications,
or to the files of WFandG relating to engagement, whether or not the Closing
will have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon
and after the Closing, (a) the applicable Stockholder and its Affiliates (and
not the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries) will be the sole holders
of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries will be a holder thereof, (b) to
the extent that files of WFandG in respect of such engagement constitute
property of the client, only the applicable Stockholder and its
Affiliates (and not the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries) will
hold such property rights and (c) WFandG will have no duty whatsoever to reveal
or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between WFandG and any of the Group Companies or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries and a third party
(other than a Party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates)
after the Closing, the Surviving Company (including on behalf of its
Subsidiaries) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications by WFandG to such third party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Surviving Company nor any of its Subsidiaries may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Stockholders.

  



  

13.24.   _No Recourse_. Except in the case of fraud, all actions, claims,
obligations, liabilities or causes of actions (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to: (a) this Agreement,
(b) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to, this Agreement), (c) any breach of this Agreement and (d)
any failure of the Merger to be consummated, may be made only against (and,
without prejudice to the rights of any express third party beneficiary to
whom rights under this Agreement inure pursuant to _Section 13.13_), are
those solely of the Persons that are expressly identified as parties to this
Agreement and not against any Released Party. Except in the case of fraud, no
other Person, including any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, stockholder, optionholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of, or any financial advisor or lender to, any party to this
Agreement, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of, or
any financial advisor or lender (each of the foregoing, a " _Released Party_
") to any of the foregoing shall have any liabilities (whether in contract or
in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil) for any claims, causes of action, obligations or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any
manner to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (a) through (d) and
each Party, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably
releases and forever discharges each of the Released Parties from any such
liability or obligation.
