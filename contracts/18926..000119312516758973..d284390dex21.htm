"), among CENTURYLINK, INC., a Louisiana corporation (" _Parent_ "), WILDCAT
MERGER SUB 1 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect Wholly
Owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub 1_ "), WWG MERGER SUB LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and an indirect Wholly Owned Subsidiary of

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company and the
respective boards of managers of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 have each
approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub 1 with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the
Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ "), pursuant to which
each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("
_Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right
to receive a combination of cash and shares of common stock, par value $1.00
per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ");

WHEREAS, immediately following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will
then merge with and into Merger Sub 2 (the " _Subsequent Merger_ " and,
together with the Merger, the " _Combination_ ") in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA and upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company, and

to vote all shares of Company Common Stock it owns in accordance with the
terms of such voting agreement;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

THE COMBINATION

 

Section 1.1. _The Merger and the Subsequent Merger_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the DGCL and the DLLCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub 1 will merge with
and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub 1 shall cease.
The Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a Wholly Owned
Subsidiary of Parent and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the
State of Delaware (as such, the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). Immediately
after the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL and the DLLCA, the
Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Merger Sub 2, and the separate
existence of the Surviving Corporation shall cease. Merger Sub 2 shall
continue as the surviving limited liability company and as a Wholly Owned
Subsidiary of Parent and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the
State of Delaware (as such, the " _Surviving Company_ ").

 

Section 1.2. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1, the closing of the Combination
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place on the date that is the later of (i) the
third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable
law) of the conditions (other than those conditions that, by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by law, waiver of those conditions as of the Closing) set
forth in Article VIII and (ii) the final day of the Marketing Period or such
earlier date as may be specified by Parent on no less than three Business
DaysÂ’ prior written notice to the Company, unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the date of the Closing, the "
_Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, unless
another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

 

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on
the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall file a certificate of merger
relating to the Merger as contemplated by the DGCL and the DLLCA (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the " _Secretary of State_ "), in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with, the DGCL and the DLLCA. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State on the Closing Date, or at such other time as Parent and
the Company shall agree to and specify in the Certificate of Merger. As used
herein, the " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the time at which the Merger shall
become effective. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall file a certificate of merger relating to the
Subsequent Merger as contemplated by the DGCL and the DLLCA (the " _Subsequent
Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State, in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with, the DGCL and the DLLCA. The
Subsequent Merger shall become effective at such time as the Subsequent
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State on the
Closing Date or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Subsequent Certificate of Merger. As used herein, the "
_Subsequent Effective Time_ " shall mean the time at which the Subsequent
Merger shall become effective.

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Combination_. At the Effective Time, the effects
of the Merger and, at the Subsequent Effective Time, the effects of the
Combination, shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of
Merger, the Subsequent Certificate of Merger, and the applicable provisions of
the DGCL and the DLLCA.

 



- 2 \- Section 1.5. _Surviving Company Constituent Documents_.

 

(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable law, except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of
Merger Sub 2, as in effect immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement, respectively, of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law, except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 1.6. _Surviving Company Managers and Officers_. From and after the
Subsequent Effective Time, the managers of Merger Sub 2 in office immediately
prior to the Subsequent Effective Time shall be the initial managers of the
Surviving Company and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Subsequent Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Company and, in each case, shall hold office from the Subsequent Effective
Time until his or her respective successor is duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement of the Surviving Company or otherwise as provided by applicable law.

 

Section 1.7. _Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof:

 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into (A) 1.4286 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock, subject to Section 2.5 with
respect to fractional shares (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), and (B) the
right to receive $26.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_
" and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(ii) All shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares referred to in
Section 1.7(c)) shall cease to be issued and outstanding and shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a valid
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or
evidenced by way of book-entry in the register of stockholders of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Uncertificated Company Stock_ ")
shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock, except the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become
entitled, all in accordance with Article II.

 

(iii) Each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub 1 issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) At the Subsequent Effective Time, all limited liability company interests
of Merger Sub 2 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Subsequent
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist. At the
Subsequent Effective Time, each share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Subsequent Effective Time
shall be converted into one limited liability company interest of the
Surviving Company.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders that have properly perfected
their rights of appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting_

 



- 3 \-   _Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless and until such stockholders shall have failed to perfect
any available right of appraisal under applicable law, but, instead, the
holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such right of appraisal, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such
stockholder shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares for purposes of this
Agreement and shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into
the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with Section
1.7(a). The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served or delivered in
connection with such demands pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
and (B) the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands made pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (x)
make any payment with respect to any such demand, (y) offer to settle or
settle any such demand or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal
rights in accordance with the DGCL.

(d) If prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, should split, subdivide, consolidate, combine or otherwise reclassify the
Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend or
other stock distribution in Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as
applicable, or otherwise change the Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock into any other securities, or make any other such stock dividend or
distribution in capital stock of Parent or the Company in respect of the
Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, respectively, then any number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the price of the Parent Common
Stock or the number or fraction of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such split, combination, dividend or other distribution or change.

 

Section 1.8. _Treatment of Company RSU Awards_.

 

(a) _Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(i) (A) Each Company RSU Award granted prior to April 1, 2014, and (B) each
Company RSU Award granted to a non-employee member of the Board of Directors
of the Company, in each case, that is outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of such Company RSU
Award shall receive from Parent or the Surviving Company within
three Business Days following the Closing Date, the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock covered by such Company RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that any fractional
shares that would otherwise be issuable pursuant to this Section 1.8(a)(i)
shall be converted into cash in accordance with Section 2.5. Applicable Tax
withholdings with respect to the consideration payable pursuant to this
Section 1.8(a)(i) first shall reduce the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to this Section 1.8(a)(i), with the value of such
shares equal to the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the
Closing Date.

 

(ii) Each Company RSU Award granted on or after April 1, 2014 (other than any
Company RSU Award granted to a non-employee member of the Board of Directors
of the Company) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed and converted automatically into a restricted stock unit
award with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an "
_Adjusted RSU Award_ ") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio, provided, that any fractional shares shall be rounded
up to the nearest whole number. Each Adjusted RSU Award shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the Company RSU Award
under the Company Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder,
including vesting and settlement, provided, that, with respect to any Company
RSU Award that is subject to performance-vesting conditions, (I) for purposes

determined in good faith by the compensation committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ ") prior to

following the Effective Time, the Adjusted RSU Award shall continue to vest
based on continued service to Parent and its Subsidiaries (subject to any

Section 1.8(a)(ii), the actual level of performance for any Company RSU Award
that is subject to performance-vesting conditions shall be calculated in the

- 5 \- Section 2.2. _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
will send to each record holder of a Certificate or holder of shares of
Uncertificated Company Stock other than Certificates in respect of Dissenting
Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in a
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Company Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of a
Certificate, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated, book-entry form), and the amount of
cash (including amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and in respect
of any dividends or other distributions to which holders are entitled pursuant
to Section 2.3, if any), into which the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices.

(b) No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to
Section 1.8(a) or 2.3.

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, one or more shares of
Parent Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares
of Parent Common Stock, a check in the proper amount of cash pursuant to
Section 1.8(a) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3, may be issued with respect to such
Company Common Stock to such a transferee only if the Certificate representing
such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

 

Section 2.3. _Distributions with Respect to_ _Unexchanged_ _Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate. Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable
law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor,
without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and

distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such

of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Article I and this
Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.3) shall be deemed
to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock.

Section 2.5. _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates
or scrip representing less than one share of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional amount multiplied by the last reported sale price of Parent Common
Stock on the NYSE (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent
and the Company) on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the
Effective Time.

 



- 6 \- Section 2.6. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company or
otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Company, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company and Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) for the Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7 and any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.

 

Section 2.7. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the
Company, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to
the holders of Certificates immediately prior to such date on which the
Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permissible by applicable law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.8.  _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Any funds included in the
Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent;
provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s
Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall promptly be paid to Parent. Any loss of any of the funds
included in the Exchange Fund shall be for the account of Parent and shall not
alter ParentÂ’s obligation to pay the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.9. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate
or other documentation (including an indemnity in customary form) reasonably
requested by Parent, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby,
and any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.10. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company, Parent,
Merger Sub 1 and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the relevant taxing
authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

Section 2.11. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to execute
and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, Merger Sub 1 or Merger

in the name and on behalf of the Company, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Company any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the

presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted
into the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common

finderÂ’s or other fee or commission to any consultant, broker, finder or
investment banker in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub 1
or Merger Sub 2.

 

Section 4.22. _Financing_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the fully
executed Commitment Letter and the fully executed Fee Letter executed in
connection with the Financing (with only fee amounts, dates and certain other
economic terms, including in respect of the "market flex" and "securities
demand" provisions, redacted) (none of which would adversely affect the amount
or availability of the Financing other than through original issue discount).
As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and general
principles of equity). As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter and Fee
Letter have not been amended or modified in any respect and, to the Knowledge
of Parent, the commitments in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn
or terminated. There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter (as
such terms may be altered in accordance with the "market flex" provisions set
forth in the Fee Letter executed in connection with the Financing) other than
as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party
thereto under the Commitment Letter. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the Commitment Letter, as of the date hereof, assuming satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, the aggregate proceeds to
be disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
together with other financial resources of Parent, including its cash on hand
and marketable securities, and cash on hand of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient to fund the Cash
Consideration, the cash payable to holders of Company RSU Awards, pursuant to
Section 1.8, the payment of any debt required to be repaid, redeemed,
retired, canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in
connection with the Combination as of the date hereof (including all
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be repaid,
redeemed, retired, canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged
in connection with the Combination, including premiums and fees incurred in
connection therewith (the " _Required Indebtedness_ ")), and all other fees
and expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 in connection
with the Combination and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions set 

 



- 35 \-  forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if the Closing were to occur on the date
hereof, the incurrence of the indebtedness contemplated by the Commitment
Letter to be incurred on the Closing Date, including the liens and guarantees
provided in connection therewith as set forth in the Commitment Letter, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would not
result in a default or event of default under the Parent Existing Notes or
the indenture governing the Parent Existing Notes. As of the date hereof,
assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2,
Parent has no reason to believe that either it or any other party will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition of the Financing under the
Commitment Letter or any related Fee Letter or that the Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter will not be made available to Parent on the Closing
Date. As of the date of this Agreement, other than the Commitment Letter and
Fee Letter, there are no other letters, agreements or understandings (other
than customary non-disclosure agreements and diligence non-reliance letters)
between Parent, on the one hand, and the Financing Sources, on the other
hand, that could have an Adverse Effect on the Financing. Parent has fully
paid all fees and expenses and other amounts required to be paid on or prior
to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Commitment Letter.

have the right to use all items and equipment necessary to operate and
maintain the network of Parent and its Subsidiaries and such items and

defects, subject only to normal wear and tear, except for any of the foregoing
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 4.24. _State Takeover Statutes_. No "fair price", "moratorium",
"control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation or any anti-takeover provision in Parent Organizational Documents
is, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to the Combination or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

duly called and held, by unanimous vote (i) determined that this Agreement is
in the best interests of Parent and its shareholders, (ii) approved the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the holders of the shares of Parent Common Stock approve the

Section 4.25 (subject to the right of the Board of Directors of Parent to
withdraw, amend or modify such recommendation in accordance with Section
7.4).

collectively, the " _Required Parent Vote_ ") is the only vote or consent of
the holders of any class or series of ParentÂ’s capital stock necessary in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger.

(b) The United States government has not notified Parent or any of its

Section 6.2. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to, honor all Company Benefit Plans and compensation
arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing shall not prohibit Parent from amending or terminating
the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms. For

 



- 42 \-  the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on the one (1) year
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent agrees to provide each employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing
Company Employee_ "), while such Continuing Company Employee remains employed
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time,
the Company and its Subsidiaries), (i) with an annual base salary or wage rate
and annual cash incentive compensation opportunities that are, in each case,
no less favorable than the annual base salary or wage rate, as applicable,
and annual cash incentive opportunities provided to such Continuing Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) total incentive
compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than the total
incentive compensation opportunities (including both cash and equity
compensation opportunities and excluding any retention awards) provided to
such Continuing Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided that the mix of service-based and performance-based incentive
compensation will be consistent with the mix in 2016 and will ignore the fact
that service-based Company RSU Awards may be granted in lieu of performance-
based Company RSU Awards in 2017; and (iii) at ParentÂ’s election, either (A)
participation in employee benefit plans, programs and policies, including any
pension plan, defined benefit plan, defined contribution plan, bonus plan,
profit sharing plan, medical plan, dental plan, life insurance plan, time off
program and disability plan (excluding severance plans, programs and
policies), in each case to the same extent and on the same terms (for the
avoidance of doubt, including with respect to level of benefits) as similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, or (B) continued
participation in employee benefit plans, programs and policies, including any
pension plan, defined benefit plan, defined contribution plan, bonus plan,
profit sharing plan, medical plan, dental plan, life insurance plan, time off
program and disability plan (excluding severance plans, programs and
policies), that provide benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate
to the benefits provided to such Continuing Company Employee under the
Company Benefit Plans immediately before the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent agrees
that any Continuing Company Employee (other than Continuing Company Employees
in Latin America) whose employment is terminated (i) by Parent or the
Surviving Company without Cause (as defined in the severance plan or practice
set forth in Section 6.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule applicable to
such Continuing Company Employee), (ii) solely with respect to participants in
the Key Executive Severance Plan, by the Continuing Company Employee for Good
Reason (as defined in the Key Executive Severance Plan), or (iii) solely with
respect to Continuing Company Employees with a title of Vice President and
above who do not participate in the Key Executive Severance Plan, due to a
forced relocation of more than 50 miles, in each case, within the one (1)
year period commencing on the Effective Time, will be entitled to cash
severance benefits that are no less favorable, and welfare benefits that are
no less favorable in the aggregate, in each case than the cash severance
benefits and welfare benefits, respectively, determined in accordance with the
terms of (A) Key Executive Severance Plan (as in effect as of the date hereof)
for participants therein and (B) as set forth on Section 6.2(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule for any Continuing Company Employee not
covered by the Key Executive Severance Plan, subject to such employee
providing a timely and effective release of claims in favor of Parent, the
Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates to the extent not otherwise
required.

(c) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan in
which any Continuing Company Employee first becomes eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), each
Continuing Company Employee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
receive full credit for the years of continuous service by such Continuing
Company Employee recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan to the same extent as if it
were service with Parent for all purposes other than (i) benefit accrual
under defined benefit pension plans, (ii) where such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits, (iii) where such services were not recognized under
the corresponding Company Benefit Plan or no corresponding Company Benefit
Plan existed or (iv) for purposes of any benefit plan that is a frozen plan as
of the Effective Time or with respect to any benefits that are grandfathered
as of the Effective Time. With respect to any New Plan that is a welfare
benefit plan in which any Continuing Company Employee (or his or her eligible
dependents) first become eligible to participate on or after the Effective
Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, (A) cause to be
waived any eligibility

 



- 43 \-  requirements or pre-existing condition limitations except to the extent such
eligibility requirements or pre-existing conditions would apply under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan in which any such Continuing Company Employee
(and eligible dependents) was a participant or eligible to participate as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) give effect, in determining
any deductibles, co-insurance or maximum out of pocket limitations, to
amounts paid by such Continuing Company Employee (and eligible dependents)
prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan in which any such
Continuing Company Employee (or eligible dependent) was a participant as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent that such
credit was given under such Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time)
in satisfying such requirements during the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs.

 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of
control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans
will, for purposes of the Company Benefit Plans only, occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.

(e) Upon ParentÂ’s reasonable request from time to time (but up until the
sixty days prior to the anticipated date of the Effective Time no more
frequently than once per quarter, except where there is reasonable reason to
believe that there has been a material change to the calculations since
immediately prior request), the Company shall, a reasonable period of time
following receipt of such request (but in no event more than five (5) Business
Days following receipt of such request), provide Parent with the then-most
recent calculations and reasonable back-up information relating to Sections
280G and 4999 of the Code relating to the Merger, including any non-compete
valuations.

 

(f) Prior to making any broad-based communication or written communications
that would reasonably be interpreted to create a legally binding right to any
future compensation on the part of a Continuing Company Employee, in each
case, pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any schedules hereto),
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication,
Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any
such mutually agreeable communication.

(g) The Company shall provide to Parent at least five days advanced written
notice prior to hiring or firing any employee with a title of Vice President
or above; provided that, in the event of a termination for Cause, the Company
shall provide notice as promptly as practicable, whether before or after the
termination of employment.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 or any other provision of this
Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, including without
limitation, any Company Benefit Plan or any Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) shall
alter or limit the ability of any of Parent, the Surviving Company, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them in accordance with its terms, (iii) is intended
to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment, or (iv) is intended
to confer upon any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current
or former employee, director, officer or other service provider or any
participant in a Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement) any right as a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement.

Section 6.3. _Indemnification Continuation_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Section 6.3, (i) " _Indemnified Person_ " shall mean
any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time,
(x) an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y)
serving at the request of the Company as an officer or director of another
corporation, joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of any
partnership or a trustee of any trust, and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall mean
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 



- 44 \- (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to
provide indemnification to each Indemnified Person in connection with any
Proceeding based directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) on, or arising
directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) out of, the fact that such
Indemnified Person is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as an
officer or director of another corporation, joint venture or other enterprise
or general partner of any partnership or a trustee of any trust, whether
pertaining to any matter arising before or after the Effective Time. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, each Indemnified Person
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, suit or proceeding from Parent or the Surviving Company
within a reasonable period of time following receipt by Parent or the
Surviving Company from the Indemnified Person of a request therefor; provided
that an Indemnified Person shall repay Parent or the Surviving Company for any
expenses incurred by Parent or Surviving Company in connection with the
indemnification of such Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 6.3 if it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person did not meet the
standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by Parent or the Surviving
Company as set forth in the Company Organizational Documents. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to (i) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
CompanyÂ’s and any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ certificates of incorporation
and bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii)
comply with and not amend without the consent of the other parties thereto,
any indemnification contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of
their respective current or former directors, officers or employees as in
effect immediately prior to the date hereof. In the event that Parent (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.3, unless such assumption occurs by operation of
law.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving Company
shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the CompanyÂ’s
current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policies covering acts or
omissions occurring (or alleged to occur) prior to or at the Effective Time
with respect to Indemnified Persons; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.3(c)
more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by
the Company for such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Company would be required to
expend more than 300% of current annual premiums, the Surviving Company shall
obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual
premiums equal to 300% of current annual premiums. In lieu of the foregoing,
the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year "tail"
prepaid officersÂ’ and directorsÂ’ liability insurance policy in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such
Indemnified Person for an amount not to exceed 300% of current annual
premiums. If such "tail" policy has been established by the Company, Parent
shall not terminate such policy and shall cause all obligations of the Company
thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving Company.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.3 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger for a period of six years and are expressly intended to benefit each
of the Indemnified Persons; provided, however, that in the event that any
claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims.

 



- 45 \- (e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
in this Section 6.3 to the same extent and under the same conditions and
procedures (and subject to the same conditions, including with respect to the
advancement of expenses) as such Indemnified Person is entitled on the date
hereof under the Company Organizational Documents (or the corresponding
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company).

Section 6.4. _Notice of Breach_. From and after the date hereof and until the
earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article IX hereof, Parent shall promptly give written notice with
particularity upon having Knowledge of any matter that would constitute a
material breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant of
Parent contained in this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to cause
any condition to the obligations of any party hereto to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or that would
reasonably be expected to cause the Financing not to occur; provided, however,
that a failure to give notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be excluded
for purposes of the condition set forth in Section 8.3(b).

 

Section 6.5. _Maintenance of Parent Dividend_. From the date hereof until the
earlier to occur of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article IX hereof, Parent shall continue to pay regular quarterly
cash dividends in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock of $0.54 per share
of Parent Common Stock with declaration, record and payment dates
substantially consistent with those of the dividends paid by Parent during its
most recent fiscal year; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required
to comply with this Section 6.5 if, and only if, ParentÂ’s Board of Directors
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the declaration or payment of such dividends
is inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of ParentÂ’s Board of Directors
to ParentÂ’s shareholders or violates applicable law. Parent agrees to consult
with the Company prior to making any determination to reduce the amount of the
regular quarterly cash dividends in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock
below $0.54 per share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the proviso
to the preceding sentence.

to information relating to the other party or such other partyÂ’s business,
financial condition or results of operations. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that

subject to Section 7.4(b) through Section 7.4(e), use its reasonable best

in order to make the statements therein not misleading. The information
supplied or to be supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which shall be included in the Registration

obtain the Required Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, the
Company shall have the right on one or more occasions to postpone or adjourn

to) furnish promptly to the other party hereto and its representatives
(including Financing Sources and their representatives), consistent with its
legal obligations, all other information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as such Person may reasonably request; provided, however, that
either party hereto may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that, in
such PersonÂ’s reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would result in
the waiver of any attorney-client privilege, in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if such Person shall have used all reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such access, or (ii) any law,
treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to such
Person requires such Person or its Subsidiaries to preclude the other party
and its representatives from gaining access to any properties or information,
provided, further, that the Company will inform Parent of the general nature
of the document or information being withheld and reasonably cooperate with
Parent to provide such document or information in a manner that would not
result in violation of law or the loss or waiver of such privilege. No
investigation by Parent or its representatives shall affect or be deemed to
modify or waive the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in this Agreement. Each party hereto will hold any such information that is
non-public in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with,

approvals; provided, however, that efforts in connection with the Financing
and the Required Indebtedness, other than notices and applications with State
Regulators required in connection with the Financing and the Required
Indebtedness, shall be governed by Section 7.11 and not this Section 7.3. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees
(A) to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within 40 calendar days after the

this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Communications Act, the Cable Landing
License Act, or any other Regulatory Law (as defined below), (i) cooperate in
all respects and consult with each other in connection with any communication,

advisable or proper to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to the funding of the Financing set
forth in the Commitment Letter, Fee Letter and any definitive agreements
executed in connection therewith, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter (including after giving effect to any
"market flex" provisions set forth in the Fee Letter executed in connection
with the Financing) or on other terms consistent with Section 7.11(b) below,
(iv) in the event that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letter and
Fee Letter have been satisfied and Parent and Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2
are required to consummate the Closing pursuant to the terms hereof, draw a
sufficient amount of the Financing or Alternative Financing to enable Parent,
Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 to consummate the Merger; it being understood
that the receipt of the Financing or Alternative Financing is not a condition
to ParentÂ’s, Merger Sub 1Â’s or Merger Sub 2Â’s obligation to consummate the
Closing on the terms and conditions set forth herein and (v) enforce the
counterpartiesÂ’ obligations and ParentÂ’s rights under the Commitment Letter
in the event of a breach or repudiation by any party thereto that could
reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the Closing (giving
effect to the availability of any Alternative Financing).

 

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 to,
agree to or permit any amendment, replacements, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights or remedies under, the Commitment
Letter or Fee Letter without the CompanyÂ’s prior written consent; provided
that Parent may, without the CompanyÂ’s prior written consent, (x) enter into
any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of
any provision of the Commitment Letter or Fee Letter if such amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver does not (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing contemplated thereunder, other than as
permitted hereunder, or (ii) add new (or adversely modify any existing)
condition to the consummation of the Financing, as compared to those in the
Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as in effect on the date hereof, that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (in each case, giving effect to the availability of any Alternative
Financing) (each of clauses (i) and (ii), an " _Adverse Effect on the_
_Financing_ "); and (y) amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement so long as any
such addition would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially hinder
or

 



- 58 \-  materially delay the consummation of the Financing or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the availability of the Financing under the
Commitment Letter (it being understood that any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification that provides for the assignment of a portion
of the commitments thereunder to any additional lenders, lead arrangers, book
runners, syndication agents or similar entities and the granting to such
persons of customary approval rights shall be permitted hereunder and shall be
deemed to not prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the consummation
of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Company copies (redacted only as to fee amounts,
dates and certain other economic terms, including in respect of the "market
flex" and "securities demand" provisions, in the case of the Fee Letter) of
any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver of
the Commitment Letter or Fee Letter.

 

(c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letter
(including after giving effect to the "market flex" provisions set forth in
the Fee Letter executed in connection with the Financing) for any reason,
Parent shall, in consultation with the Company, use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, alternative financing from the same or alternative
sources in an amount sufficient (together with cash on hand of the Company) to
fund the Cash Consideration, the cash payable to holders of Company RSU
Awards pursuant to Section 1.8, the Required Indebtedness and all other fees
and expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
which would not contain any provisions that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
Financing or Alternative Financing or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any conditions to the closing of such Financing or
Alternative Financing that are materially less favorable to Parent than the
conditions to closing in the Commitment Letter (as defined immediately prior
to such Alternative Financing). In addition, Parent shall have the right to
substitute the proceeds of consummated offerings or other incurrences of debt
for all or any portion of the Financing by reducing commitments under the
Commitment Letter. Further, Parent shall have the right to substitute
commitments in respect of other financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same and/or alternative bona fide third party financing
sources so long as such substitution would not reasonably be expected to have
an Adverse Effect on the Financing (any such financing which satisfies this
Section 7.11(c), the " _Alternative Financing_ "). If an Alternative Financing
is required or otherwise obtained in accordance with this Section 7.11(c),
Parent shall obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with a copy of, a
new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing, and
Parent shall comply with its covenants in Section 7.11(a) and Section
7.11(b) with respect to the Commitment Letter (as defined immediately after
receipt of such Alternative Financing).

(d) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of any material
breach or repudiation by any party of the Commitment Letter or Fee Letter of
which Parent becomes aware or any termination of the Commitment Letter or Fee
Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate
the Financing.

(e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and to cause
Company Financing to, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of a
written request from Parent to do so, (i) commence a consent solicitation with
respect to any or all of the CompanyÂ’s and/or Company FinancingÂ’s outstanding
senior notes (the " _Notes_ "), on such terms and conditions as may be
specified by Parent to amend or waive the indenture applicable to each series
of Notes with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of
the outstanding securities of such series, solely to provide that no offer to
repurchase the Notes will be required as a result of any "Change of Control
Triggering Event" (as defined in the applicable indentures) occurring in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Notes
COC Consent Solicitations_ ") and/or (ii) seek the consent of the requisite
lenders under the Credit Agreement, dated as of March 13, 2007, among Parent,
Company Financing, Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, as administrative agent,
and the other parties thereto (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified,
the " _Existing Credit Agreement_ "), on such terms and conditions as may be
specified by Parent to amend or waive the Existing Credit Agreement with the
consent of Required Lenders (as defined therein) solely to provide that no
repayment of any loans or other extensions of 

 



- 59 \-  credit thereunder will be required as a result of any "Change of Control
Triggering Event" (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) occurring in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Credit Agreement COC Consent Solicitation_ ", and together with the Notes COC
Consent Solicitation, the " _COC Consent Solicitations_ "). In addition,
Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or an affiliate thereof may (i) commence
one or more offers to purchase or exchange with respect to any and all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the CompanyÂ’s Notes for cash or
other securities (including securities of Parent or its Subsidiaries) on
terms that are determined by Parent and in compliance with applicable law
(including SEC rules and regulations) and the provisions of the indentures
governing the applicable series of Notes to be consummated substantially
simultaneously with the Closing and no earlier than the Effective Time using
funds or other consideration provided by Parent (the " _Offers to Purchase_
"), and/or (ii) solicit the consent of the holders of each series of Notes,
regarding certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing such series
of Notes (the " _Indenture Amendments_ ") as determined by Parent and in
compliance with applicable law (including SEC rules and regulations) and the
provisions of the indentures governing the applicable series of Notes and as
set forth in the tender offer and consent solicitation documents sent to
holders of such series of Notes to become effective substantially
simultaneously with the Closing and no earlier than the Effective Time, which
amendments may include the elimination of all or substantially all of the
restrictive covenants and certain other provisions contained in the indenture
governing such series of Notes that can be eliminated upon the favorable vote
of the holders of a majority of the principal amount thereof (the " _Other
Consent Solicitations_ " and, together with the COC Consent Solicitations and
the Offers to Purchase, the " _Debt Offers_ "). Any documentation relating to
any Debt Offer (including all amendments or supplements thereto) (the "
_Offer_ _Documents_ ") and all material requested to be published or mailed to
the holders of the Notes and/or provided to the lenders or agents under the
Existing Credit Agreement in connection with any Debt Offer shall be subject
to the prior review of (which review shall be made as promptly as reasonably
practicable), and comment by the Company and shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Company; provided that, in any event, Parent and the Company hereby
agree that (i) the terms and conditions of any Debt Offer (other than the COC
Consent Solicitations) shall provide that the closing thereof shall
be contingent upon the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time; and
(ii) promptly upon expiration of any COC Consent Solicitations or any Other
Consent Solicitations, assuming the requisite consents have been received with
respect to such series of Notes or under the Existing Credit Agreement, the
Company or Company Financing, as applicable, shall execute a supplemental
indenture to the indentures governing each series of Notes or an amendment to
the Existing Credit Agreement (that other than with respect to any COC
Consent Solicitation will not become operative prior to the Effective Time)
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under each such
indenture and lenders and/or agent under the Existing Credit Agreement to
enter into such supplemental indenture or amendment prior to or substantially
simultaneously with the execution thereof by the Company or Company Financing.
Concurrent with the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of
the Debt Offer, the Surviving Company shall accept for purchase and purchase
each series of Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the
Offers to Purchase using funds or other consideration provided by or at the
direction of Parent. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to, promptly
following the Effective Time, directly or indirectly pay for the Notes
properly tendered and not withdrawn to the extent required pursuant to the
terms of the Offer to Purchase. Any Indenture Amendments contemplated by any
Debt Offer (other than any COC Consent Solicitation) shall revert to the form
in effect prior to the effectiveness of any Indenture Amendments and be of no
further effect if the Closing does not occur.

 

(f) If at any time prior to the completion of any Debt Offer any information
should be discovered by the Company or by Parent that the Company or Parent
reasonably believes should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such
information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the
holders of the applicable Notes and/or the lenders and agents under the
Existing Credit Agreement. The parties shall comply with the requirements of
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable, and any other
applicable laws in connection with any Debt Offer.

 



- 60 \- (g) Parent shall select and pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any
dealer manager, information agent, depositary, trustee or other agent
retained in connection with any Debt Offer, and pay all consent fees (or
provide the Company or such Subsidiary with the funds required therefor in
advance of the required payment thereof) payable in connection with any Debt
Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any consent fees that are
required to be paid prior to the Effective Time and all consent fees with
respect to any COC Consent Solicitation, notwithstanding that
any supplemental indentures to the indentures governing each series of Notes
and/or an amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement entered into in
connection with the COC Consent Solicitation may become operative prior to the
Effective Time). At ParentÂ’s expense, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that
is necessary or reasonably required in connection with the Debt Offer,
including, without limitation, (i) to the extent required by the policies or
procedures of the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") in connection with any
consent solicitation that is part of any Debt Offer, the Company or Company
Financing conducting any such consent solicitation, (ii) executing
supplemental indentures to the indentures governing each series of Notes
and/or an amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement (that other than in the
case of the COC Consent Solicitations will become operative only immediately
upon the Effective Time), and (iii) using reasonable best efforts to cause the
trustee under each such indenture and the lenders and/or agent under the
Existing Credit Agreement to enter such supplemental indenture and/or
amendment prior or substantially simultaneously with execution thereof by the
Company and/or Company Financing, and (iv) providing the information necessary
to distribute the applicable Offer Documents to the holders of the applicable
series of Notes and/or the lenders and agents under the Existing Credit
Agreement. If requested by Parent in writing in connection with any COC
Consent Solicitation with respect to the Notes, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, or shall cause their counsel to, deliver legal opinions
in customary form and scope relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries, the
Existing Credit Agreement and/or the indentures governing the Notes required
in connection with the COC Consent Solicitations, but shall not be required
to deliver, or to cause its counsel to deliver, any legal opinions in
connection with any other Debt Offer.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.11,
the Company shall not be required to take any action in connection with any
Debt Offer that it believes, after consultation with counsel, could reasonably
be expected to cause the Company to violate (i) federal or state securities
laws or (ii) the provisions of the indentures governing the applicable series
of Notes or the Existing Credit Agreement. It is expressly agreed by the
parties hereto that the failure to obtain the consent of the holders of the
Notes or the consent of the requisite lenders under the Existing Credit
Agreement in connection with any Debt Offer shall not be deemed to be a breach
by the Company under this Agreement or a failure of any condition hereto.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent, Merger Sub 1
and Merger Sub 2, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the respective officers, employees, agents
and representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent,

that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with any financing by
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Combination, including

connection therewith) and (2) customary pro forma financial statements
reflecting the Merger and the Financing; (iii) executing and delivering
definitive financing documents, (and assisting in the preparation of
applicable schedules and other information necessary in connection therewith)

currency or interest hedging agreements, certificates, and other definitive
financing documents, provided that no obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such document or agreement shall be effective until the
Effective Time; (iv) using reasonable best efforts to facilitate the pledging

Parent), provided that no pledge or pay-off of Existing Indebtedness shall be
effective or required, as the case may be, until the Effective Time; (v) using

and the Financing Sources, as promptly as reasonably practicable, financial

financial statements relating to any such financing and using reasonable best
efforts to cause such independent accountants to provide customary comfort
letters (including "negative assurance" comfort) in connection therewith to
the applicable underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, (vii)

data or information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably

Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act for a
registered public offering by Parent, in each case, meeting the respective
requirements of the condition set forth in paragraphs 6 and 7 of Exhibit F to

Entities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules

case, solely as relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, their respective directors and officers), (xi) assist
Parent in ensuring that the syndication efforts benefit from the existing
banking relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (xii) taking
such other customary actions as are reasonably requested by Parent or the
Financing Sources to facilitate the satisfaction of all conditions precedent

within the control of the Company (including delivery of the stock and other

authorization of any of the Financing other than to approve regulatory
filings relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection therewith
and as may be required in connection with any COC Consent Solicitation
pursuant to Section 7.11(e) and any assumption pursuant to Section 7.11(k).
The Company will provide to Parent and the Financing Sources such information
about the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be necessary so that the
marketing materials for the Financing are complete and correct with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries in all material respects and do not and will

to the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the light of the circumstances under
which such statements are made, not materially misleading.

Subsidiaries provided to Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and their
respective representatives pursuant to this Section 7.11 shall be kept
confidential by them in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided that Parent may disclose such information to Financing Sources as
would be reasonable and customary in connection with any financing in
connection with the Combination. The Company hereby consents to the use
of all of its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ logos in connection with the Financing;
provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to

Parent, delivering such certificates, opinions or other documents and taking
such actions (and using reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable
lenders, agents and/or trustees in respect thereof to take such actions) as
may be required as may be required in connection therewith by the applicable
credit agreements, indentures or other definitive documents governing such
Indebtedness) effective as of (or at ParentÂ’s election, following) the
Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, or shall cause their counsel to, furnish legal opinions
in customary form and scope relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
required by the applicable credit agreements, indentures or other definitive
documents relating to such Indebtedness in connection with the matters
contemplated by this Section 7.11(k).

(l) Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses

connection with the Financing and/or any Debt Offer), or in connection with
compliance with its obligations under this Section 7.11, and Parent hereby
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, the " _Financing Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
liabilities, damages, claims, costs, expenses or losses suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the Financing and Debt Offers, any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than arising from information
provided in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries) and any misuse of the
logos or marks of the Company or its Subsidiaries, except to the extent that
such liabilities, damages, claims, costs,

faith, intentional breach or willful misconduct of a Financing Indemnitee (the
obligations in this sentence, the " _Financing Cooperation Indemnity_ ").

(m) For the avoidance of doubt, each of Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub
2 acknowledges that obtaining the Financing (or any Alternative Financing) or
any specific term with respect to such financing is not a condition to the
obligations of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(n) From and after the date hereof and until the earlier to occur of the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX
hereof, the Company shall promptly give written notice with particularity upon
having Knowledge of any "Default" or "Event of Default" that has occurred or
is threatened in writing under any of the indentures governing the Notes or
the Existing Credit Agreement (in each case, with "Default" and "Event of
Default" having the meanings provided in such document); provided, however,
that a failure to give notice pursuant to this Section 7.12(n) shall be
excluded for purposes of the condition set forth in Section 8.2(b).

Section 9.3. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
stockholders or which reduces the Merger Consideration or adversely affects
the holders of Company Common Stock, without approval by such holders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto; provided that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, none of Section 9.2(a), 9.4, 10.3, 10.4,
10.10 or 10.13 or this Section 9.3 (or any other provision of this Agreement
to the extent an amendment of such provision would modify the substance of any
of Section 9.2(a), 9.4, 10.3, 10.4, 10.10 or 10.13 or this Section 9.3) may be

agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights. No waivers to the provisions of which the Financing Sources are
expressly made third party beneficiaries pursuant to Section 10.10 shall be
permitted in a manner materially adverse to any such Financing Source without
the prior written consent of the Lead Arrangers (as defined in the Commitment
