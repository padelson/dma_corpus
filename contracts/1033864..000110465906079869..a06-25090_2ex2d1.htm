# 

  

2.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

  



  

At the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof:

  



  

### (a) Each share of common stock, **** $.01 **** par value per share, of
the Company ("Company Common Stock"), which shall be outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Date (other than shares owned by Purchaser or the
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, all of which shall be
canceled, and Dissenting Shares (the "Converted Shares") shall at the
Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into and represent the right to receive
$10.00 per share (the "Merger Price") in cash without any interest thereon.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each share of Common Stock, $.01 par value, of Merger Sub which shall
be outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall at the Effective
Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into one share of the common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### 2.2 _Dissenting Shares_.

  

### 

  

Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Date and that have not been voted for adoption of the
Merger and with respect of which appraisal rights have been properly demanded
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL ("Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the consideration
provided for in _Section 2.1_ at or after the Effective Date unless and until
the holder of such shares withdraws his demand for such appraisal (in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL) or becomes ineligible
for such appraisal. If a holder of Dissenting Shares withdraws his demand for
such appraisal (in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL) or
becomes ineligible for such appraisal, then, as of the Effective Date or the
occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such holders Dissenting
Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive the consideration provided for in _Section
2.1_. If any holder of Company Common Stock shall assert the right to be paid
the fair value of such Company Common Stock as described above, the Company
shall give Purchaser prompt notice thereof and Purchaser shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for payment. After the Effective Date, Purchaser will cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay its statutory obligations to holders of
Dissenting Shares.

  



  

2.3 _Stock Option Plans._

  



  

At the Effective Date, the holders of then outstanding options to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under the Companys stock option plans (the
"Stock Option Plans"), whether or not then exercisable (collectively the
"Options") shall, in cancellation

  



        
   

  



  

and settlement thereof, receive for each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Option an amount (subject to any applicable withholding
tax) in cash equal to the difference between the Merger Price and the per
share exercise price of such Option to the extent such difference is a
positive number (such amount being hereinafter referred to as, the "Option
Consideration"). The surrender of an Option to the Company in exchange for
the Option Consideration shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the
holder had or may have had in respect of such Option. The Stock Option Plans
shall terminate as of the Effective Date, and the provisions in any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any subsidiary
thereof shall be canceled as of the Effective Date. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall take all action necessary to (i) ensure that, following the
Effective Date, no participant in the Stock Option Plans or any other plans,
programs or arrangements shall have any right thereunder to acquire equity
securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary
thereof and (ii) terminate all such plans, programs and arrangements.

  



  

2.4 _Adjustment_.

  



  

If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date or the Effective
Date, as the case may be, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class by reason of any classification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares, or readjustment or a stock dividend thereon
shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the
consideration to be received pursuant to this _Article 2_ by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and/or Options shall be adjusted to accurately
reflect such change.

  



  

2.5 _Exchange Agent_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall authorize the Companys transfer agent, or other
corporate trust operation selected by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to
the Company, to serve as exchange agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent").
Immediately prior to the Effective Date, Purchaser shall deposit or shall
cause to be deposited in trust with the Exchange Agent the cash amount of the
Merger Price and Option Consideration with respect to each Converted Share
and Option, as the case may be (such cash amount being hereinafter referred
to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Purchaser only in direct obligations of the United
States, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States
is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, commercial
paper rated of the highest quality by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation or certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of a commercial bank having at least
$100,000,000 in assets (collectively, "Permitted Investments") or in money
market funds which are invested in Permitted Investments, and any net
earnings with respect thereto shall be paid to Purchaser as and when
requested by Purchaser. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions received from Purchaser, pay the Merger Price and Option
Consideration with respect to such Converted Share and Option, as the case
may be, as provided for in this _Article 2_ out of the Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in
this Agreement, or as otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and Company prior to
the Effective Date.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, the Exchange Agent
shall mail and otherwise make available to each record holder (other than
holders of Dissenting Shares) who, as of the Effective Date, was a holder of
an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Date represented shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") and to each holder of Options under the Stock Option Plans
recorded on Companys books a form of letter of transmittal and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Options for
payment therefor and conversion thereof, which letter of transmittal shall be
prepared by the Purchaser and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company,
and shall comply with all applicable rules of the Nasdaq.

  

### 

  

### (c) Delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and the form of letter of transmittal
shall so reflect. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
representing the cash consideration to which such holder shall have become
entitled pursuant to this _Article 2_ , and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon surrender of the Certificates.

  

### 

  

### (d) Options shall be cancelled as of the Effective Date and upon the
occurrence of the Effective Date the holder of each Option shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the cash consideration
to which such holder will have become entitled pursuant to this _Article 2_
(less applicable withholding taxes). No interest will be paid or accrued on
the cash payable upon the cancellation of Options.

  

### 

  

### (e) If any portion of the consideration to be received pursuant to this
_Article 2_  upon exchange of a Certificate is to be issued or paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such issuance and
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a check representing cash to such other Person, or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or that no such tax is applicable. From the Effective Date until
surrender in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.5_ , each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing treasury shares of Company
and Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the consideration provided in this
_Article 2_. All payments in respect of shares of Company Common Stock that
are made in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
made in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such securities.

  

### 

  

### (f) In the case of any lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed Certificates,
the holder thereof will be required to tender a notarized affidavit of lost
certificate, including an agreement to indemnify the Surviving Corporation in
the event that a bona fide holder in due course submits the Certificate and
seeks to receive the merger consideration payable in respect thereof, and may
be required, as a condition precedent to the delivery to such holder of the
consideration described in this _Article 2_ , to deliver to Purchaser a bond
in such

  



        
   

  



  

### reasonable sum as Purchaser may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost,
mislaid, stolen or destroyed.

  

### 

  

### (g) After the Effective Date, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date. If,
after the Effective Date, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
consideration described in this _Article 2_. From and after the Effective
Date, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect
to the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Company for six months after the Effective Date shall be
returned to Purchaser, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock
who has not theretofore complied with _Section 2.5(c)_ shall thereafter look
only to Purchaser for payment of the consideration to which such holder has
become entitled pursuant to this _Article 2_. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any
amount properly paid from the Exchange Fund or delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

### 

  

### (i) If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to three
years after the Effective Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or became the
property of any Governmental Body), any such portion of the Exchange Fund in
respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### 2.6 _Subsequent Actions_.

  

### 

  

If at any time after the Effective Date the Surviving Corporation will
consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances
or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company,
all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

of any securities of any Company Entity that is necessary to adopt this
Agreement.

  



  

3.5 _Binding Effect_.

consummation of the Merger and the fulfillment of and compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement do not and will not, with the passing
of time or the giving of notice or both, violate or conflict with, constitute

is no pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, suit, claim,
charge, grievance, action or litigation, or administrative, arbitration or
other proceeding or investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Body against
any Company Entity or to which their businesses or assets are subject. No
Company Entity is subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order
of any court, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any restriction imposed by
any Governmental Body applicable to any Company Entity, which has had or
would reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. _Schedule 3.11_ lists and describes all
judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules, and orders of any court or
Governmental Body to which the Company is subject.

  



  

3.12 _Properties_.

  



  

 _Schedule 3.12_  lists and describes briefly (i) all real property that the
Company Entities own and (ii) all real property leased to any Company Entity,
the location, the rent, any deposits, and the expiration dates under such
leases. The Company has good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold or
license interest in, all tangible properties and assets (real, personal and
mixed) reflected on the Most Recent Balance Sheet or acquired after the date
thereof (except for properties and assets sold or otherwise disposed of in
the ordinary course of business since the date of the Most Recent Balance
Sheet) necessary for the present or proposed conduct of its business, free
and clear of any and all liens, charges, easements, adverse claims, demands,
encumbrances, limitations, mortgages, security interests, options, pledges,
or any other title defect or restriction of any kind (collectively "Liens"),
subject only to (i) statutory Liens arising or incurred in the ordinary
course of business with respect to which the underlying obligations are not
delinquent, (ii) Liens for taxes, assessments or other charges or levies
imposed by any Governmental Body which are not yet due and payable, (iii)
Liens which are not substantial in character, amount, or extent, and which do
not materially detract from the value, or interfere with the present use, of
the property subject thereto or affect thereby **** or (iv) Liens reflected on
the Most Recent Balance Sheet (collectively, "Permitted Liens"). Each Company
Entity has a valid leasehold interest under each such lease, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity), and there is no
default by the Company under any such lease or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, by any other party thereto; and except as set forth on _Schedule
3.12_ , no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving

  



        
   

  



  

of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder. Each Company Entity
has been in peaceable possession of the premises covered by each such lease
or sublease since the commencement of the original term of such lease
or sublease.

  



  

3.13 _Intellectual Property_.

  



  

### (a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13(a)_ , the Company Entities own
all right, title and interest in, or have valid, binding and enforceable
rights to use, all Intellectual Property necessary for the business of the
Company Entities, without any conflict with the rights of others (an "IP
Assignment Agreement"). "Intellectual Property" means all intellectual
property, including without limitation, all (i) patents, inventions,
trademarks, service marks, trade names, Internet domain names, copyrights,
designs and trade secrets; (ii) applications for and registrations of such
patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, copyrights and
designs; (iii) lists (including customer lists), databases, processes,
formulae, methods, schematics, technology, know-how, computer software
programs and related documentation; (iv) computer software, data and
databases including, without limitation, object code, source code, related
documentation and all copyrights therein and (v) other tangible or intangible
proprietary or confidential information and materials.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Schedule 3.13(b)_ sets forth (i) each patent and registration which
has been issued to any Company Entity with respect to any of
their Intellectual Property, (ii) each pending patent application or
application for registration which any Company Entity has made with respect
to any of their Intellectual Property, (iii) all computer software owned by
and distributed or maintained by any Company Entity ("Company Software");
(iv) other than customer contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business, each license, agreement or other permission which any Company
Entity has granted to any third party with respect to any of its Intellectual
Property, including reseller agreements; (v)(1) all computer software
licenses or similar agreements or arrangements through which any Company
Entity embeds, integrates, bundles, redistributes, resells or otherwise
sublicenses such software ("Third Party Software"); (2) all computer software
licenses or similar agreements or arrangements to support the development of
the Company Software for which any Company Entity has, during the past three
fiscal years, paid more than $25,000 in the aggregate in license fees or pays
more than $25,000 in annual support fees; or (3) all computer software
licenses or similar agreements or arrangements relating to information
technology used in the business of the Company Entities for which any Company
Entity has, during the past three fiscal years, paid more than $50,000 in the
aggregate in license fees or pays more than $25,000 in annual support fees;
or (vi) all other material agreements or similar arrangements, in effect as
of the date hereof, relating to the use of Intellectual Property by any
Company Entity, including, without limitation, settlement agreements,
consent-to-use or standstill agreements, standalone source code escrow
agreements, outsourcing agreements relating to software development or
information technology, and standalone indemnification agreements
(collectively, all agreements set forth under Subsections (iv), (v) and (vi)
will be referred to as "IP Agreements").

  

### 

  

### (c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13(c)_ , no Company Entity, nor
the conduct of their respective businesses or operations, ****
infringes, violates or misappropriates, or has

  



        
   

  



  

### been alleged to infringe, violate or misappropriate, any Intellectual
Property of any third party. No Company Entity has received any notice
(including, without limitation, any demand letter or offer to license) from
any third party pertaining to or challenging the right of any Company Entity
to use any Intellectual Property owned by any Company Entity or used pursuant
to an agreement set forth on _Schedule 3.13(b)_. No claim by any third party
contesting the validity, enforceability or ownership of any Intellectual
Property owned or used by any Company Entity is currently outstanding or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened.

  

### 

  

### (d) To the Knowledge of the Company, no third party is infringing,
violating or misappropriating any of the Intellectual Property owned by any
Company Entity and to the Knowledge of the Company there are no facts that
indicate a likelihood of the foregoing. All Intellectual Property owned by
any Company Entity, including, without limitation, the Company Software was
developed by employees of a Company Entity working within the scope of their
employment or as a work for hire at the time of such development.

  

### 

  

(e) The Companys general policy is, and during the preceding three years has
been, to require that each of the former and current employees, and the
consultants and contractors of each Company Entity who have developed or have
or have had access to Intellectual Property or other confidential
information, execute written instruments that (x) assign to any Company
Entity all of such Persons rights, title and interest in and to any and all
Intellectual Property and (y) include confidentiality provisions in favor of
any Company Entity. _Schedule 3.13(e)_ sets forth the names of any current
product development employees of, or consultants to, any Company Entity which
have not executed an IP Agreement. The failure to secure an IP
Assignment Agreement from any employee of or consultant to the Company will
not result in, or could reasonably be foreseeable in causing, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

### (f) Each Company Entity has taken commercially reasonable security
measures to protect the secrecy, confidentiality and value of all trade
secrets owned by any Company Entity or used or held for use by any Company
Entity (the "Company Trade Secrets").

  

### 

  

### (g) _Schedule 3.13(g)_ identifies any and all software (in source
or object code form) subject to a license commonly referred to as an open
source, free software, copyleft or community source code license (including
but not limited to any library or code licensed under the GNU General Public
License, GNU Lesser General Public License or any other restrictive license
arrangement) ("Open Source Software") that has, during the last five fiscal
years, been incorporated into, integrated or bundled with, linked to or
otherwise used in or with, or used in the development of, any of the products
of any Company Entity or any of the Intellectual Property ("Company Open
Source Software");

  

### 

  

### (h) _Schedule 3.13(h)_ identifies (A) the name of any of the Open
Source Software identified in _Schedule 3.13(g)_ , (B) a description of
each Company Entitys past, present and intended future usage of such Open
Source Software, (C) license type of such Open Source Software, (D) products
with which it interacts or effects, (E) a description of any distribution of
any such Open Source Software, (F) the Companys reasonably detailed
explanation of why such Open Source Software does not adversely affect any of
the Intellectual Property

  



        
   

  



  

### and (G) an indication of whether the Company believes that its use of any
such Open Source Software will subject any Company Entitys Intellectual
Property to the terms of such Open Source Software and, if yes, a reasonably
detailed explanation of the consequences thereof.

  

### 

  

### (i) with respect to any such Company Open Source Software, _Schedule
3.13(i)_ sets forth the incorporation, linking, calling or other use by the
products of any Company Entity or any other Intellectual Property. Use of any
of the Company Open Source Software does not obligate, nor would it obligate
upon distribution, any Company Entity to make available, offer or deliver the
source code of any product of any Company Entity or any component thereof or
any other Intellectual Property to any third party.

  

### 

  

### (k) No Company Entity has in connection with any collection of personally
identifiable information, failed to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to comply with all applicable statutes, rules and regulations in all relevant
jurisdictions and its publicly available privacy policy (if any) relating to
the collection, storage and onward transfer of all personally identifiable
information collected by any Company Entity or by any third party having
authorized access to the databases or other records of any Company Entity.

  

### 

  

### (l) To the Knowledge of the Company, no product of any Company Entity
(excluding third party products which are sold separately by the Company and
are not integrated into the Companys products) contains any "viruses,"
"worms," "time bombs," "key-locks" or any other devices that could disrupt or
interfere with the operation of such products or equipment upon which such
products operate, or the integrity of the data, information or signals such
products produce.

  

### 

  

3.14 _Material Contracts_.

  



  

The Company has furnished to the Purchaser accurate and complete copies of
the Material Contracts of each Company Entity, all of which are listed on
_Schedule 3.14_  (along with a description or notation of why each such
contract is a Material Contract); provided, however, that the Company is not
required to furnish a copy of any agreements with Material Customers pursuant
to clause (v) of the definition of Material Contracts below unless such
Material Customer either (i) accounted for more than $250,000 of revenue
during the year ended July 31, 2006 or (ii) was one of the Companys 30
largest customers (measured by revenue) in either of the two fiscal years
ended July 31, 2005. There is not under any of the Material Contracts any
existing breach, default or event of default by any Company Entity, nor event
that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a breach, default
or event of default by any Company Entity; nor does the Company have
Knowledge of, and the Company has not received notice of, or made a claim
with respect to, any breach or default by any other party thereto. Each
Material Contract is valid and binding on the applicable Company Entity and
is in full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of the Company, is not the
subject of any renegotiation by the counterparty (other than
customary addenda for the provision of additional products or services in the
case of customer contracts, and settlements described on _Schedule 3.10_ ).
As used herein, the term "Material Contracts" shall mean any contract,
agreement or arrangement (whether written or oral) of any Company Entity
that: (i) is filed, or required to be filed, as an exhibit to the Company SEC

instrument, including, without limitation, any loan agreement, promissory
note, security agreement or other evidence of "Indebtedness," where any
Company Entity is a lender or borrower; (iv) that restricts any Company
Entity from engagement in any line of business; (v) is an agreement with a
Material Customer with a term in excess of six months; (vi) any joint venture
or teaming agreement; (vii) any agreement providing for contingent
consideration; (viii) any agreement, option, commitment or rights with, to or
in any third party to acquire or to sell a material business division or unit
after the date hereof; (ix) any agreement or contract not made in the
ordinary course of business; (x) all IP Agreements set forth on _Schedule
3.13(b)_ ; (xi) any agreement that is set forth on _Schedule 3.6_ ; (xii)
includes a "future pricing" provision (i.e., a commitment to pricing with
respect to products or services to be delivered pursuant to arrangements
after the date of this Agreement that can not be changed by the Company on
less than 30 days notice), other than inflation (CPI) adjustments and
similar provisions; or (xiii) includes a "future product" provision (i.e., a
requirement that any Company Entity build, customize or tailor a product
for a customer, partner, reseller or other contractual counter-party), other
than future product provisions entered into in the ordinary course of
business providing for standard upgrades or releases of fixes or patches as
part of customary maintenance and support services. As used in this
Agreement, "Indebtedness" means (1) indebtedness for borrowed money, whether
secured or unsecured, (2) other indebtedness evidenced by notes, bonds or
debentures, (3) all indebtedness for the deferred purchase price of property
or services, whether or not represented by a note, (4) all indebtedness
created or arising under any conditional sale or other title retention
agreement with respect to property acquired by such Person (even though the
rights and remedies of the seller or lender under such agreement in the event
of default are limited to repossession or sale of such property), (5) all
indebtedness secured by a purchase money mortgage or other lien to secure all
or part of the purchase price of the property subject to such mortgage or
lien, (6) capitalized leases, (7) all interest, fees and other expenses and
amounts owed with respect to the indebtedness referred to above, and (8) all
indebtedness referred to above which is directly or indirectly guaranteed by
any Company Entity or to which any Company Entity has agreed (contingently or
otherwise) to purchase or otherwise acquire or in respect of which it has
otherwise assured a creditor against loss).

 _Schedule 3.15_  contains a complete and accurate description of all
policies or binders of insurance held by or on behalf of any Company Entity
or insuring any of its employees, properties or assets (specifying the
insurer, the amount of the coverage, the type of insurance, the risks
insured, the expiration date, the policy number, the premium and any agent or
broker). Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.15_ , all such policies are in
full force and effect and no Company Entity is in default of any provision
thereof. All such insurance is of such types and in such amounts and for such
risks, casualties and contingencies as is reasonable based upon the business
of the Company Entities, as currently conducted. As of the date hereof, there
are no pending or asserted claims outstanding against any insurance carrier
(excluding health and disability insurance claims) as to which any insurer
has denied liability, and there are no pending or asserted claims outstanding
under any such insurance policy or binder that have been disallowed or
improperly filed.

requirements applicable to it or to the conduct of its business or operations

Company Entity has all material permits and approvals from state, federal or
local Governmental Bodies which are required for the Company to operate its
business.

  

### 

  

### (b) No Company Entity nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of their

behalf of any Company Entity, has accepted or received any unlawful
contributions, payments, gifts or expenditures.

occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure

### 

  

5.6 _Public Announcements_.

  



  

The timing and content of all announcements regarding any aspect of this
Agreement or the Merger to the financial community, Governmental Bodies,
employees or the general public shall be mutually agreed upon in advance
(unless Purchaser or the Company is

  



        
   

  



  

advised by counsel that any such announcement or other disclosure
not mutually agreed upon in advance is required to be made by Law or
applicable stock exchange rule and then only after making a reasonable
attempt to comply with the provisions of this Section).

  



  

5.7 _No Solicitations_.

  



  

### (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Date or until this Agreement
is terminated or abandoned as provided in this Agreement, no Company Entity
shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit or initiate discussion with, (ii)
enter into negotiations or agreements with, (iii) intentionally furnish any
information to, or (iv) take any other action to solicit any inquiries from,
any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, Person or other
entity or group (other than Purchaser, an Affiliate of Purchaser or their
authorized representatives pursuant to this Agreement) concerning any
proposal for a merger, sale of substantial assets, sale of shares of stock or
securities, business combination, or other takeover or business combination
transaction (including, without limitation, by way of a tender offer,
foreclosure, plan of reorganization or liquidation) (an "Acquisition
Proposal") involving any Company Entity, and the Company shall instruct, and
use all reasonable efforts to cause, its officers, directors, advisors and
its financial and legal representatives and consultants not to take any
action contrary to the foregoing provisions of this sentence. The Company
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing in this _Section 5.7_
shall prevent the Company or the Board of Directors from taking, and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders, a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any tender
offer or from making such disclosure to the Companys stockholders which,
upon the advice of independent outside counsel, is required under applicable
Law (provided that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors may
recommend any Acquisition Proposal except to the extent contemplated by
_Section 8.1(f)_ and any withdrawal, modification or change in a manner
adverse to Purchaser its recommendation to the stockholders of the Company to
approve this Agreement and the Merger will provide Purchaser with the right
to terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section 8.1(g)_ ) and (ii) the
Company may prior to adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders
in accordance with this Agreement, directly or indirectly, provide access and
furnish information concerning its business, properties or assets to any
Person or group pursuant to appropriate confidentiality agreements, and may
negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such entity or
group if (w) such entity or group has submitted an unsolicited bona fide
written proposal to the Board of Directors of the Company relating to any
such transaction, (x) such proposal provides for the acquisition for cash or
marketable securities of all of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and at such time the Company is not in breach of this _Section 5.7_ ,
(y) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor, that such proposal is
financially superior to the Merger and fully financed or reasonably capable
of being financed, and (z) the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith, after consultation with independent legal counsel, that the
failure to provide such information or access or to engage in such
discussions or negotiations would

  



        
   

  



  

### violate their fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law. A proposal meeting all of the criteria in clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence is referred to herein as a "Superior Proposal."

  

### 

  

### (c) The Company will notify Purchaser promptly if the Company becomes
aware that any inquiries or proposals are received by, any information is
requested from or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
with, the Company with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, and the Company
shall promptly deliver to Purchaser any written inquiries or proposals
received by the Company relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Each time, if
any, that the Board of Directors of the Company determines, upon advice of
such legal counsel and in the exercise of its good faith judgment as to its
fiduciary duties to stockholders, that it must enter into negotiations with,
or furnish any information to, any Person or group (other than Purchaser, an
Affiliate of Purchaser or their authorized representatives) concerning any
Acquisition Proposal, the Company will give Purchaser prompt notice of such
determination.

  

### 

  

### (d) The parties hereto agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the
requirements of this _Section 5.7_ will be inadequate and that any breach
would cause such immediate and permanent damage as would be impossible to
ascertain, and therefore, the parties hereto agree and consent that in the
event of any breach of this _Section 5.7_ , in addition to any and all other
legal and equitable remedies available for such breach pursuant to this
Agreement, the non-breaching parties shall be entitled to obtain preliminary
or permanent injuctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damage
by reason of such breach and, to the extent permissible under applicable Law,
a temporary restraining order may be granted immediately on commencement of
such action.

  

### 

  

### 5.8 _Indemnification_.

  

### 

  

In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without
limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in
which any of the present or former officers or directors (the "Managers") of
any Company Entity is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the
fact that he or she is or was a stockholder, director, officer, employee or
agent of any Company Entity, or is or was serving at the request of any
Company Entity as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether
before or after the Effective Date, the Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless, and from and after the Effective Date the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law (including by advancing expenses promptly as statements
therefor are received), each such Manager against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such
claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Date), (i) if the Company (prior to the Effective
Date) or the Surviving Corporation (after the Effective Date) have not
promptly assumed the defense of such matter, the Managers may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and the Company, or the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Date, shall pay all fees and expenses of such

  



        
   

  



  

counsel for the Managers promptly, as statements therefor are received, and
(ii) the Company, or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Date, will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to assist in the
vigorous defense of any such matter; provided that neither the Company nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld);
and provided further that the Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation
under the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.8_ to any Manager when and
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that
indemnification of such Manager in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law. Upon the finality of any such determination
that the Surviving Corporation is not liable for any such indemnification
claims, the Manager will reimburse Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation
for any fees, expenses and costs incurred by Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation in connection with the defense of such claims. Any Manager
wishing to claim indemnification under this  _Section 5.8_ , upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify the
Company and, after the Effective Date, the Surviving Corporation thereof
(provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect any
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby). The Company agrees that all
rights to indemnification existing in favor of the Managers as provided in
the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect as of the
date hereof, and in any agreement between the Company and any Manager with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Date shall survive
the Merger. The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each indemnified party and his
or her heirs and representatives.

  



  

5.9 _Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

  



  

For six years from the Effective Date, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered on the date of
this Agreement by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
policy (the "Indemnified Parties"); provided, however, that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of twice the most
recent annual premium for such insurance coverage; provided further, that if
the cost of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount; provided further, that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute for such Company policies, policies with
at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties and provided that said substitution
does not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Date. The provisions of this _Section 5.9_
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

  



  

5.10 _Financial Statements_.

  



  

From and after the date hereof until the Closing, as soon as practicable
after the end of each calendar month (but no later than thirty days after the
end of such calendar month),

  



        
   

  



  

the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser its regularly prepared internal
monthly management report, which includes a balance sheet and results of
operations for such calendar month (it being understood that such
statements do not contain all of the adjustments required by GAAP).
