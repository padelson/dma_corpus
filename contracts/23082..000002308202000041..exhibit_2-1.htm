 (a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $.10 per share, of the Company (individually a "Share" and collectively the "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares held in the Company\'s treasury or by any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) each Share held by Parent or Acquisition and (iii) Shares as to which appraisal rights have been perfected under Section 262 of the DGCL) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive (x) $15.00 in cash, unless otherwise increased pursuant to Section 1.8(c) (the "Cash Consideration") and (y) a fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (the "Stock Consideration" and, together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). Unless the context otherwise requires, each reference in this Agreement to shares of Parent Common Stock shall include the associated Parent Rights (as such term is defined in Section 3.2(a) hereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or the Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, then the Exchange Ratio contemplated by the Merger shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares. 

 

 (b) For all purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply: 

 

 (i) "Exchange Ratio" means a fraction the numerator of which is $43.00 and the denominator of which is the Parent Price.

   

 (ii) "Parent Price" means the volume-weighted average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported by Bloomberg, L.P., for the fifteen (15) consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Stockholders Meeting (as defined below); provided, however, that, if the Parent Price, as calculated above, (A) exceeds $38.00, then the Parent Price shall be deemed to be $38.00 or (B) is less than $30.00, then the Parent Price shall be deemed to be $30.00.

 

 (iii) "Share Value" means an amount equal to the sum of (A) the Cash Consideration plus (B) the product of the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Price, as determined pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(ii) (without giving effect to the proviso thereto).

 

 (c) In the event that the Parent Price, as determined pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(ii) (without giving effect to the proviso thereto), is less than $28.00, then Parent may elect to increase the Cash Consideration by an amount such that, after giving effect to such increase, the Share Value will equal $55.00. Parent shall deliver written notice of such an election to the Company by no later than 12:00, Noon (Los Angeles time), on the day immediately preceding the date of the Stockholders Meeting. Prior to such time and, if Parent notifies the Company that it has elected to exercise its right under this Section 1.8(c), following such notification, the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii).

 

 (d) At the Effective Time, the 100% membership interests in Acquisition held by Parent shall be converted into 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

 (e) At the Effective Time, each Share held in the treasury of the Company or held by any of its Subsidiaries and each Share held by Parent or Acquisition immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition or the Company, be canceled, retired and cease to exist and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

 

 Section 1.9. _Appraisal Rights_. Holders of Shares who have complied with all requirements for demanding and perfecting appraisal rights as set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shareholders") are entitled to their rights under such laws. Each Share held by Dissenting Shareholders shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth above. Dissenting Shareholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Each Share held by holders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth above, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided herein, of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any assertions of appraisal rights or withdrawals of assertions of appraisal rights, and any other instrument in respect thereof received by the Company and the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except as 

   

required by Applicable Law or with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

 

Section 1.10. Exchange of Certificates.

 

 (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C., or, following consultation with the Company, such other agent or agents (the "Exchange Agent") as may be appointed by Parent and Acquisition, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article 1, through the Exchange Agent: (i) an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration with respect to each Share, (ii) certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the aggregate amount of the Stock Consideration and (iii) cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock and such cash are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 1.8 in exchange for outstanding Shares. 

 

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") whose Shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for each Share evidenced thereby (x) the Cash Consideration, (y) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration and (z) if applicable, a check representing the cash consideration to which such holder may be entitled on account of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 1, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.10, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent also shall mail a letter of transmittal to each record holder of uncertificated Shares held in book-entry form, as evidenced on the Company\'s stock ledger as of the Effective Time ("Uncertificated Shares"). Any Uncertificated Shares (other than Uncertificated Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders) shall be deemed surrendered to the Exchange Agent at the Effective Time. Upon delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal, each record holder of Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Uncertificated Share, without any other action on the part of such holder. The Company acknowledges and agrees that Parent, Acquisition and the Surviving Corporation shall 

   

rely solely on the stock ledger of the Company as of the Effective Time for
purposes of determining the record holders of Uncertificated Shares and that
none of Parent, Acquisition or the Surviving Corporation shall have any
liability or obligation to pay Merger Consideration to any person other than
holders of certificated Shares and the record holders of Uncertificated
Shares, in each case, in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

 (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.10(f) until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.10(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

 

 (d) In the event that any Certificate for Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent or the Exchange Agent, may, in its discretion, require the delivery of a suitable bond and/or indemnity. 

 

 (e) The Merger Consideration paid to the holders of Shares upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.10(c) or 1.10(f)) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date hereof and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 1. 

 

 (f) No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall, upon surrender of his or her Certificate or Certificates, be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the Parent Price, as determined pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(ii) (without giving effect to the proviso thereto), by the fractional share interest (rounded down to the nearest hundredth) to which such holder would 

   

otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately
bargained for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that
would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

 

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (or any interest or other income earned thereon) which remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 1 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration and any applicable dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, without interest thereon.

 

 (h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.10(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

 

 (i) Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares, or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

 

 (j) Any amounts remaining in the Exchange Fund that are unclaimed by holders of Shares three (3) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

 Section 1.11. _Stock Options and Deferred Restricted Stock_.

 

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary, including obtaining the consent of the individual option holders, to provide for the cancellation, effective at the Effective Time, of all the outstanding Company Stock Options (as defined in Section 2.5(a)), whether vested or unvested, without any payment therefor except as otherwise provided for herein. In consideration for the cancellation of each Company Stock Option, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to the holder thereof an amount in cash equal to the excess (if any) of (x) the Share Value over (y) the aggregate exercise price, if any, of such Company Stock Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Option Consideration"); provided, however, that if the Parent Price, as determined pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(ii) (without giving effect to the proviso thereto), is less than $28.00 and Parent exercises its right under Section 1.8(c), then, for purposes of this Section 1.11(a), the Share Value shall be $55.00. Any payment made hereunder shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. 

 

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, each award with respect to Deferred Restricted Stock (as defined in Section 2.5(a)) that has been granted by the Company under a Company Stock Plan (as defined herein) shall become fully vested and the holder thereof shall 

   

be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration as if the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of such award were issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 

 (c) As of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Plans shall terminate and all rights under any provision of any other plan, program, or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be cancelled. At and after the Effective Time, no person shall have any right under the Company Stock Options or Deferred Restricted Stock or the Company Stock Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement with respect to equity securities of the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof, except the right to receive the Option Consideration or Merger Consideration, as described above. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents to ensure that, after the Effective Time, holders of Company Stock Options will have no rights with respect thereto other than the rights to receive the Option Consideration in cancellation and settlement thereof. 

 

 Section 1.12. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any person pursuant to this Article 1 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law, including any withholding from any payment that is treated as wages or compensation for the performance of services. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares or Company Stock Rights in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

 

 Section 1.13. _Income Tax Treatment_. The parties hereto intend that the Merger and the payment of the Merger Consideration be treated as a taxable purchase of the Shares by Parent, and not as a "reorganization" (as defined in Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) or other nontaxable or tax deferred transaction, for federal income tax purposes.

 

ARTICLE 2

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition that:

 

 Section 2.1. _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties and assets owned or leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined). The Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its minute books and its certificate of incorporation and 

   

bylaws, which are in full force and effect as of the date hereof, and no other
organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon the Company. As
used herein, "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any event,
circumstance, change or effect, individually or in the aggregate, that has had
or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business,
operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or other) or operating
results of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the
ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement;
provided that (x) changes in the general economy or in the financial markets
and (y) any change, circumstance or event contemplated by this Agreement,
shall not, in and of themselves, constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Company Material Adverse
Effect shall include any event, circumstance, change or effect, individually
or in the aggregate, that is reasonably likely to (i) substantially impede the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from (A) entering into
Contracts with the United States government or any department or agency
thereof or (B) obtaining or retaining any security clearances reasonably
necessary for the performance of existing material Contracts with the United
States government or any department or agency thereof, or (ii) result in the
suspension or debarment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the
United States government or any department or agency thereof.

 

 Section 2.2. _Subsidiaries_. 

 

 (a) Schedule 2.2(a) sets forth the name, jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and capitalization of each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) and Joint Ventures (as hereinafter defined), including the interest of the Company and its Subsidiaries therein. Other than as set forth in Schedule 2.2(b), the Company does not own of record or beneficially, directly or indirectly, (i) any shares of outstanding capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock of any other corporation or (ii) any participating interest in any partnership, joint venture or other similar non-corporate business enterprise. Each Company Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company, each of its Joint Ventures, is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each Company Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company, each of its Joint Ventures, is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties and assets owned or leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent and Acquisition complete and correct copies of the minute books and the charter and bylaws (or other organizational documents) of all of its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures, which organizational documents are in full force and effect as of the date hereof, and no other organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon such Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures.

 

 (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.2(b), all the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each Company Subsidiary and Joint Venture that are owned by the Company or by a Subsidiary of the Company are validly issued or granted and, with respect to corporations or limited liability companies, fully paid and nonassessable (and no 

   

such shares have been issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights)
and are owned by the Company or by a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company,
free and clear of any liens, claims, charges, encumbrances or adverse claims
("Liens"), and there are no proxies outstanding or restrictions on voting with
respect to any such shares.

 

 For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term "Subsidiary" shall mean, with respect to any person, any corporation or other entity (including partnerships, limited liability companies and other business associations and joint ventures) in which securities or other ownership interests having ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar functions are at the time owned by such person and/or one or more other of its Subsidiaries and (ii) the term "Joint Venture" shall mean, with respect to any person, any corporation or other entity (including partnerships, limited liability companies and other business associations and joint ventures) in which such person, directly or indirectly, owns an equity interest that does not have voting power under ordinary circumstances to elect a majority of the board of directors or other person performing similar functions; provided, however, that the term "Joint Venture" shall not include the corporations or other entities set forth on Schedule 2.2(b) (collectively, the "Immaterial Joint Ventures").

 

 (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures owns, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5%) of the capital stock of any Immaterial Joint Venture or has the voting power under ordinary circumstances to elect a majority of the board of directors or other person performing similar functions of any Immaterial Joint Venture. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures is a general partner or managing member of any Immaterial Joint Venture. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures has entered into any commitment or agreement, or is otherwise obligated, to contribute capital, loan money or otherwise provide funds or make additional investments in any Immaterial Joint Venture or has a capital account with respect to any Immaterial Joint Venture in excess of $25,000. 

 

 Section 2.3. _Authority Relative to this Agreement; Recommendation_.

 

 (a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except, with respect to consummation of the Merger, the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Stockholder Approval"). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery thereof by Parent and Acquisition, constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except (i) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and (ii) the availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunctive or other forms of equitable 

   

relief may be subject to equitable defenses and would be subject to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

 

 (b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement. The Stockholder Approval is the only vote of any class or series of the Company\'s capital stock necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Section 203 of the DGCL nor any other state takeover statute is applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, amended the bylaws of the Company to render the "right of first refusal provision" of the Company\'s bylaws inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 Section 2.4. _Noncontravention; Consents and Approvals_. 

 

 (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (i) conflict with any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures; (ii) except as set forth on Schedule 2.4(a), result (with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both) in any violation of or default or loss of a benefit under, or permit the acceleration or termination of any obligation under, any mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement or other instrument, permit, concession, grant, franchise or license; (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 2.4(b), violate any rule, regulation, statute, ordinance, guideline, code or other legally enforceable requirement (including common law) applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures or any of their respective properties ("Applicable Law") or any charge, order, writ, injunction, judgment, decree, ruling, determination, directive, award or settlement, whether civil, criminal or administrative and whether formal or informal ("Judgment"), applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures currently in effect; or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iv) above, such as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

 

 (b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or declaration, registration or filing with, or notice to, any nation or government or multinational body, any state, agency, commission or other political subdivision thereof or any entity (including a court) exercising executive, legislative, judicial or administration functions of or pertaining to government ("Governmental Entity") is required to be made or obtained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) compliance by the Company with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") or similar statutes or regulations of foreign jurisdictions, (ii) the filing of the Merger Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, (iii) the filing with the SEC of (1) the Proxy Statement in definitive form for distribution to the stockholders of the Company in advance of the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act and (2) such reports under and such other compliance with the Exchange Act and Securities Act and the rules and 

   

regulations thereunder as may be required in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) such consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as are listed
on Schedule 2.4(b) and (v) such consents, approvals, orders or authorizations
which if not obtained, or registrations, declarations or filings which if not
made, would not materially adversely affect the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the ability of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to conduct its business after
the Effective Time substantially as currently conducted by the Company or such
Subsidiary.

 Section 3.1. _Organization; Qualification_. Each of Parent and Acquisition is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent has heretofore made available to the Company accurate and complete copies of the articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect, of Parent and Acquisition. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As used herein, "Parent Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any event, circumstance, change or effect, individually or in the aggregate, that has had or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or other) or operating results of Parent or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement; provided that (x) changes in the general economy or in the financial markets and (y) any change, circumstance or event contemplated by this Agreement, shall not, in and of themselves, constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Parent Material Adverse Effect shall include any event, circumstance, change or effect, individually or in the aggregate, that is reasonably likely to (i) substantially impede Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from (A) entering into Contracts with the United States government or any department or agency thereof or (B) obtaining or retaining any security clearances reasonably 

   

necessary for the performance of existing material Contracts with the United
States government or any department or agency thereof, or (ii) result in the

 (a) Parent has filed all required forms, reports and documents with the SEC since April 3, 1999, each of which, as amended, has complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, each as in effect on the dates such forms, reports and documents were filed. Parent has heretofore delivered to the Company, in the form filed with the SEC (including any amendments thereto but excluding any exhibits), (i) its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000, March 30, 2001, and March 29, 2002, (ii) all definitive proxy statements relating to Parent\'s meetings of stockholders (whether annual or special) held since April 3, 1999 and (iii) all other reports or registration statements filed by Parent with the SEC since April 3, 1999 (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Parent SEC Filings"). None of such Parent SEC Filings, including, without limitation, any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, contained, when filed, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact 

   

required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial
statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Filings fairly present, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as
of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and changes
in financial position for the periods then ended, subject, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, to year-end adjustments (which consist
of normal recurring accruals) and the absence of certain footnote disclosures.

 

 (b) Parent has heretofore made available or promptly will make available to the Company a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which are required to be filed with the SEC but have not yet been filed with the SEC, to agreements, documents or other instruments which previously have been filed by Parent with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. 

 

 Section 3.6. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Acquisition for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date mailed to Company stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

 

 Section 3.7. _No Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Changes_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Filings, as of March 29, 2002, none of Parent or its Subsidiaries had any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto) or which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. From March 29, 2002 through the date hereof, none of Parent or its subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, which could reasonably be expected to have, and there have been no events, changes or effects with respect to Parent or its subsidiaries having or which could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

that would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has failed to obtain any material licenses, permits,
franchises or other governmental authorizations necessary to the ownership of
its properties or to the conduct of its business (the "Parent Permits"), and,
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, all such

in material violation of any Applicable Law, except for violations or possible
violations that would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 (b) No Violation exists (and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a Violation) of any term, condition or provision of (i) the certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or other organizational documents) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, obligation or commitment, instrument, permit, concession, franchise or license to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is now a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is bound except in the case of (i) and (ii) for Violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

There is no Proceeding pending or, to the best knowledge of Parent, threatened against or affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective properties or rights, before any Governmental Entity or arbitration board or tribunal, either alone or together with other similar actions, the outcome of which would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

both, would constitute a material default and in respect of which the Parent
or such Subsidiary has not taken adequate steps to prevent such a default from
occurring) except where the lack of such good standing, validity and
enforceability, or the existence of such default or event, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent

purposes of this clause (B), the participants of any Company Retirement Plan

Company 401(k) Accounts, and (iv) Stock Consideration that is transferred from
the Company ESOP Accounts to the Company 401(k) Accounts shall be subject to
the rules (including transferability) that specifically govern non-Company
stock investments in the Company 401(k) Accounts, and not the rules that
specifically govern the Company ESOP Accounts. For purposes hereof, "Trigger
Date" means the last day of the first full calendar month ending after the
Closing Date and the last day of each of the first two calendar months ending
thereafter; provided, however, that, if the Closing Date occurs on or before
the 10th day of a calendar month and the record keeper for the Company
Retirement Plans can accommodate the relevant administration and so long as
the associated expenses are not material in the context of the total annual

During the period commencing on the date of the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2003, Parent shall not make any amendments to the Parent Matched Asset Plan that further restrict the rules governing the frequency with which particiipants may transfer Parent stock in the Matched Asset Plan 401(k) accounts between investment funds, or the amount of such transfers, except as may otherwise be required by Applicable Law.

 (iii) subject to Section 1.8(c), if the Parent Price, as determined pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(ii) (without giving effect to the proviso thereto), is less than $28.00.

 (f) by either of Parent or the Company if the Stockholder Approval was not obtained at the Stockholders Meeting; 

 

 Section 6.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent or Acquisition as provided in Section 6.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Acquisition or the Company, other than the provisions of this Section 6.2, Section 4.8(c), Section 6.3 and Article X; provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof. 

   

 Section 6.3. _Fees and Expenses._

 

 (a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:

 

 (i) Section 6.1(d)(i), Section 6.1(e)(i) or Section 6.1(e)(ii); or

 

 (ii) Section 6.1(c), Section 6.1(e)(iii) or Section 6.1(f) and (A) (x) after the date hereof and prior to such termination, a proposal concerning an Alternative Transaction has been publicly announced, disclosed or communicated or submitted to the Company and (y) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company shall consummate or enter into an agreement with respect to any Alternative Transaction or (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company shall consummate or enter into an agreement with respect to any Alternative Transaction with any person that submitted to the Company prior to the date hereof a proposal concerning an Alternative Transaction; 

 

then, in each case, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent,
concurrently with the time of termination in the case of a termination
described in Section 6.3(a)(i) or as promptly as is reasonably practicable
(but in no event later than two business days) in the case of any other
termination described in Section 6.3(a)(ii), an amount (the "Termination Fee")
equal to $25 million. The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent and
Acquisition would suffer direct and substantial damages in the event of any of
the circumstances described in this Section 6.3(a), which damages cannot be
determined with reasonable certainty. It is specifically agreed that the
Termination Fee represents liquidated damages and not a penalty.

 

 (b) Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(b), the Section 6.1(d)(iii) or 6.1(f), in addition to any other remedies that Parent or Acquisition may then or later have as a result of such termination (including receipt of the Termination Fee), the Company shall reimburse Parent, Acquisition and their affiliates (not later than three business days after submission of statements therefor) for all documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, financing fees, fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other advisors, filling fees and printing expenses up to a maximum of (i) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii), $3 million or (ii) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(f), $6 million, which amount shall be credited against the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 6.3(a), if any.

 

 (c) Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(ii), Parent shall reimburse the Company and its affiliates (not later than three business days after submission of statements therefor) for all documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, financing fees, fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other advisors, filling fees and printing expenses up to a maximum of $6 million.

 

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 6.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails 

   

to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 6.3, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the fee or fees and expenses set forth in
this Section 6.3, the Company shall also pay to Parent its costs and expenses
incurred in connection with such litigation.

 

 Section 6.4. _Amendment; Extension; Waiver_. 

 

 (a) This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the Company, Parent and Acquisition at any time before or after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which requires the approval of such stockholders under Applicable Law without such approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto. 

 

 (b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

 

ARTICLE 7

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

 Section 7.1. _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties made herein shall not survive beyond the Effective Time or a termination of this Agreement, provided that any remedy available to any party prior to the Effective Time based on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after execution of this Agreement, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. This Section 7.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto which by its terms requires performance after the Effective Time.

 

 Section 7.2. _Expenses_. 

 

 (a) Subject to Section 6.3, in the event that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Acquisition, on the other hand, shall have any obligation to pay any of the fees and expenses of the other incident to the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement, including the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other experts.

 Section 7.4. _Validity_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby and, to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable.

All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given (w) on the date of delivery if delivered personally, or if by facsimile, upon written confirmation of receipt by facsimile, email or otherwise, (x) on the first business day following the date of dispatch if delivered by a recognized next-day courier service, (y) on the earlier of confirmed receipt or the fifth business day following the date of mailing if delivered by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid or (z) upon actual receipt.

[Bidder\'s Address]

 

Attention:

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

 You have requested non-public information concerning DynCorp and/or its subsidiaries, affiliates or divisions (collectively, the "Company") in connection with your consideration of a possible negotiated transaction (the "Transaction") with the Company. You acknowledge that this information is proprietary to the Company and may include trade secrets or other business information which, if disclosed, could harm the Company. In consideration for, and as a condition of, such information being furnished to you and your directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, financial advisors and any representatives of such advisors), representatives and affiliates (collectively, "Representatives"), you agree to treat any and all information concerning the Company which is furnished to you or your Representatives (regardless of the manner in which it is furnished) now or in the future by or on behalf of the Company, together with any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, documents or records containing, referring, relating to, based upon or derived from such information, in whole or in part (collectively, "Evaluation Material") in accordance with the provisions of this letter agreement, and to take or abstain from taking the other actions set forth in this letter agreement.

 

 The term "Evaluation Material" does not include information which you can show by competent proof (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a direct or indirect disclosure by you or your Representatives, (ii) was within your possession on a non-confidential basis prior to its being furnished to you by or on behalf of the Company or (iii) is received from a source other than the Company or any of its Representatives; provided that, in the case of (ii) and (iii) above, the source of such information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Company or to any other party with respect to such information. 

 

 You hereby agree that you and your Representatives will (a) use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction and not for any other purpose, (b) keep the Evaluation Material confidential and (c) not disclose any of the Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever without the prior written consent of the Company; _provided, however,_ that you may disclose any of such information to your Representatives (i) who need to know such information for the sole purpose of evaluating the Transaction, (ii) who are informed by you of 

   

the confidential nature of such information and (iii) who are provided with a
copy of this letter agreement and agree to act in accordance with its terms to
the same extent as if they were parties hereto. You will be responsible for
any breach of this letter agreement by any of your Representatives and you
agree to take all reasonable measures (including, but not limited to, court
proceedings) to restrain your Representatives from disclosure or improper use
of the Evaluation Material.

 

 You and your Representatives agree (except as provided below), without the prior written consent of the Company, not to disclose to any person that the Evaluation Material exists or has been made available to you, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Transaction or any other transaction involving the Company or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto or such discussions or negotiations (including the status thereof); provided, however, that you may make such disclosure if you have the opinion of your outside legal counsel that such disclosure must be made in order for you not to commit a violation of law. The term "person" as used in this letter agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include the media and any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.

 

 In the event that you or any of your Representatives are required by applicable law, regulation or legal process to disclose any of the Evaluation Material, you will promptly notify the Company in writing by facsimile and certified mail so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent you or your Representatives, as the case may be, from honoring a subpoena that seeks discovery of the Evaluation Material if (i) a motion for a protective order, motion to quash and/or other motion filed to prevent the production or disclosure of the Evaluation Material has been denied; provided, however, that you disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which your outside legal counsel advises you is legally required and that you exercise all reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the remainder of the Evaluation Material; or (ii) the Company consents in writing to having the Evaluation Material produced or disclosed pursuant to the subpoena. In no event will you, or any of your Representatives, oppose action by the Company to obtain a protective order or other relief to prevent the disclosure of the Evaluation Material or to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded the Evaluation Material. 

 

 If you determine not to proceed with the Transaction, you will promptly notify the Company of that decision. In that case, or at any time upon the request of the Company for any reason, you will either (i) promptly destroy all copies of the Evaluation Material in your or your Representative\'s possession or (ii) promptly deliver to the Company at your own expense all copies of the Evaluation Material in your and your Representative\'s possession. In addition, you agree promptly to certify to the Company that you have complied with your obligations under this paragraph. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, you and your Representatives will continue to be bound by your obligations hereunder. 

 

 You understand and acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its Representatives make any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material. You agree that neither the Company nor any of its Representatives will have any liability to you or any of your Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material or any errors or omissions therefrom. You further agree that you are not entitled to rely upon the accuracy or completeness of the 

 



   

Evaluation Material and that you will be entitled to rely solely on such
representations and warranties as may be included in any definitive agreement
with respect to the Transaction (the "Definitive Agreement"). The term
"Definitive Agreement" does not include an executed letter of intent or any
other similar written agreement, nor does it include any written or verbal
acceptance of any offer or bid on your part.

 

 You agree that unless and until a Definitive Agreement has been executed and delivered, no contract or agreement providing for a Transaction shall be deemed to exist between you and the Company. Unless and until a Definitive Agreement has been executed and delivered, neither the Company nor you has any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such Transaction by virtue of this letter agreement, or any oral expression with respect to such Transaction, except, in the case of this letter agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The Company reserves the right at any time, in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, to reject any and all proposals made by you or any of your Representatives with regard to a Transaction, terminate discussions and negotiations with you, refuse to provide any further access to and to demand the return of the Evaluation Materials. 

 

 Neither this paragraph nor any other provision in this letter agreement can be waived or amended except by written consent of the Company, which consent shall explicitly make such waiver or amendment. Any attempted waiver or modification in violation of this provision shall be void.

 

 It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.

 

 You acknowledge that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this letter agreement by you or any of your Representatives and you consent to a court of competent jurisdiction entering an order finding that the Company has been irreparably harmed as a result of any such breach and to the granting of injunctive relief without proof of actual damages as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by you of this letter agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Company. In the event of litigation relating to this letter agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final non-appealable order that you or any of your Representatives have breached this letter agreement, then you will reimburse the Company for the reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with enforcing its rights hereunder, including any appeal therefrom.

 

 This letter agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of or related to this letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [New York], without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied because of the conflicts of laws principles of the State of [New York].

 

 You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of [New York] and of the United States of America located in the City and County of [New York] for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or 

   

relating to this letter agreement and agree (i) not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts, (ii) to waive any
defenses as to personal jurisdiction of such courts over you and (iii) that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
your address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any
action, suit or proceeding brought against you in any such court. You hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this letter agreement in the
courts of the State of [New York] or the United States of America located in
the City and County of [New York] and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

 

 The provisions of this letter agreement shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 

 This letter agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and each of such counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

 

 Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning one copy of this letter to the undersigned, whereupon this letter agreement shall become a binding agreement between you and the Company.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

 The undersigned has been advised that as of the date hereof, the undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of DynCorp, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), as such term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") dated as of December 13, 2002, among Computer Sciences Corporation (" _Parent_ "), the Company, Garden Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Acquisition_ "), pursuant to which Acquisition will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a subsidiary of Parent. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

 

 In consideration of the agreements contained herein, Parent\'s and Acquisition\'s reliance on this letter in connection with the consummation of the Merger and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the undersigned hereby represents, warrants and agrees that the undersigned will not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any shares of common stock of Parent, par value $1.00 per share, (collectively, the " _Parent Stock_ "), or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Parent Stock, if such sale, transfer or other disposition is in violation of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of the shares of Parent Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement has been registered with the SEC under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-4, as amended from time to time. The undersigned has also been advised, however, that because the undersigned may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company at the time the Merger is submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the Company, the Parent Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger Agreement may be disposed of by the undersigned only (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act or (iii) in reliance upon an exemption from registration that is available under the Securities Act.

 

 The undersigned also understands that instructions will be given to Parent\'s transfer agent with respect to the Parent Stock to be received by the undersigned in connection with the Merger and that there may be placed on the certificates representing such Parent Stock, or any substitutes therefor, a legend stating in substance as follows:

   

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN A
TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, APPLIES AND MAY ONLY BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND
COMPUTER SCIENCES CORPORATION, A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE
PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF COMPUTER SCIENCES CORPORATION."

 

 It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth above shall be removed upon surrender of certificates bearing such legend by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to Parent an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that (a) the sale, transfer or other disposition of the securities represented by the surrendered certificates may be effected without registration of the offering, sale and delivery of the securities under the Securities Act and (b) the securities to be so sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of may be publicly offered, sold and delivered by the transferee thereof without compliance with the registration provisions of the Securities Act.

 

 The undersigned further understands and agrees that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent Stock by the undersigned or on the undersigned\'s behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

 

 Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the undersigned\'s part that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter, or as a waiver of any rights the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an "affiliate" on or after the date of this letter.

 

 This letter agreement constitutes the complete understanding between Parent and the undersigned concerning the subject matter hereof. The undersigned acknowledges having carefully reviewed this letter agreement and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed upon the sale, transfer or other disposition of Company stock and Parent Stock. Any notice required to be sent to either party hereunder shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, using the addresses set forth herein or such other address as shall be furnished in writing by the parties. This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware.
