AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this
"Agreement"), dated March 10, 2019, is by and among NVIDIA International
Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Teal Barvaz Ltd., a company
organized under the laws of the State of Israel and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Merger Sub"), NVIDIA Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Guarantor"), and Mellanox Technologies, Ltd, a company organized under the
laws of the State of Israel (the "Company"). All capitalized terms used in
this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in Section 9.5
or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement unless the context clearly
provides otherwise. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are each sometimes
referred to herein as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Parties wish to effect a merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company, with the Company being the surviving entity (the "Merger") on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 314â€‘327 of the Companies Law
5759-1999 of the State of Israel (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "ICL"), following which Merger Sub will cease to
exist, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, each ordinary share, par value NIS
0.0175 per share, of the Company (the "Company Shares") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the ICL;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board of
Directors") has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger (the "Transactions"), are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its shareholders and that, considering the
financial position of the merging companies, no reasonable concern exists that
the Surviving Company will be unable to fulfill the obligations of the Company
to its creditors;

WHEREAS, the Company Board of Directors has adopted resolutions approving the
Merger, the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions and recommending that the Company's shareholders approve the
Merger, this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions (the "Company
Board Recommendation");

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent (the "Parent Board of Directors")
has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, determined
that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in the best
interests of, Parent and its stockholders;



WHEREAS, the Parent Board of Directors has adopted resolutions approving the
Merger, the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Board of
Directors") has, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
(i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in
the best interests of, Merger Sub and its sole shareholder, (ii) approved the
Merger, the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, (iii) determined that, considering the financial position of the
merging companies, no reasonable concern exists that the Surviving Company
will be unable to fulfill the obligations of Merger Sub to its creditors and
(iv) resolved to recommend that the sole shareholder of Merger Sub approve the
Merger, this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions;

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
following the recommendation of the Merger Sub Board of Directors, the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub has approved the Merger, the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions;

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as an inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company and an affiliated entity are executing
a voting and support agreement in favor of Parent in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit A; and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also prescribe
various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Parties agree as follows:





AGREEMENT

ARTICLE I.

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the ICL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub (as the target company (Chevrat
Ha'Ya'ad) in the Merger) will be merged with and into the Company (as the
absorbing company (HaChevra Ha'Koletet) in the Merger), whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub will cease, with the Company surviving the Merger (the
Company, as the surviving entity in the Merger, sometimes being referred to
herein as the "Surviving Company"), such that following the Merger, the
Surviving Company will (a) be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, (b)
continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Israel, and (c) succeed to
and assume all of the rights, properties and obligations of Merger Sub and the
Company in accordance with the ICL.

Section 1.2 Closing. Unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by
the Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 9:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Herzog, Fox and Neeman, Asia
House, 4 Weizman St., Tel Aviv 6423904, Israel, on the third (3rd) Business
Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth
in Article VII to be satisfied or (to the extent permitted) waived (other than
any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted) waiver of such
conditions at the Closing), unless another date or place is agreed to in
writing by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually
takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date."

Section 1.3 Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the determination of
the date on which the Closing is to take place, each of the Company and Merger
Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), in coordination with each
other, deliver to the Companies Registrar of the Israeli Corporations
Authority (the "Companies Registrar") a notice (the "Merger Notice") of the
contemplated Merger and the proposed date on which the Companies Registrar is
requested to issue a certificate evidencing the Merger in accordance with
Section 323(5) of the ICL (the "Certificate of Merger") after notice that the
Closing has occurred is served to the Companies Registrar, which the Parties
shall deliver promptly following the Closing. The Merger will become effective
upon the issuance by the Companies Registrar of the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with Section 323(5) of the ICL (the time at which the Merger
becomes effective is referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

Section 1.4 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in the ICL and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, by virtue of, and
simultaneously with, the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company Shareholder, (a) Merger



Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving
Company, (b) all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, (c) all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, and (d) all the rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company (as the Surviving
Company) shall continue unaffected by the Merger in accordance with the ICL.

Section 1.5 Articles of Association. Subject to Section 6.4, at the Effective
Time, the articles of association of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of association of the
Surviving Company, until such articles of association are thereafter duly
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.6 Officers and Directors of the Surviving Company. The Parties shall
take all actions necessary so that from and after the Effective Time, the
individuals designated by Parent no later than ten (10) days prior to the
Closing Date shall become the officers and directors of the Surviving Company,
until their respective successors have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the articles of association of the Surviving Company.

ARTICLE II.

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 Treatment of Securities.

(a) Treatment of Company Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of any
securities of the Company or of Merger Sub, subject to Section 2.1(d) and
except as provided in Section 2.1(b), each Company Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Shares
to remain outstanding in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be deemed to
have been transferred to Parent in exchange for the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to $125.00 (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"), in each case,
payable as provided in Section 2.2. From and after the Effective Time, (a)
except as provided in Section 2.1(b), the holders of all Company Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all
uncertificated Company Shares represented by book-entry form ("Book-Entry
Shares") and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented any such Company Shares (each, a "Certificate")) shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration applicable to such Company Shares, and (b) the
share transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all
Company Shares outstanding and no further transfer of any such Company Shares
shall be made on such share transfer books after the Effective Time.

(b) Company Shares held by Company, Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub.
At the Effective Time, all Company Shares owned by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, Parent, Merger Sub or by any of their respective Subsidiaries or
held in the Company's treasury shall remain outstanding and no Per Share
Merger Consideration or any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(c) Treatment of Merger Sub Share Capital. At the Effective Time, each
ordinary share, par value one (1) Israeli Agora (NIS 0.01) per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically and without further action



converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
ordinary share, par value NIS 0.0175 per share, of the Surviving Company and
all such ordinary shares shall constitute the only outstanding share capital
of the Surviving Company. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, evidence ownership of such shares of Surviving Company.

(d) Adjustment. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for Company Shares shall occur as a result of any merger, business
combination, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any share dividend or share distribution with a record date
during such period, the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and
any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to reflect such change; provided that nothing in this Section
2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.2 Payment for Company Shares; Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Payments with respect to Company Shares (other than Section 102 Shares).
On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall (i) designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange Agent") and (ii)
to the extent necessary in light of the provisions of the Withholding Tax
Ruling, an information agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Information Agent") to assist in obtaining any requisite residency
certificate and/or other declaration for Israeli Tax withholding purposes
and/or a Valid Tax Certificate, as applicable, and, in connection therewith,
shall enter into agreements with the Exchange Agent and the Information Agent
in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company. The Exchange Agent shall
also act as the agent for the holders of Company Shares for the purpose of
receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall
obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At the
Closing, Parent or Merger Sub shall initiate, or shall cause to be initiated,
a wire transfer to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent,
cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate amount of Per Share Merger Consideration (other than consideration
to be paid with respect to Section 102 Shares, which payment shall be
substantially concurrently transferred directly to the 102 Trustee) (the
"Exchange Fund"), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of



Company Shares (other than the holders of Section 102 Shares), which funds
shall be deposited with the Exchange Agent in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the Effective Time. In the event that the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate amount of all Per Share Merger
Consideration due to the Company Shareholders (other than the holders of
Section 102 Shares), Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration
out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment or
loss thereon shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the
payments required by this Agreement, including the obligation to deposit
additional funds with the Exchange Agent to cover any deficiency in the
Exchange Fund, nor shall it affect the amounts payable to holders of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to this Article II. Upon release of
the Exchange Fund to Parent, or Parent's earlier request, any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent or the
Surviving Company (at the election of Parent) which shall bear, in either
case, any taxes applicable in connection with any such interest or other
income.

(b) Payments with respect to Section 102 Shares. At the Closing, Parent or
Merger Sub shall initiate, or shall cause to be initiated, a wire transfer to
deposit the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable with respect to
the Section 102 Shares to the 102 Trustee, on behalf of holders of Section 102
Shares, in accordance with Section 102 and the Options Tax Ruling, if obtained
(the "Section 102 Share Consideration"), which funds shall be deposited with
the 102 trustee in any event within two (2) Business Days after the Effective
Time. The Section 102 Share Consideration shall be held in trust by the 102
Trustee pursuant to the applicable provisions of Section 102 and the Options
Tax Ruling, if obtained, and shall be released by the 102 Trustee, together
with any interest earned thereon by virtue of the investment of such amounts
by the 102 Trustee, in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 102
and the Options Tax Ruling, if obtained.

(c) Procedures for Surrender. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share as of the Effective Time and whose Company Shares were exchanged
pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such customary form as Parent may reasonably
specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(e)) or Book-
Entry Share in exchange



for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, and
(iii) a declaration and/or Valid Tax Certificate (or such other forms as are
required under any applicable Tax Law) in which the beneficial owner of a
Company Share provides certain information necessary for Parent or the
Exchange Agent or the Information Agent, as applicable, to determine whether
any amounts need to be withheld from the consideration payable to such
beneficial owner hereunder pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance (in each
case, subject to the terms of the Withholding Tax Ruling, if obtained, the
Code, or any provision of applicable Law). Subject to the Withholding Tax
Ruling, upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal and declaration for Tax withholding purposes
and/or a Valid Tax Certificate (or such other forms as are required under any
applicable Tax Law), in each case, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the respective instructions thereto, Parent shall pay or cause
the Exchange Agent to pay to the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in exchange therefor the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II for each Company Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, promptly (subject to the
delay of up to three hundred sixty-five days contemplated by Section 2.4)
following the later to occur of (x) the Effective Time or (y) the Exchange
Agent's receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Share and Valid Tax Certificate, and
the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Share upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such
Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to a Book-Entry Share
shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Share is
registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Per Share
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest
thereon.

(d) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share



outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to the Company Shares represented thereby except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Company
for any reason, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. Unless otherwise determined in
the Withholding Tax Ruling, at any time following twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto)
remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which
disbursement is pending subject only to the Exchange Agent's routine
administrative procedures, to holders of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Company and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Per Share
Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their Certificate or Book-
Entry Share and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b) (with Parent
acting as the Exchange Agent), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share for any Per Share Merger Consideration, dividends, or other amounts
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar applicable Law.

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue or cause the
Exchange Agent to issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof (such affidavit to be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
the Exchange Agent), the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof; provided, however, that Parent or the
Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to deliver a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent with respect to
the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Equity Awards and Company ESPP.

(a) Company Options. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company
Shares granted by the Company (a "Company Option") that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder
of such Company Option or any other Person, will be cancelled and converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive from the Surviving Company an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Company



Shares subject to such Company Option, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price under
such Company Option (the "Option Consideration"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the
Effective Time with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater
than the Per Share Merger Consideration, if any, will, as of the Effective
Time, be canceled without the payment of any consideration therefor.

(b) Cashed-Out Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and either (i) has fully
vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its
terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement, but has not been settled in
Company Shares prior to the Effective Time or (ii) is held by a member of the
Company Board of Directors that is not an employee of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary (whether vested or unvested) (each, a "Cashed-Out Company RSU"),
shall without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
holder of such Company RSU or any other Person, be canceled and converted at
the Effective Time into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving
Company immediately following the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company RSU,
and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(c) Assumed Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not a Cashed-Out
Company RSU will be assumed by Guarantor and converted automatically at the
Effective Time into a restricted stock unit covering common shares of
Guarantor having, except to the extent required to be modified under
applicable Laws, substantially the same terms and conditions as the Company
RSU, including the applicable vesting schedule and payment timing as in effect
on the date of this Agreement (each, an "Assumed RSU"), except that (i) each
such Assumed RSU will entitle the holder, upon settlement, to that number of
whole common shares of Guarantor equal to the product of (A) the number of
Company Shares that were issuable with regard to such Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) a fraction (such ratio, the
"Exchange Ratio"), the numerator of which is the Per Share Merger
Consideration and the denominator of which is the volume weighted average
price for a common share of Guarantor on NASDAQ, calculated to four decimal
places and determined without regard to after-hours trading or any other
trading outside of the regular trading session trading hours, for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days ending on the third complete trading day prior to
(and excluding) the Closing Date, as reported by Bloomberg, L.P., and rounding
such product down to the nearest whole number of common shares of Guarantor,
and (ii) all references to the "Company" in the applicable Company Equity
Plans and the Company RSU award agreements will be references to Guarantor.

(d) Assumed Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, the level at which the
performance goals are satisfied with respect to each Company PSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be determined by the
Compensation Committee



of the Company Board of Directors and approved by the Company Board of
Directors in accordance with its terms, which number shall equal the greater
of (i) the target number of Company PSUs set forth in the applicable Company
PSU grant notice and (ii) such number determined based on the Company's actual
achievement of the applicable performance goals as of the Closing Date
(determined in accordance with the applicable Company PSU award agreement) and
as reasonably agreed to by Parent (such final amount, the "Performance
Satisfied PSUs"). The resulting Performance Satisfied PSUs shall be assumed by
Guarantor and converted automatically at the Effective Time into a restricted
stock unit covering common shares of Guarantor having, except to the extent
required to be modified under applicable Laws, substantially the same terms
and conditions as the Company PSU, other than the performance goals, including
the applicable time-based vesting schedule as in effect on the date of this
Agreement (each, an "Assumed PSU"), except that (A) each such Assumed PSU
shall entitle the holder, upon settlement, to that number of whole common
shares of Guarantor equal to the product of (x) the number of Company Shares
that were issuable with regard to the Performance Satisfied PSUs, multiplied
by (y) the Exchange Ratio, and (B) all references to the "Company" in the
applicable Company Equity Plans and the Company PSU award agreements shall be
references to Guarantor.

(e) Company ESPP. With respect to the Company ESPP, the Company will take all
actions reasonably necessary to provide that:

(i) on a date determined by the Company Board of Directors that is no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding
"Offering Period" (as defined in the Company ESPP) that is in progress on such
date shall terminate and be the final Offering Period under the Company ESPP;

(ii) the accumulated payroll deductions of each participant under the Company
ESPP will be used to purchase Company Shares on the earlier of (x) the
scheduled purchase date for the final Offering Period and (y) the date that is
not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective Time (with any
participant payroll contributions not applied to the purchase of shares
returned to the participant) (the "Final Purchase Date"); and

(iii) the Company ESPP shall terminate as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Any Company Shares acquired under the Company ESPP prior to or
on the Final Purchase Date will be treated as outstanding Company Shares for
purposes of Section 2.1.



(f) Payments with respect to Company Options and Cashed-Out Company RSUs.
Promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause:

(i) the transfer of the aggregate amount of funds payable with respect to
Company Options and Cashed-Out Company RSUs that are Section 102 Awards to the
102 Trustee, on behalf of holders of Section 102 Awards, in accordance with
Section 102 and the Options Tax Ruling, if obtained (the "Section 102 Award
Consideration"). The Section 102 Award Consideration shall be held in trust by
the 102 Trustee pursuant to the applicable provisions of Section 102 and the
Options Tax Ruling, if obtained, and shall be released by the 102 Trustee,
together with any interest earned thereon by virtue of the investment of such
amounts by the 102 Trustee, in accordance with the terms and conditions of
Section 102 and the Options Tax Ruling, if obtained; and

(ii) the deposit of the aggregate amount of funds payable with respect to
Company Options and Cashed-Out Company RSUs (in each case, other than Section
102 Awards) with the Company at one or more accounts designated by the Company
prior to Closing for the benefit of the holders of Company Options and Cashed-
Out Company RSUs (in each case, other than Section 102 Awards), which amounts
shall be paid by the Company to the respective holders thereof through the
Company's payroll systems, subject to applicable withholdings, promptly
following the Closing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Company Option or Cashed-
Out Company RSU is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the payment of the
amount of cash with respect thereto shall be delayed and paid in accordance
with the timing requirements of the definitive grant agreement related to such
award, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

(g) Parties' Obligations. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company, Merger Sub, Guarantor and Parent will take all
actions and adopt such resolutions as may be required to provide for the
treatment of the Company Equity Awards and outstanding purchase rights under
the Company ESPP in the manner contemplated by this Section 2.3. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company will cause resolutions to be adopted in
respect of the Company RSUs and Company PSUs that acknowledge that Section
2.3(c) and Section 2.3(d) provide for an assumption or substitution of the
Company RSUs and the Company PSUs in accordance with Section 11.2 of the
Company's Third Amended and Restated Global Share Incentive Plan (2006).

(h) Parent's Obligations. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company
to, make the payments due under Section 2.3 and Parent shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that, if applicable, the Surviving Company and the 102
Trustee have cash sufficient to satisfy the payment obligations set forth in
this Section 2.3, including, to the extent necessary,



depositing with the Surviving Company and the 102 Trustee the amounts due
under this Section 2.3. Promptly following the Closing Date, Parent will file
an appropriate Registration Statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form
with respect to the offering of common shares of Parent issuable upon vesting
of the Assumed RSUs and Assumed PSUs.

(i) Guarantor Obligations. Promptly following the Closing Date, Guarantor will
file an appropriate Registration Statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate
form with respect to the offering of common shares of Guarantor issuable upon
vesting of the Assumed RSUs and Assumed PSUs and shall file a request with the
Israel Securities Authority for an exemption from prospectus requirements
pursuant to Section 15D of the Israeli Securities Law 1968, with respect to
such offering. Subject to the receipt of the Options Tax Ruling, Guarantor
shall use all reasonable commercial efforts in order to maintain the tax
beneficial treatment of the Assumed RSUs and Assumed PSUs which are Section
102 Awards pursuant to Section 102(b)(3) of the Ordinance. Guarantor shall use
reasonable best efforts to keep such Form S-8 effective for as long as the
Assumed RSUs and Assumed PSUs remain outstanding.

(j) After the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Equity Award or purchase
right under the Company ESPP will have any right to acquire any Company
Shares.

Section 2.4 Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the 102
Trustee, the Exchange Agent and any other third-party paying agent (each a
"Payor") shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be
deducted and withheld, from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement, any amounts that Parent or (if the Withholding Tax Ruling
imposes responsibility for withholding solely on the Exchange Agent) the
Exchange Agent reasonably determine are required to be withheld or deducted
with respect to such consideration under the Withholding Tax Ruling and the
Options Tax Ruling, if obtained, the Code, the Ordinance or any applicable
provisions of Israeli Tax Law or any applicable provision of non-Israeli Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made. Notwithstanding the provisions
of this Agreement relating to the timing of payment of consideration, and
subject to any other provision to the contrary in the Withholding Tax Ruling,
with respect to the payment of consideration that would be subject to
withholding of Israeli Taxes, the consideration otherwise payable to each
Company Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement (other than holders of Section
102 Shares) shall, unless Parent or Exchange Agent is otherwise instructed
explicitly by the ITA, be retained by the Exchange Agent for the benefit of
each such Company Shareholder for a period of up to three hundred and sixty
five (365) days from Closing (the "Withholding Drop Date"), and until the
Withholding Drop Date no Payor shall make any such payments to any Company
Shareholder and withhold any amounts for Israeli Taxes from the payment
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, except as provided below and during
which time each Company Shareholder may seek to obtain a Valid Tax
Certificate. If a Company Shareholder



delivers, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop
Date a declaration for Israeli Tax withholding purposes or a Valid Tax
Certificate to a Payor (or such other forms as are required under any
applicable Tax Law) all in accordance with Section 2.2(c)(iii), then the Per
Share Merger Consideration due to such Company Shareholder shall be paid to
such Company Shareholder, subject to any non-Israeli withholding which is
applicable to the payment, and the deduction and withholding of any Israeli
Taxes shall be made only in accordance with the declaration for Israeli Tax
withholding purposes or the Valid Tax Certificate. Subject to the Withholding
Tax Ruling, if any Company Shareholder (i) does not provide Payor with a
declaration for Israeli Tax withholding purposes or a Valid Tax Certificate
(or such other forms as are required under any applicable Tax Law), by no
later than three (3) Business Days before the Withholding Drop Date, or (ii)
submits a written request with Payor to release such Person's applicable
consideration prior to the Withholding Drop Date but fails to submit a
declaration for Israeli Tax withholding purposes or a Valid Tax Certificate
(or such other forms as are required under any applicable Tax Law) at or
before such time, then the amount to be withheld from such consideration shall
be calculated according to the applicable withholding rate as reasonably
determined by the Parent or (if the Withholding Tax Ruling imposes
responsibility for withholding solely on the Exchange Agent) by the Exchange
Agent. If so provided in the Withholding Tax Ruling, any withholding made in
New Israeli Shekels with respect to payments made hereunder in Dollars shall
be calculated based on a conversion rate on the date the payment is actually
made to any recipient and any currency conversion commissions will be borne by
the applicable payment recipient and deducted from payments to be made to such
payment recipient.

Section 2.5 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, Merger Sub or otherwise,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

being conducted. Merger Sub is a corporation organized and validly existing,

Registrar. Parent and Merger Sub are in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing



necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.2 Charter Documents and Bylaws. Parent has made available to the
Company a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, each as amended to date (the

Charter Documents are in full force and effect. Parent is not in material
violation of any of the provisions of its Charter Documents. Merger Sub has
made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of its Charter
Documents. Such Charter Documents are in full force and effect. Merger Sub is
not in material violation of any of the provisions of its Charter Documents.

authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and

duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other

part of Parent and Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now

(and not negotiate) the material terms of such Competing Proposal for the
purpose of the Company Board of Directors informing itself about the terms of

that neither it, nor its affiliates, will enter into any agreement with any
Third Party subsequent to the date of this Agreement which would prohibit the
Company or any of its affiliates from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this Section 5.2.

(b) The Company shall immediately cease and shall cause the Company

established in connection therewith). Promptly following the date of this
Agreement, the Company will request that each Person (other than Parent and
its Representatives) that has, prior to the date of this Agreement, executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a Competing
Proposal which has not terminated or expired pursuant to its terms to promptly
return or destroy (and certify such destruction in writing) all non-public
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of such confidentiality agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.2(a), if, after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Shareholder Approval being
obtained, the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Competing
Proposal and the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisor
that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, then in either event the
Company and its Representatives may: (i) furnish information (including
nonpublic information) to the Person making such Competing Proposal, its
Representatives and its potential sources of financing, if, and only if, prior
to so furnishing such information, the Company receives (or has previously
received) from such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
covering such Persons; and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person, its Representatives and its potential sources of financing with
respect to such Competing Proposal and any changes thereto, including by
making counterproposals thereto. The Company will promptly provide to Parent
any material nonpublic information concerning the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries provided to any other Person in connection with any Competing
Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent.

(d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than two
(2) Business Days) after, to the knowledge of the Company, the receipt of any
Competing Proposal or any inquiry, indication, request or offer that would be
reasonably expected to lead to a



Competing Proposal, together with the identity of the Person making any such
Competing Proposal inquiry, indication, request or offer, and provide Parent
with a copy of the Competing Proposal, inquiry, indication, request or offer
(or if the Competing Proposal, inquiry, indication, request or offer is not in
writing, a written description of the material terms thereof), together with
any material documents and proposed material terms relating to the financing
thereof, if any. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed on a
prompt basis of the status of discussions relating to any Competing Proposal
inquiry, indication, request or offer, and (ii) promptly provide to Parent
written notice containing copies of correspondence, documents and other
written materials sent by or provided to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their Representatives that describes any financial or other material
terms or conditions of such Competing Proposal, inquiry, indication, request
or offer (together with written summaries of any additional or modified
material terms or conditions conveyed orally to or by the Company).

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2 or Section 5.3 to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make a Company Change of
Recommendation in response to a Company Intervening Event if, and only if, (i)
the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation
with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisor that the
failure to make a Company Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company
Board of Directors to the Company Shareholders under Israeli Law (provided,
however, that in order to determine the appropriate standards that would apply
to such fiduciary duties, the Company Board of Directors may also consider and
act on the basis of the fiduciary duties owed by a board of directors to the
shareholders of a company under Delaware Law); provided, further, that the
actions of the Company Board of Directors solely in making such determination
and such determination shall not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation
or a violation of this Section 5.2, (ii) the Company has provided Parent with
a written notice (a "Company Intervening Event Notice") of such determination,
stating that such notice constitutes a Company Intervening Event Notice,
providing a description of the material facts and circumstances giving rise to
the Company Intervening Event, and that the Company Board of Directors intends
to effect a Company Change of Recommendation (provided, however, that the sole
action of giving such Company Intervening Event Notice and of the Company
Board of Directors in authorizing and disclosing (to the extent legally
required) such Company Intervening Event Notice shall not constitute a Company
Change of Recommendation or a violation of this Section 5.2) and (iii) during
the period commencing on the date of Parent's receipt of the Company
Intervening Event Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m. California time on date that
is the fourth (4th) Business Day thereafter, has made its Representatives
reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in discussions and
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment to this Agreement and has
considered in good faith any proposals made by Parent, and after



taking account of Parent's proposals, if any, the Company Board of Directors
again makes the determination set forth in Section 5.2(e)(i).

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2 or Section 5.3 to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Company Board of Directors may in response to its receipt after
the date of this Agreement of a bona fide written Competing Proposal, make a
Company Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive written agreement providing for such Competing Proposal pursuant to
Section 8.1(h) if, and only if, (i) the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisor that (x) such Competing Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement which may have been offered by Parent prior to the
determination by the Company Board of Directors, and (y) the failure to make
such Company Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members
of the Company Board of Directors to the Company Shareholders under Israeli
Law (provided, however, that in order to determine the appropriate standards
that would apply to such fiduciary duties, the Company Board of Directors may
also consider and act on the basis of the fiduciary duties owed by a board of
directors to the shareholders of a company under Delaware Law); provided,
further, that the actions of the Company Board of Directors solely in making
such determination and such determination shall not constitute a Company
Change of Recommendation, a violation of this Section 5.2 or a termination of
this Agreement, (ii) the Company has provided Parent with a written notice (a
"Company Notice") of such determination, stating that such notice constitutes
a Company Notice, stating whether the Company Board of Directors intends to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation or the Company intends to terminate
this Agreement, and describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such
Company Change of Recommendation or termination (provided, however, that the
sole action of giving such Company Notice and of the Company Board of
Directors in authorizing and disclosing (to the extent legally required) such
Company Notice shall not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation, a
violation of this Section 5.2 or a termination of this Agreement), (iii) the
Company has provided Parent with the material agreements and documents
relating to such Competing Proposal (including the financing thereof), and
(iv) during the period commencing on the date of Parent's receipt of the
Company Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m. California time on date that is the
fourth (4th) Business Day thereafter, the Company has made its Representatives
reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in discussions and
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent desired
to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment to this Agreement and has
considered in good faith any written proposals made by Parent that if accepted
by the Company would be binding upon Parent, and after taking account of
Parent's proposals, if any, the Company Board of Directors again makes the
determination set forth in Section 5.2(f)(i). Following receipt by Parent of a
Company Notice, if the financial or other material terms of such Competing
Proposal are amended prior to the Company Board of Directors making a Company
Change of



Recommendation or terminating this Agreement in accordance with the foregoing
sentence, the Company will deliver to Parent a new Company Notice prior to the
Company Board of Directors making a Company Change of Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement in accordance with the foregoing sentence, provided
that the period of negotiation provided in Section 5.2(f)(iv) shall instead
end at 5:00 p.m. local time in California on the second (2nd) Business Day
immediately following Parent's receipt of such Company Notice, but no such new
Company Notice shall shorten the original five (5) Business Day notice period.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Company Shareholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any communication required under Israeli Law with
substantially similar content) or a position contemplated by Section 329 of
the ICL, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Shareholders if the
Company Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisor
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board of Directors to the
Company Shareholders under Israeli Law (provided, however, that in order to
determine the appropriate standards that would apply to such fiduciary duties,
the Company Board of Directors may also consider and act on the basis of the
fiduciary duties owed by a board of directors to the shareholders of a company
under Delaware Law); provided, further, that any such disclosure referred to
in clauses (i) or (ii) that relates to a Competing Proposal shall be deemed to
be a Company Change of Recommendation unless (x) the Company Board of
Directors expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
disclosure or (y) such disclosure is a "stop, look and listen" communication
to the Company Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(b) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or any communication under Israeli Law with substantially
similar content; provided, further, that this Section 5.2(g) shall not permit
the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Change of Recommendation
except to the extent permitted by Section 5.2(e) or Section 5.2(f).

Section 5.3 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Special Meeting.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and in any event within thirty (30) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement), the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the
Proxy Statement in preliminary form. Each of the Company and Parent shall
furnish all information concerning itself, its affiliates and the holders of
its shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested by such other Party in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement



received from the SEC and advise Parent of any oral comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. The Company shall respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to mailing the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in advance and
include any such reasonable comments in the Proxy Statement, except to the
extent such disclosures relate to a Competing Proposal.

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, is discovered by the Company or Parent that, in the reasonable
judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or
a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the extent
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to the Company Shareholders. Nothing in this Section 5.3(b)
shall limit the obligations of any Party under Section 5.3(a).

(c) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Governing Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, publish the
notice of and schedule the Company Special Meeting (the "Notice Date") as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. Subject
to compliance with applicable Law, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Proxy
Statement is approved, or deemed to have been approved by the SEC for
dissemination to the Company Shareholders in accordance with Rule 14a-6(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, mail the Proxy Statement to the Company
Shareholders and, unless the Company Board of Directors shall have made a
Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.2, use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval. The Company shall comply with the notice requirements applicable to
the Company in respect of the Company Special Meeting pursuant to the ICL and
the regulations promulgated thereunder and the Articles of Association. The
Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the Company Special
Meeting, which, subject to the terms of the next sentence relating to
postponement and adjournment thereof, shall be held no earlier than thirty-
five (35) days, and not later than forty-five (45) days, following the Notice
Date. The Company shall not include any proposals in the Proxy Statement other
than those permitted by this Agreement to be considered at the Company Special
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.3(c), the Company shall not adjourn,
postpone or delay the Company Special Meeting without the prior consent



of Parent, except that it may do so if and to the extent that: (i) there are
holders of an insufficient number of Company Shares present or represented by
a proxy at the Company Special Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company
Special Meeting; (ii) the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Company Shares to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval; (iii) such adjournment, postponement, delay or cancellation is
required by applicable Law or a request from the SEC or its staff; or (iv) in
the good faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors (after consultation
with its outside legal advisors), the failure to adjourn, postpone or delay
the Company Special Meeting would be reasonably likely to not allow sufficient
time under applicable Laws for the distribution of any required or appropriate
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement; provided, however, that
without the prior written consent of Parent, (1) no single such adjournment or
postponement shall be for more than five (5) Business Days and (2) in no event
may the Company Special Meeting be postponed to later than the date that is
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date for which the Company Special
Meeting was originally scheduled. In the event that Parent or any Person
listed in Section 320(c) of the ICL casts any votes in respect of the Merger,
Parent shall disclose to the Company its interest in the Company Shares so
voted. At the Company Special Meeting, Parent and Merger Sub shall disclose to
the Company its interest in the Company Shares so voted. At the Company
Special Meeting, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause any Company Shares owned by
them and their affiliates (if any) to be voted in favor of the approval of the
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
submit this Agreement for approval by at the Company Shareholders at the
Company Special Meeting whether or not a Company Change of Recommendation
shall have occurred or a Competing Proposal shall have been publicly
announced; provided that the Proxy Statement shall include, if applicable, the
disclosure of the Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section
5.2.

Section 5.4 Merger Proposal; Certificate of Merger.

(a) Subject to the ICL, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof,
the Company and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall take the following actions
within the timeframes set forth herein; provided, however, that any such
actions or the timeframe for taking such action shall be subject to any
amendment in the applicable provisions of the ICL (and in case of an amendment
thereto, such amendment shall automatically apply so as to amend this Section
5.4(a) accordingly): (i) the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a merger
proposal (in the Hebrew language) (the "Merger Proposal") to be prepared and
executed in accordance with Section 316 of the ICL; (ii) the Company and
Merger Sub shall deliver the executed Merger Proposal to the Companies
Registrar within three (3) days from the calling of the Company Special
Meeting; (iii) the Company and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall cause a copy
of the Merger Proposal to be delivered to its secured creditors, if any, no
later than three (3) days after the date on which the Merger Proposal is
delivered to the Companies Registrar; (iv) promptly after the Company and
Merger Sub, as applicable, shall have complied with the preceding sentence and
with clauses (A) and (B) of this Section 5.4(a), but in any event no more



than three (3) days following the date on which such notice was sent to the
creditors, the Company and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall inform the
Companies Registrar, in accordance with Section 317(b) of the ICL, that notice
was given to their respective creditors, if any, under Section 318 of the ICL;
(v) each of the Company and, if applicable, Merger Sub, shall: (A) publish a
notice, with respect to subsection (x) to its creditors, stating that a Merger
Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar and that the creditors may
review the Merger Proposal at the office of the Companies Registrar, the
Company's registered office or Merger Sub's registered offices, as applicable,
and at such other locations as the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, may
determine, in (x) two (2) daily Hebrew newspapers, on the day that the Merger
Proposal is submitted to the Companies Registrar, and (y) in a popular
newspaper in New York as may be required by applicable Law, within three (3)
Business Days from the date of submitting the Merger Proposal to the Companies
Registrar; (B) if applicable, within four (4) Business Days from the date of
submitting the Merger Proposal to the Companies Registrar, send a notice by
registered mail to all of the "Substantial Creditors" (as such term is defined
in the Israeli Companies Regulations (Merger) 5760-2000 promulgated under the
ICL) that the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, is aware of, in which it
shall state that a Merger Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar
and that the creditors may review the Merger Proposal at such additional
locations, if such locations were determined in the notice referred to in the
immediately preceding clause (A); and (C) send to the Company's "employees
committee" (Va'ad Ovdim) or display in a prominent place at the Company's
premises a copy of the notice published in a daily Hebrew newspaper (as
referred to in clause (A)(x) of this Section 5.4(a)), no later than three (3)
Business Days following the day on which the Merger Proposal was submitted to
the Companies Registrar; (vi) not later than three (3) days after the date on
which the Company Shareholder Approval is received, the Company shall (in
accordance with Section 317(b) of ICL and the regulations thereunder) inform
the Companies Registrar of such approval; and (vii) subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII
to be satisfied or (to the extent permitted) waived (other than any such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted) waiver of such
conditions at the Closing), in accordance with the customary practice of the
Companies Registrar, the Company and Merger Sub shall request that the
Companies Registrar declare the Merger effective and issue the Certificate of
Merger upon such date as the Company and Merger Sub shall advise the Companies
Registrar. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, it is the intention of the Parties that the
Merger shall be declared effective and the Certificate of Merger shall be
issued on the Closing Date, as a condition to the Closing taking place. For
purposes of this Section 5.4(a), "Business Day" shall have the meaning set
forth in the Israeli Companies Regulations (Merger) 5760-2000 promulgated
under the ICL.

(b) The sole shareholder of Merger Sub has approved the Merger. No later than
three (3) days after the date of such approval, Merger Sub shall (in
accordance with Section



317(b) of the ICL and the regulations thereunder) inform the Companies
Registrar of such approval.

ARTICLE VI.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1 Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice to all of their properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records, and, during such period the Company shall, and shall
cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to
Parent all existing information (financial or otherwise) concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required by this
Section 6.1 to provide Parent or its Representatives with access to or to
disclose information (i) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a Third Party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (ii) the disclosure of which would
reasonably be expected to violate or conflict with any Law, including
Antitrust Laws, or (iii) that is subject to any attorney-client or attorney
work product or other legal privilege; provided for (i) through (iii) that the
Company will inform Parent of the general nature of the document or
information being withheld and reasonably cooperate with Parent to provide
such document or information in a manner that would not result in a violation
of Law or any such contractual restraint or the loss or waiver of such
privilege. Parent will reasonably minimize any disruption to the businesses of
the Company that may result from the requests for access, data and information
hereunder.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 6.1 or as set forth in
Section 6.2, the Company may, as it deems necessary based on the advice of its
outside counsel, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided under this Section 6.1 or under Section 6.2 as either "Antitrust
Counsel Only Material" or "Antitrust Restricted Material." Antitrust Counsel
Only Material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the Company or its legal
counsel. Antitrust Restricted Material and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside antitrust counsel and other outside
Representatives of the recipient and employees, officers or directors of the
recipient approved by the Company based on the advice of its outside counsel,
and will not be disclosed by such Persons to other employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission



is obtained in advance from the Company or its legal counsel. Anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 6.1 or in Section 6.2 notwithstanding,
materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 may be redacted
(i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and the
Merger, and (ii) as reasonably contemplated by Sections 6.1(a)(i), (ii) or
(iii), but subject to the proviso thereof.

(c) Parent will hold, and will cause its Representatives and affiliates to
hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant
to this Section 6.1 or Section 6.2, in confidence to the extent required by
and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Company or
Parent, (ii) of any Action commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company or
the knowledge of Parent, threatened against, such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Transactions, and (iii) upon becoming aware of the
occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively,
which would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the other
Party's obligation to effect the Merger or that would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.1(d) shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring
disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise
limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party.

Section 6.2 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, including (x) prepare and file,
in consultation with the other Party and as promptly as reasonably practicable
and advisable after the date of this Agreement, all documentation to effect
all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents
and to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all waiting period
expirations or terminations, registrations, Permits and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Specified Antitrust Authority
in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other



Transactions and (y) take all steps as may be reasonably necessary to obtain
all waiting period expirations or terminations, registrations, Permits and
authorizations of any Specified Antitrust Authority. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees (i) to make all necessary
applications, notices, petitions and filings required with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions (A) in connection with the pre-merger
notification under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable but in no case later
than ten (10) Business Days after execution of this Agreement, (B) in
connection with the pre-merger notification under the Anti-Monopoly Law of the
People's Republic of China as promptly as reasonably practicable and (C) with
the Specified Antitrust Authorities (other than in the United States and
China) (the foregoing (A) through (C), the "Antitrust Approvals") as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement (in each case,
unless another date is mutually agreed between the Parties), or where the
ability to control timing of the application, notice, petition or filing is
not within the control of the submitting Party, commence pre-submission
consultation procedures for, any applications notices, petitions or filings
with the Specified Antitrust Authorities (and thereafter make any other
required submissions and respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
requests for additional information or documentary material), and (ii) to
promptly determine whether any other filings are required to be made with, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required
to be obtained from, any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law
in connection with the Transactions, and if so, to prepare and file any such
filings and to seek any such other consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations (the filings described in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(ii) collectively, "Regulatory Filings").

(b) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts or the obligations
of the Parties under Section 6.2(a), each of Parent and the Company shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and not prohibited by the applicable
Governmental Authority and subject to all applicable privileges (including the
attorney client privilege), (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the
making of Regulatory Filings (including, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and subject to the provisions of Section 6.1(b), providing copies, or
portions thereof, of all such documents to the non-filing Parties prior to
filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any
investigation, request or other inquiry of any Governmental Authority under
any applicable Law with respect to any such filing, (ii) supply the other with
any information and reasonable assistance that may be required or reasonably
requested in connection with the making of such Regulatory Filings, and (iii)
supply, within the time allowed, any additional or supplemental information
that may be required or reasonably requested by the Federal Trade Commission
(the "FTC"), the DOJ, the Israeli Competition Authority (the "ICA"), the Anti-
Monopoly Bureau of the State Administration for Market Regulation in the
People's Republic of China ("SAMR") and any Specified Antitrust Authority.

(c) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and no later than
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company shall instruct
its Israeli counsel, advisors



and/or accountants to prepare and file with the Investment Center an
application to obtain the Investment Center Approval. Without limiting the
generality of Section 6.2(a) and Section 6.2(b), each of the Company and
Parent shall cause their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants
to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect
to the preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of
any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Investment Center Approval. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best
efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable action and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to obtain the Investment Center Approval, as promptly as
reasonably practicable.

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and the Company Subsidiaries,
if applicable), on the other hand, shall, to the extent practicable and unless
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority and
subject to all applicable privileges (including the attorney client
privilege), promptly inform the other of any material communication from any
Governmental Authority regarding any of the Transactions in connection with
any Regulatory Filings or investigations with, by or before any Governmental
Authority relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, including any
Actions initiated by a private party. If any Party or Subsidiary or other
affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to a
Regulatory Filing, then such Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2(d), to the extent
reasonably practicable and unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Authority, the Parties will (i) give each other
reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Authority
relating to the Merger or any other Transactions, (ii) give each other an
opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) keep the other
Party reasonably apprised with respect to any material communications with any
Governmental Authority regarding the Merger or any other Transactions, (iv)
cooperate in the filing of any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions or other written communications explaining or defending
the Merger or any other Transactions, articulating any regulatory or
competitive argument or responding to requests or objections made by any
Governmental Authority, (v) provide each other with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views
of the other with respect to, all material written communications (including
applications, analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and
opinions) with a Governmental Authority regarding the Merger or any other
Transactions and (vi) provide each other (or counsel of each Party, as
appropriate) with copies of all material written communications to or from any
Governmental Authority relating to the Merger or any other Transactions. Any
such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of information by one
Party to the other may be made on a



counselâ€‘only basis to the extent required under applicable Law and the
provisions of Section 6.1(b). Anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 6.2 notwithstanding, materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.2
may be redacted to remove such information as the Company is not obligated to
provide under Section 6.2(b) and references concerning the valuation of the
Company determined by Parent.

(e) The Parties agree that it is Parent's primary right to devise and
implement the strategy for all filings, notifications, submissions and
communications in connection with any filing, notice, petition, statement,
registration, submission of information, application or similar filing subject
to this Section 6.2 after consulting with, and taking into account in good
faith any comments of, the Company relating to such strategy.

(f) If any Action is instituted challenging any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement as in violation of the HSR Act or any similar Law, the Parties
shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
Action, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to support one another in
contesting and resisting any such Action, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other governmental Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, limits or restricts
consummation of the Transactions, unless the Company and Parent, after good
faith consultation, jointly decide that litigation is not in their respective
best interests.

(g) In furtherance to and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent, the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all lawful actions necessary to obtain
the Antitrust Approvals of the Merger or the Transactions or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods (and any extension thereof) in
connection therewith in order for the Parties to consummate the Transactions
as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the Outside
Date (as the same may be extended), including (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to, and/or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, transfer, license, disposition, or hold
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of the assets,
properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement as are
required to be divested in order to avoid the entry of any lawful decree,
judgment, injunction (permanent or preliminary), or any other lawful Order
that would make the Transactions unlawful or would otherwise materially delay
or prevent the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) terminating, modifying,
or assigning existing relationships, Contracts, or obligations relating to any
assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement,
or (iii) changing or modifying any course of conduct regarding future
operations of the assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to
this Agreement (all such actions referenced in clauses (i) through (iii),
"Antitrust Remedies"); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries shall
not, except as provided on Schedule 6.2(g), be obligated to, and the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries



shall not, without Parent's prior written approval, propose, negotiate, commit
to, effect or undertake any Antitrust Remedies (x) that would reasonably be
anticipated to have a material adverse impact on the business of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole following the Merger, (y) with
respect to the Company's Core Technology, or (z) with respect to the assets,
properties or business of Parent or Parent's Subsidiaries (other than, after
the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries).

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.2, neither
Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand,
shall be required to (and the Company and Company Subsidiaries shall not,
without Parent's prior consent) agree to any term or take or omit to take any
action in connection with obtaining the approval of any Governmental Authority
that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions.

(i) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third
parties (other than Governmental Authorities, which are the subject of clauses
(a)-(h) above) necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and to provide any notices to third parties
required to be provided by them prior to the Effective Time.

Section 6.3 Publicity. Parent and the Company have agreed upon the initial
joint press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement, and will
issue such press release promptly following the execution of this Agreement.
From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor
Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or any public announcement with respect to
the Transactions or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it
is required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing
rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause
the publication of any press release or any public announcement with respect
to the Transactions or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall
endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such
press release or public announcement in advance and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.3, (i)
Parent and the Company may make press releases and other public announcements
concerning this Agreement or the Transactions that consist solely of
information previously disclosed in all material respects in previous press
releases and other public announcements made by Parent and/or the Company in
compliance with this Section 6.3, (ii) Parent and the Company may make public
statements in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences or financial



analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements consist solely of
information previously disclosed in all material respects in previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made by the Company or
Parent in compliance with this Section 6.3 and do not reveal material, non-
public information regarding the other Parties, this Agreement or the
Transactions, (iii) the Company shall not be required to provide any review or
comment to Parent regarding any statement, release or disclosure made by the
Company or its Representatives that does not reveal material, non-public
information regarding the Parties, this Agreement or the Transactions in
response to or in connection with the receipt and existence of a Competing
Proposal, the consideration of making a Company Change of Recommendation or
any matters related thereto, and (iv) Parent shall not be required to provide
any review or comment to the Company regarding any statement, release or
disclosure made by the Parent or its Representatives that does not reveal
material, non-public information regarding the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, this Agreement or the Transactions in response to or in
connection with the Company's receipt and existence of, or disclosure in
relation to, a Competing Proposal, or any matters related thereto.

Section 6.4 Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to) indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors and officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the benefit of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, together with such Persons'
heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, the "Covered Persons") to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, against any costs and expenses (including
advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Covered Person to the
fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened Action or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons
serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity at the
request or for the benefit of the Company). Without limiting the foregoing,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Covered Persons to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the process resulting in and the adoption and approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Company shall advance expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any
Action or investigation with respect to the matters subject to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) in accordance with the procedures (if any) set
forth in the Articles of Association, the certificate



of incorporation and bylaws, or other organizational or governance documents,
of any Company Subsidiary, and indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date of this Agreement. In the event of any such Action or
investigation, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Company shall cooperate
with the Covered Person in the defense of any such Action or investigation.

(b) For not less than seven (7) years from and after the Effective Time, the
articles of association of the Surviving Company and the Charter Documents of
each Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to exculpation, indemnification of and advancement of expenses to
Covered Persons for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are
currently set forth in the Articles of Association and the Charter Documents
of each Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
if any Action or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Covered Person with respect to matters
subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the seventh anniversary of
the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.4(b) shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of such Action or investigation. Following
the Effective Time, the indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on
the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving
Company, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For not less than seven (7) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
maintain for the benefit of the Covered Persons, an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing
policies of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to errors and
omissions of directors and officers or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that
the Surviving Company shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as is
available for such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time (which the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to purchase prior to the Effective Time), which
policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate
period of at least seven (7) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of the Transactions. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain such policies
in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.



(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.

(e) The rights of each Covered Person pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Covered Person
may have (including any indemnification, exculpation or advancement of
expenses rights) under the Articles of Association (or similar documents of
any Company Subsidiary), any Contract (including any indemnification
agreements between the Company or a Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and
the officers and directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary), or under
applicable Law. The provisions of this Section 6.4 shall survive the Effective
Time and shall not be terminated or modified in any manner that is adverse to
the Covered Persons (and their respective successors and assigns), it being
expressly agreed that the Covered Persons (including their respective
successors and assigns) shall be third party beneficiaries of, and entitled to
enforce, this Section 6.4. In the event of any breach by the Surviving Company
or Parent of this Section 6.4, the Surviving Company shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by Covered Persons
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.4
as such fees are incurred upon the written request of such Covered Person.

Section 6.5 Takeover Statutes. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the
other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other Transactions.

Section 6.6 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Company to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, including
the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(iv) the opportunity to participate in applicable health (including health

individual employment, severance, change in control or similar agreement in

Company Subsidiaries or any predecessor of the Company or



a Company Subsidiary) shall be credited for all purposes under all employee
benefit plans maintained by Parent or an affiliate of Parent (including the
Surviving Company) for the benefit of the Continuing Employees, including
vacation or other paid-time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k) or other
retirement plans and any severance or health or welfare plans or benefits
(other than any equity compensation plans and for purposes of determining any

duplication of benefits for the same period of service).

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, with respect to Continuing Employees who reside in the United
States, (i) ensure that no eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work

maximum under any health benefit plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent for
such plan year and (iv) as applicable, credit each such Continuing Employee
with his or her contribution balances, if any, under the health savings
accounts, flexible spending accounts and dependent care spending accounts
administered under Company Plans which contributions are made during the
Company Plan year in which the Closing occurs.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or
any affiliate of Parent, and nothing in this Agreement shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any
affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any
reason whatsoever, with or without cause, subject to the terms of applicable
Law. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
in this Section 6.7 shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or
other modification of any Company Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent
or any of its affiliates or (ii) create any third-party rights in any current
or former employee or individual independent contractor of the Company or its
affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 6.8 401(k) Plans. If requested by Parent at least ten (10) days prior
to the Closing, then effective as of no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing, the



Company will terminate each of the Company Plans intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the "Company 401(k) Plans").
If Parent requires the termination of the Company 401(k) Plans, then Parent or
one of Parent's ERISA affiliates shall maintain or cause to be maintained, for

Plans, a defined contribution plan that (i) meets the requirements of Section

to accept, on or after Closing, the rollover by each Continuing Employee of
any "eligible rollover distribution" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4)
of the Code) from the Company 401(k) Plans, including plan loans, in
accordance with applicable Code provisions. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such plan(s) have been
terminated by providing resolutions approving such termination. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the review and approval of
Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Parties shall cooperate with each other and provide each other
with such information as is reasonably necessary to effect the provisions of
this Section 6.8.

Section 6.9 Section 280G. Within thirty (30) days following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall provide to Parent calculations indicating whether
any amounts that could be received (whether in cash, property or the vesting
of property, and whether alone or in connection with any subsequent event) as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Payments")
by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury

payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

Section 6.10 Rule 16b-3. The Company Board of Directors, or a committee of
non-employee directors thereof, shall, prior to the Effective Time, take such
steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause the dispositions by
the Company Insiders of Company Shares (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Shares) contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act in accordance with
Rule 16b-3 and interpretations of the SEC thereunder.

Section 6.11 Delisting. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the other
Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to

be effective until after the Effective Time.

Section 6.12 Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity (at Parent's sole cost and expense) to participate in the
Company's defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the
Company and/or its directors or executive officers



relating to this Agreement and/or the Transactions. The Company agrees that it
shall not settle any litigation commenced after the date of this Agreement
against the Company or its directors, executive officers or similar persons by
any Company Shareholder relating to this Agreement and/or the Transactions
without the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.13 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting any Party's
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Party's
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

that, until December 31, 2022, (a) the manufacturing facilities of the Company
currently located in the State of Israel shall continue to be located in the
State of Israel with, subject to any adjustments necessary, substantially
similar scope of operations as immediately prior to the Effective Time and as
contemplated by the Company's capacity expansion plan and (b) the aggregate
number of employees or contractors employed or engaged by the Surviving
Company and the Company Subsidiaries at such manufacturing facility shall, at
all times, remain sufficient for the operations conducted at such
manufacturing facility.

Section 6.15 Tax Rulings.

(a) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall

Section 2.3(b), Section 2.3(c), Section 2.3(d), Section 2.3(e) and conversion
of the Section 102 Shares in accordance Section 2.1(a) shall not be regarded
as a violation of the "requisite holding period" (as such term is defined in

payment in respect of Cashed-Out Company RSUs and the Per Share Merger
Consideration are deposited with the 102 Trustee until the end of the
respective holding period and (ii) the deposit of the respective Option
Consideration, payment in respect of Cashed-Out Company RSUs and the Per Share

and 2.3(e) shall not constitute a taxable event and that tax continuity shall
apply with respect to the Assumed RSUs and Assumed PSUs (which ruling may be
subject to customary conditions regularly associated with such a ruling) (the
"Options Tax Ruling"). The Company shall include in the request for the
Options Tax Ruling a request to exempt Parent, the Surviving Company, the
Exchange Agent and their respective agents from any withholding obligation. If
the Options Tax Ruling is not



granted prior to the Closing or in accordance with the instructions of the
ITA, the Company shall seek to obtain prior to the Closing an interim tax
ruling confirming, among other things, that Parent and any Person acting on
its behalf (including the Exchange Agent) shall be exempt from Israeli
withholding Tax in relation to any payments made with respect to any Company
Options, Section 102 Shares, Company RSUs or Company PSUs (whether or not
subject to Section 102 of the Ordinance) to the, Exchange Agent, the 102
Trustee or the Company in connection with the Merger (the "Interim Options Tax
Ruling"). To the extent that prior to the Closing an Interim Options Tax
Ruling shall have been obtained, then all references in this Agreement to the

Ruling, until such time that a final definitive Options Tax Ruling is
obtained.

event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company

text of the Interim Option Tax Ruling, the Option Tax Ruling and the
Withholding Tax Ruling shall be subject to the prior written confirmation of
Parent or its counsel, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

and the Withholding Tax Ruling without prior coordination with Parent or its
Representatives, and will enable Parent's Representatives to participate in
all discussions and meetings relating thereto. To the extent that the Parent's
representatives elect not to participate in any meeting or discussion, upon

contained in this Agreement, such that any condition contained in Section 7.1

Parent written notice of such breach and (iii) either such breach is not
capable of cure in a manner sufficient to allow satisfaction of the conditions
contained in Section 7.1



or Section 7.3 prior to the Outside Date or at least forty-five (45) days have
elapsed since the date of delivery of such written notice to Parent and such
breach has not been cured in all material respects; provided, however, that
the Company will not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(d) if there has been any material breach by the Company of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, and such
breach has not been cured in all material respects;

(e) by either Parent or the Company, if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred by 11:59 p.m., local time in Israel, on December 10, 2019 (as it may
be extended pursuant to this Section 8.1(e), the "Outside Date"); provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(e) will not be available to any Party whose breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement has caused, or
resulted in, the Effective Time not occurring prior to the Outside Date; and
provided, further, that (i) if on the Outside Date all of the conditions to
Closing, other than the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) or Section
7.1(c), shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions shall be
capable of being satisfied at such time), the Outside Date will automatically
be extended one (1) time for an additional three (3) months, and (ii) if on
the Outside Date as so extended pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 8.1(e),
all of the conditions to Closing, other than the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c), shall have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
which conditions shall be capable of being satisfied at such time), the
Outside Date will automatically be extended one (1) additional time by an
additional three (3) months;

(f) by Parent, if, prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, (i)
the Company materially and willfully breaches its obligations under Section
5.2, or (ii) the Company Board of Directors shall have effected a Company
Change of Recommendation;

(g) by either the Company or Parent, if the Company Shareholder Approval is
not obtained at the Company Special Meeting or at any adjournment or

or

(h) by the Company in order to accept a Superior Proposal in accordance with
Section 5.2(f); provided that as a condition to the termination of this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.1(h), the Company pays
Parent, or causes Parent to be paid, the Company Termination Fee payable under
Section 8.2(b)(i).

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) To terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1 (other than in the
case of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(a)), the terminating Party shall
give written notice to the other Party specifying the subsection of Section
8.1 pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement will become
null and void and there will be no liability on the part



of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, except that the Confidentiality
Agreement, Section 6.3, this Section 8.2 and Section 9.3 through Section 9.13
will survive such termination; provided, however, that each Party will retain
liability for its fraud or a willful and material breach of its
representations, warranties covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination and any aggrieved Party will be entitled
to all rights and remedies available under applicable Law or in equity.

(b) Company Termination Fee.

(i) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrently with, and as a condition to such termination, an amount in cash
equal to $225,000,000 (the "Company Termination Fee").

(ii) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), (provided
that if either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(g) at a time when Parent would have been entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f) for purposes of this Section
8.2), then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee or cause the
Company Termination Fee to be paid to Parent within five (5) Business Days
after such termination.

(iii) If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) (in each case, solely in the event that the Company Shareholder
Approval has not been obtained and provided that the Company is not entitled
to the Parent Termination Fee (as defined below)), or Section 8.1(g), (B) a
bona fide Competing Proposal made by a Third Party that has been publicly
disclosed after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date of such
termination and has not been publicly withdrawn prior to the Outside Date (in
the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(e)) or the date of the
Company Special Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
8.1(g)), and (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company
either consummates a Competing Proposal or enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to any Competing Proposal and such Competing Proposal (or any
"superior proposal" permitted by the terms of such Competing Proposal) is
subsequently consummated, whether or not within such twelve (12) month period,
then within two (2) Business Days after the date of such consummation, the
Company will pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee.
For purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(iii), the term "Competing Proposal" will
have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 9.5, except that the
references to "20%" and to "80%" will be deemed to be references to "50%".



(iv) In the event any amount is payable by the Company pursuant to the
preceding clauses (i)-(iii), such amount shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. In no event
shall the Company be obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than
one (1) occasion.

(v) The Company acknowledges that (A) the agreements contained in this Section
8.2 are an integral part of the Transactions and that without this Section 8.2
Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement and (B) the
Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions. If the Company fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2(b), the Company shall pay to Parent
all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including reasonable
attorney's fees as well as reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
action initiated by Parent), together with interest on the amount of the
Company Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal, in effect on the date such payment is required to be made.
Subject to Parent's and Merger Sub's rights set forth in Section 9.13(b),
Parent's right to receive payment from the Company of the Company Termination
Fee (under the circumstances in which it is payable) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members or affiliates
(collectively, "Company Related Parties") for any loss suffered as a result of
the failure of the Transactions, including the Merger, to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of
such amount (if entitled under this Section 8.2(b)), none of the Company
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, including the Merger
(except that the Company shall remain obligated for, and Parent and its
affiliates may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the sections of this
Agreement surviving such termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a)). For the
avoidance of doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of
specific performance of the Company's obligation to consummate the Merger in
accordance with Section 9.13(b) and the payment of the Company Termination Fee
under this Section 8.2(b), under no circumstances shall Parent and Merger Sub
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of such specific performance
requiring the Company to consummate the Merger and to pay the Company
Termination Fee (if entitled under this Section 8.2(b)). In any circumstance
where performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement would
relieve the Company of its obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee,
Parent and Merger Sub may, in their sole discretion (i) seek specific
performance pursuant to Section 9.13(b), (ii) withdraw



any claim for specific performance and require payment of the Company
Termination Fee if entitled to payment of the Company Termination Fee under
this Section 8.2(b) or (iii) if Parent and Merger Sub are unable for any
reason to obtain specific performance, require payment of the Company
Termination Fee if entitled to payment of the Company Termination Fee under
this Section 8.2(b). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

(vi) In the event that the Company reasonably determines it is required to
withhold amounts on account of Israeli Taxes from or in connection with the
Company Termination Fee, the Company shall notify Parent of such
determination, if requested by Parent in writing, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after making such determination and provide it with reasonable
time (but in any event no less than twenty (20) days) to obtain a Valid Tax
Certificate allowing the Company to make the payment of the Company
Termination Fee with no withholding, or a reduced rate of withholding, on
account of Israeli Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to Parent. In the event that Parent requests such time extension as
set forth above, then all references in this Agreement to payment of the
Company Termination Fee shall be deemed to provide for a deferral of the time
upon which payment of the Company Termination Fee is due without such deferral
limiting any rights of the Company to terminate this Agreement or in
connection with such termination.

(c) Parent Termination Fee.

(i) If (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing) other than the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b)
with respect to a Specified Antitrust Law or the condition set forth in
Section 7.1(c), and (B) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(e), then Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Company (x) if such termination was by Parent, prior
to or substantially concurrently with, and as a condition to, such
termination, or (y) if such termination was by the Company, within five (5)
Business Days of such termination, an amount in cash equal to $350,000,000
(the "Parent Termination Fee").

(ii) In the event any amount is payable pursuant to the preceding clause (i)
such amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by the Company. In no event shall Parent be
obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.



(iii) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge that (A) the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the Transactions and that without
this Section 8.2 the Company would not have entered into this Agreement and
(B) the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the
circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions. If Parent fails to promptly pay any amount
due pursuant to this Section 8.2(c), Parent shall pay to the Company all
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including reasonable
attorneys' fees as well as reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
action initiated by the Company), together with interest on the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal, in effect on the date such payment is required to be made.
Subject to the Company's rights set forth in Section 9.13(b), the Company's
right to receive payment from Parent of the Parent Termination Fee (under the
circumstances in which it is payable) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company Related Parties against Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any
of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, managers, members or affiliates (collectively, "Parent Related
Parties") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions, including the Merger, to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount (if
entitled under this Section 8.2(c)), none of the Parent Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions, including the Merger (except that Parent and
Merger Sub shall remain obligated for, and the Company and its affiliates may
be entitled to remedies with respect to, the sections of this Agreement
surviving such termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a)). For the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance of
the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger in accordance
with Section 9.13(b) and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under this
Section 8.2(c), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of such specific performance requiring Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and to pay the Parent Termination Fee
(if entitled under this Section 8.2(c)). In any circumstance where performance
by Parent of its obligations under this Agreement would relieve Parent of its
obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee, the Company may, in its sole
discretion (i) seek specific performance pursuant to Section 9.13(b), (ii)
withdraw any claim for specific performance and require payment of the Parent
Termination Fee if entitled to payment of the Parent Termination Fee under
this Section 8.2(c) or (iii) if the Company is unable for any reason to obtain
specific performance, require payment of the Parent Termination Fee if
entitled to payment of the Parent



Termination Fee under this Section 8.2(c). For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

and Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and

this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not
affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any term or provision hereof. The Parties agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application



of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that

provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 9.11 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Israel, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles (whether of the State of Israel or otherwise) that would result in
the application of the Law of any other state.

(b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of
competent jurisdiction located in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Israel in any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or the Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such
Action except in any court of competent jurisdiction located in Tel Aviv-
Jaffa, Israel, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Action may be
heard and determined in any court of competent jurisdiction located in Tel
Aviv-Jaffa, Israel, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such Action in such courts and (iv) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such Action in such courts. Each of the Parties hereto (A)
agrees that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions (including the United States) by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law and (B) waives any objection
to the recognition and enforcement by a court in other jurisdictions
(including the United States) of any such final judgment. Each Party to this
Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this Section 9.11(b) in
the manner provided for notices in Section 9.4 and Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub agree that service provided



to Yigal Arnon and Co. in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.4 that is
substantially concurrently provided to Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, shall constitute valid service on Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub,
as applicable, in Israel. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

Section 9.12 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties; provided that Parent shall be permitted to
assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder to any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Guarantor, and Merger Sub shall be permitted to assign any of
its rights or obligations hereunder to any wholly owned Subsidiary of
Guarantor that is an Israeli entity, but no such assignment shall relieve
Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder and
provided, further, that (i) under no circumstances shall such assignment in
any way prevent, impair or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions and (ii) to the extent any such assignment results in withholding
taxes that exceed the amount of withholding taxes that would have been
applicable but for such assignment, the Party that made such assignment shall
pay additional amounts as necessary to ensure that the recipient of any
payment under this Agreement receives the same amount that it would otherwise
have received if no such assignment had been made, including with respect to
payments pursuant to Article II and Article VIII. Subject to the preceding
sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 9.13 Enforcement; Remedies; Specific Performance.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. Each Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a decree or order of
specific performance to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

(c) The Parties' rights in this Section 9.13 are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objection to any remedy referred
to in this Section 9.13 (including any objection on the basis that there is an
adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity). In the event any Party seeks any
remedy referred to in this Section 9.13, such Party shall not be required



to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.

Section 9.14 Guaranty.

(a) To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, Guarantor, intending
to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees to the Company the full and punctual payment and performance of
Parent's and Merger Sub's (or their respective successors or assigns)
obligations under this Agreement, including any liabilities arising out of a
breach thereof or non-compliance therewith (collectively, the "Guaranteed
Obligations"), and agrees with the Company that if any obligation guaranteed
by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal as a result of the lack
of legal capacity of Parent or Merger Sub or lack of authority of the party
signing on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, it will, as an independent and
primary obligation, indemnify the Company on demand against any cost, loss or
liability it incurs as a result of Parent and/or Merger Sub not paying any
amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality,
have been payable by it under this Agreement on the date when it would have
been due.

(b) The guaranty set forth in Section 9.14(a) (the "Guaranty") is an absolute,
unconditional and continuing guarantee of the payment and performance by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Guaranteed Obligations and will extend to the
ultimate balance of sums payable by Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement. Should Parent or Merger Sub default in the payment or performance
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall
become immediately due and payable and the Guarantor shall discharge them
promptly on demand. Claims hereunder may be made on one or more occasions. If
any payment in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, including in insolvency,
liquidation or administration, then Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder
with respect to such Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been
made.

(c) Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by: (i) any change in
the time, place or manner of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or
rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any agreement evidencing,
securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (ii) the addition, substitution or release of any Person
interested in the Transactions; (iii) any change in the corporate existence,
structure or ownership of Parent or Merger Sub or any assignment of any rights
or obligations of Parent or Merger Sub; (iv) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Parent or Merger Sub or
their assets; (v) the adequacy of any means the Company may have of obtaining
payment related to the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) the taking, variation,
compromise, exchange, renewal or release



of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against,
or security over assets of, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person or any non-
presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in
respect of any instrument or any failure to realize the full value of any
security; or (vii) without prejudice to any defense that would be available to
Guarantor if it had been the principal under this Agreement, or to any defense
available to Parent or Merger Sub, any unenforceability, illegality or
invalidity of any obligation of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person under
this Agreement or any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in
connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor absolutely,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives: (1) promptness, diligence, notice of
the acceptance of the Guaranty and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment,
demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest,
notice of the Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other notices of any
kind, all defenses that may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay,
moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to
require the marshalling of assets of Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person
interested in the Transactions, and all suretyship defenses generally,
defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to
Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement and defenses available to Guarantor
under the Guaranty; (2) any right it may have of first requiring the Company
to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment
from Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person before claiming from Guarantor
under this Section 9.14; (3) all rights and defenses under sections 4(b), 5,
6, 7(b), 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17 of the Guarantee Law, 1967 (the
"Guaranty Law") and confirms that the provisions of the Guarantee Law
affording such rights or defenses to a guarantor shall not apply to the
guarantee granted under this Agreement; and (4) any right of set-off or
counter-claims against the Company. Guarantor acknowledges that these waivers
apply irrespective of any Law to the contrary and that it has received and
will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the Transactions
and that the waivers set forth in this Section 9.14 are knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.

(d) This Guaranty may only be amended by a writing signed and delivered by
Guarantor and the Company. Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it shall
not institute, and shall cause its respective affiliates not to institute, any
Action asserting that the Guaranty is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in
accordance with its terms.

(e) Guarantor represents and warrants to the Company that it is not a "single
guarantor" or a "protected guarantor" within the meaning of such terms under
the Guarantee Law and therefore the rights and protections under Chapter B of
the Guarantee Law do not apply to it.

(f) Guarantor represents and warrants to the Company as set forth in Section
4.3 (Authority Relative to this Agreement), Section 4.4 (No Conflict; Required
Filings and Consents), Section 4.5 (Absence of Litigation), Section 4.7
(Ownership of Company Share Capital), Section 4.8 (Sufficient Funds) and
Section 4.9 (Brokers and Expenses), in each case, mutatis mutandis,



as applicable to Guarantor if any references to Parent are replaced with
references to Guarantor.

(g) For purposes of Section 6.2, all references to Parent or to a party shall
include Guarantor and all references to Subsidiaries of Parent shall include
references to Subsidiaries of Guarantor.

(h) Nothing in this Section 9.14 shall waive any defenses, counterclaims or
rights of setoff that Parent or Merger Sub may have under this Agreement or
applicable Law.
