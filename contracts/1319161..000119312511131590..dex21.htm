consideration,  the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to
this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, (a) Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, (b) the separate corporate

corporate existence under the DGCL as the surviving corporation in the Merger
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and (c) the Surviving Corporation shall
become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to closing contained in Article VI, the closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") shall take place (a) at the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton and Garrison LLP, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, at
10:00 a.m. (local time) on the second Business Day after the day on which the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) are satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , that if the Marketing Period has
not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), the Closing shall
occur on the earlier of (i) a date during the Marketing Period specified by
Parent on not less than two Business Days notice to the Company and (ii) the
second Business Day immediately following the final day of the Marketing
Period (subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or waiver of all of
the conditions set forth in Article VI as of the date determined pursuant to
this proviso), or (b) at such other place and time as Parent and the Company
may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as
the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, Parent and the Company shall
cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
executed, signed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in such form as is required by the relevant provisions of
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger
has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such other subsequent date or time as Parent and the Company may agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the "

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than three Business Days before the Effective
Time, Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company, satisfactory to the
Company in its reasonable discretion, to act as the paying agent in the Merger

sufficient funds for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and
other amounts payable under Article II. Such funds provided to the Paying

customary form, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to such holders shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal

 



4  and (B) instructions for surrendering such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Such instructions shall provide
that: (1) at the election of the surrendering holder, Certificates may be
surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise and (2) the Merger Consideration
payable in exchange for Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares will be payable

(ii) _Surrender of Shares_. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of a Book-Entry
Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the

entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange therefor, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares formerly
evidenced by that Certificate or such Book-Entry Share less any required
withholding of Taxes. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall be canceled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any
amount payable upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, then the Merger Consideration may be paid to such a transferee so
long as (A) the surrendered Certificate is accompanied by all documents
required by Parent to evidence and effect that transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment (x) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or other Taxes
required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate or (y) establishes to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that any such Taxes
have already been paid or are not applicable.

(iv) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
2.2(c), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, subject to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or other distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized by the
Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. Any Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and, in the case of a
Certificate, the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by it. 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the execution and delivery

Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration to such
Person in respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.

 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of

 



5  transfers of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time.

(f) _Required Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the
appropriate taxing authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made
for all purposes under this Agreement.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investment shall be in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United
States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds investing in such
assets. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and at the risk, of
Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such investment shall
be for the benefit of Parent; _provided_ , that no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall promptly
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide,
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount of any such
losses to the extent necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Article II.

 

(i) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent
upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
has not complied with this Article II shall look only to Parent, which shall
remain responsible for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration.

Section 2.3 _Company Options and Company Stock Awards_.

(a) Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof by Parent and
the applicable holder thereof, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
so that, as of the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Common
Stock under the Company Option Plans (each, a " _Company Option_ ")
outstanding immediately before 

 



6  the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of that Company Option, shall be canceled and converted into the right
to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Option Consideration (as defined below) multiplied by
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be acquired upon
exercise of such Company Option, immediately before the Effective Time. "
_Option Consideration_ " means the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the per share exercise or purchase price of the applicable Company
Option.

(b) Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof by Parent and
the applicable holder thereof, each restricted share of Common Stock granted
under the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Award_ ") outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company Stock
Award, shall be, at the Effective Time, either (i) vested to the extent not
already vested or (ii) forfeited and not entitled to any payment hereunder, in
each case, in accordance with its terms. The Company Board or the
Compensation Committee shall accelerate the service-based vesting conditions
applicable to Company Stock Awards effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, but shall not accelerate or otherwise modify in any
respect any performance-based vesting conditions or provisions of any Company
Stock Awards. At the Effective Time, each vested Company Stock Award shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Merger
Consideration.

(c) The payment of the amounts set forth in Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.3(b)
in respect of the Company Options and Company Stock Awards shall be reduced by
any Tax withholding required under the Code or any applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld and paid to
the appropriate taxing authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having
been paid to the holder of that Company Option or Company Stock Award for all
purposes under this Agreement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts
so that all Company Options and Company Stock Awards shall be canceled and all
Company Option Plans and Company Stock Plans shall terminate at the Effective
Time.

 

(d) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to
each holder of Company Options and Company Stock Awards a letter describing
the treatment of and payment for such Company Options or Company Stock Awards
pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing instructions for use in obtaining
payment for such Company Options or Company Stock Awards (which instructions
shall provide that the cash payable to such holder pursuant to this Section
2.3 may be, at the election of such holder, mailed to such holder or
transferred to such holder by wire transfer). Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and after the Effective Time
maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy their obligations to holders of
Company Options and Company Stock Awards pursuant to this Section 2.3.

 



7 (e) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the third Business Day thereafter, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail a check (or transfer by wire
transfer) (i) to each applicable holder of a Company Option, in such amount
due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(a) in respect of such
Company Option and (ii) to each applicable holder of a Company Stock Award, in
such amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(b) in
respect of such Company Stock Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu
of the payments contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation may direct the Paying Agent to pay the Surviving
Corporation (or its designees) for (but only to the extent of) any amounts
the Surviving Corporation elects to pay to each holder of a Company Option or
Company Stock Award in respect of the consideration payable therefor plus any
amounts deducted and withheld with respect to any such amounts. 

(f) In addition to the payment of the amounts set forth in Section 2.3(a),
Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.3(c), the Surviving Corporation and/or Parent
shall pay at the Closing, by check or direct deposit, all accrued dividends
and other distributions (including dividend equivalents) in respect of all
Company Options and Company Stock Awards with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which have been authorized by the Company and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time as set forth on Section 2.3(f) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions and
take such other actions as may reasonably be required to effect the actions
contemplated by this Section 2.3.

(h) The Company shall take or cause to be taken any and all action reasonably
necessary, including by amending the Company Option Plans and Company Stock
Plans, if necessary, to permit the exchange of Company Stock Options or
Company Stock Awards for Parent equity awards pursuant to the agreements
between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company Stock Option or Company
Stock Award referred to in Section 2.3, in each case to the extent consistent
with the Company Option Plans and Company Stock Plans, individual award
agreements and applicable Law. 

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.4), any shares of Common
Stock for which the holder thereof (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented to it in writing and (ii) has demanded the appraisal of such
shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects with, the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(c).
At the Effective Time, (A) all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and cease
to exist and (B) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to
such rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL.

 



8 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holders shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the
Certificate formerly representing such shares or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, in each case in accordance with Section 2.2.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal of any shares of Common Stock, the withdrawals of such demands
and any other instrument served on the Company under the DGCL and (ii) the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands for appraisal. Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the
Company shall not offer to make or make any payment with respect to any such
demands for appraisal, or offer to settle or settle any such demands, in each
case, without the prior written consent of Parent.

also delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of any fee
letter in connection with the Financing Commitments (it being understood that
any such fee letter provided to the Company may be redacted to omit the
numerical amounts and certain other information provided therein) (any such
fee letter, a " _Fee Letter_ "). As of the date hereof, each of the Financing
Commitments is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent or Merger Sub
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to the

Commitments is in full force and effect, and neither of the Financing
Commitments has been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended
or modified in any respect, and no such amendment or modification is
contemplated. As of the date hereof, subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or conditions
set forth in either of the Financing Commitments, and no event has occurred
which, with or without

 



33  notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach, default or failure to satisfy any condition precedent applicable to
Parent or Merger Sub set forth therein. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has no Knowledge that any of the conditions to the Financing will not
be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger
Sub on the date of the Closing; _provided_ , that Parent is not making any
representation regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in Article III, or compliance by the Company of its obligations
under this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Sponsor
nor any Lender has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to
terminate either of the Financing Commitments or not to provide the Financing.
Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance with the terms of the
Financing Commitments, (ii) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Article III and (iii) the performance
by the Company of its obligations under Section 5.1, the net proceeds to be
provided by the Financing will, in the aggregate and together with cash of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the amount of which, for purposes of this
clause (iii), shall be limited to cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries on
the Closing Date before giving effect to the consummation of the Merger less
$97,000,000 and in any event not to exceed $195,000,000), be sufficient to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the payment by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger Consideration, any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation at Closing, and any related repayment or
refinancing of any indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
any other amounts required to be paid at Closing in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent or
Merger Sub has paid in full any and all commitment or other fees required by
the Financing Commitments that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay,
after the date hereof and until the Closing Date, all such commitments and
fees as they become due. There are no side letters, understandings or other
agreements or arrangements relating to the Financing to which Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates are a party other than (x) as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments and delivered to the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement and (y) the Fee Letters. There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing or the conditions precedent thereto under any
agreement relating to the Financing to which Parent or any of its Affiliates
is a party, other than as set forth in the Financing Commitments and any
related Fee Letter that do not impact the conditionality of the Financing (the
" _Disclosed Conditions_ "). No Person has any right to impose, and none of
the Sponsor, any Lender, Parent or Merger Sub has any obligation to accept,
any condition precedent to such funding other than the Disclosed Conditions
nor any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Financing
Commitments on the Closing Date (nor any term or condition which would have
the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under the Financing
Commitments on the Closing Date). As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub believes that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, or
that the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing
under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger, for Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or any alternative financing.

 



34 (b) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of
their Affiliates has (i) retained any financial advisor on a basis exclusive
to Parent and/or Merger Sub and/or any such Affiliate or (ii) entered into an
exclusivity, lock-up or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding
with any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or
Equity Financing that would prevent or hinder such provider from providing or
seeking to provide such financing to any third party in connection with a
transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (including in
connection with the making of any Takeover Proposal), in the case of clauses
(i) and (ii), in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their

with respect to a Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement), (iv) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill

their Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate all discussions and
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore that may be ongoing with

Person to the effect that the Company is ending all discussions
and negotiations with such Person with respect to any Takeover Proposal,
effective immediately, and the notice shall also request such Person to
promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and the Company shall take all reasonable necessary
actions to secure its rights and ensure the performance of any such Persons
obligations under any applicable confidentiality agreement (including

Agreement and prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if
the Company receives a bona fide, written Takeover Proposal and, prior to
taking any action described in clauses (x) and (y) below, the Company Board
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that
(A) based on the information then available and after consultation with its
financial advisor, such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take the
actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect to such Takeover
Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under
applicable Law, then the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal,
(x) furnish access and non-public information with respect to the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal
pursuant to (and may enter into) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so

previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate
in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal.

Board shall not (i) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify, modify or amend (or

fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii)
authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose
to authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable (except to the
extent required by applicable Law in respect of a notice delivered by the
Company pursuant to Section 5.4(e)), a Takeover Proposal (any of the foregoing
actions in clause (i) or (ii), a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), or (iii)
approve, recommend or allow the Company to enter into a Contract relating to a
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

 

(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d), at any time before obtaining the Requisite
Company Vote, the Company Board may (x) effect a Change of Recommendation if
an event, fact, development or occurrence that affects the business, assets,
operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company that is
unknown to the Company Board as of immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement becomes known to the Company Board (an " _Intervening Event_ ") or
in response to a Superior Proposal or (y) in response to a Superior Proposal
received by the Company Board after the date of this Agreement, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a) (concurrently with the payment of
the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.6(b)), and
concurrently enter into a Contract with respect to such Superior Proposal, but
only if, in the case of either of clause (x) or (y):

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with an
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under
applicable Law and the Company shall have complied in all material respects
with all of its obligations under this Section 5.4 ( _provided_ , that, an
otherwise immaterial breach shall be deemed material if it materially
contributed to the receipt of a Takeover Proposal);

 

(ii) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent, at
least three Business Days in advance, that it will effect a Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a), as the
case may be, which notice shall include the material terms and conditions of
the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and the identity
of the party making such Superior Proposal and include copies of the final
forms of all relevant documents relating to such

 



44  Superior Proposal or a description in reasonable detail of such Intervening
Event, as the case may be;

(iii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a), the
Company shall have negotiated with Parent (if so requested by Parent) in good
faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Parent (if any) as would permit the Company, to the extent
consistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties, not to effect a Change
of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(a); and

(iv) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement offered by Parent and shall have determined (x) in the event
the Company Boards determination pursuant to clause (i) above is in response
to a Superior Proposal, that such Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect;
_provided_ , that in the event of any material revisions to the Takeover
Proposal that the Company Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
again comply with the requirements of this Section 5.4(e) with respect to such
new written notice (including the three Business Day notice period referenced
above), or (y) in the event the Company Boards determination pursuant to
clause (i) above is in response to an Intervening Event, that such changes
would not obviate the need for a Change of Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that (i) any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and
listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a Change of
Recommendation for all purposes under this Agreement if it is inconsistent
with the Company Board Recommendation unless the Company expressly reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation within three (3) Business Days following any
request by Parent and (ii) any such disclosure that is Change of
Recommendation may only be made upon compliance with the requirements of

Merger Sub in connection with the preparation of the Company Proxy
Statement for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein and (ii) the
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant and agree that none of the
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any Affiliate
of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Company Proxy Statement shall, at the date it is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting
or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
that no representation or warranty is made by either Parent or Merger Sub (and
the foregoing shall not apply) with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference therein to the extent based on information supplied by the
Company or any Affiliate of the Company in connection with the preparation of
the Company Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein.

 



46 (d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond to any
comments on the Company Proxy Statement or requests for additional
information from the SEC as soon as practicable after receipt of any such
comments or requests and (ii) cause the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable following the
clearance of the Company Proxy Statement by the SEC. The Company shall
promptly (A) notify Parent upon the receipt of any such comments or requests
and (B) provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company
and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the
other hand, to the extent such correspondence relates to the Company Proxy
Statement. Before responding to any such comments or requests or the filing
or mailing of the Company Proxy Statement, the Company (x) shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of
the Company Proxy Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto)
and related correspondence and filings and (y) shall include in such drafts,
correspondence and filings all comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

(e) The Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation
unless the Company Board has effected a Change of Recommendation in compliance
with Sections 5.4(d) and (e).

 

Section 5.6 _Company Stockholders Meeting_.

(a) Subject to Section 5.4 and this Section 5.6(a), the Company shall call and
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting within 30 days following the date of
mailing the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Company Vote. Subject to Section 5.4, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from its stockholders proxies
in favor of adoption of this Agreement; provided, that the Company may
postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to a later date:
(a) with the consent of Parent, (b) for the absence of a quorum, (c) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary or
advisable under applicable Laws and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the Companys stockholders
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting or (d) if the Company has provided a
written notice to Parent pursuant to Section 5.4(e)(i) and the latest deadline
contemplated by Section 5.4(e) with respect to such notice has not been
reached.

(b) The Company shall establish a record date for purposes of determining the
stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting (the " _Record Date_ "). Once the Company has established the Record
Date, the Company may not change such Record Date or establish a different
Record Date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written
consent of Parent if such change or different Record Date will result in a
delay of the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, except as required
by applicable Law or to the extent in compliance with the provisions of
Section 5.6(a). In the event that the date of the Company Stockholders

 



47  Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or
otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that it shall implement such adjournment
or postponement or other delay in accordance with applicable Law or the
Companys bylaws.

Section 5.7 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) For a period of six months following the Closing (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates to, provide to individuals who, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, were Employees with salaries or wages, short term bonus
or commission opportunities, and other compensation and benefits, that, taken
as a whole for each such individual, are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the salaries or wage rates, compensation opportunities and
benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
individual immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding compensation
under any equity-based plan, program or arrangement; _provided_ , that nothing
contained herein shall limit Parents, the Surviving Corporations or any of
their respective Affiliates ability to modify wages, salaries, compensation
or benefits because of or in response to performance issues with particular
employees, groups of employees or business units. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth herein, after the Effective Time, nothing herein shall
preclude the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any
Employee.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of their
respective Affiliates to, honor all Company Benefit Plans (including all
severance, change of control and similar plans and agreements) in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject
to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such Company
Benefit Plans; provided, that nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or
termination of any specific plan, program policy, agreement or arrangement, or
interfere with Parents, the Surviving Corporations or any of their
respective Affiliates rights or obligations to make such changes as
are necessary to comply with applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
Section 5.7(a), Parent shall provide each Employee who suffers a termination
of employment during the Continuation Period under circumstances that would
have given the Employee a right to severance payments and benefits under the
Companys severance policy or individual employment, severance or separation
agreement or other arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " _Company Severance Plan_ ") with severance payments and
benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such
Employee under the applicable Company Severance Plan, as calculated using the
same salary or hourly wage rate or other compensation, as applicable,
provided to such Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and such Employee may
otherwise agree in writing. Following the end of the Continuation Period,
Parent shall be permitted to alter the duties and employment terms applicable
to a given Employee unless prohibited under the terms of any employment
agreement with such Employee.

 



48 (c) For all purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits under all
employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Affiliates providing benefits to any Employee after the Effective
Time (the " _New Plans_ "), but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical plan (other than as required
by applicable Law), each Employee shall receive full credit for such
Employees years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the
Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other
entities for which the Company and its Subsidiaries have given credit for
prior service), to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, prior to the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar or comparable
Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, where applicable, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) at the Effective Time,
each Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in each New Plan to the extent such waiting time was satisfied
under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), (ii) Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan
to be waived or satisfied for such Employee and his or her covered dependents
to the extent waived or satisfied under the analogous Old Plan as of the
Effective Time and (iii) Parent shall cause all eligible expenses incurred by
each Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Employees participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 

(d) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which any Employee
is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy or individual agreement or other
arrangement applicable to such Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (the " _Vacation Policy_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to, (i) allow such Employee
to use such accrued vacation and (ii) if any Employees employment terminates
during the Continuation Period under circumstances entitling the Employee to
severance pay under the Company Severance Plan, pay the Employee, in cash, an
amount equal to the value of the accrued vacation time to the same extent that
the Employee would have received a cash payment therefor under the Vacation
Policy or the applicable Company Severance Plan as in effect on the date of
this Agreement.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any employment agreement to
which an Employee is party, which exists as of the Effective Time, expressly
requires the successor of the Company, its business or its assets to expressly
assume and agree to perform such agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession
had taken place (or such words of like import), the Surviving Corporation
expressly so assumes and agrees.

 



49 (f) Nothing in this Section 5.7, whether express or implied, shall confer upon
any Person (including any current or former employee of the Company, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates), any third
party beneficiary or other rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period or continued
participation in any Company Benefit Plan, of any nature or kind whatsoever
under or by reason of this Section 5.7. No provision of this Section 5.7 is
intended to and such provisions do not modify, amend or create any employee
benefit plan of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates.

Section 5.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of any present
or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and the fiduciaries of any Company Benefit Plans (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in (i) the Organizational Documents of
the Company, (ii) the minutes of any meetings of the Company Board or any
committee of the Company Board, (iii) the minutes of any meetings of the
boards of directors, or any committee of the boards of directors or equivalent
governing bodies, of any of the Subsidiaries, (iv) agreements between
an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or (v)
otherwise in effect at the Effective Time, to survive the Merger and to
continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years
after the Effective Time or, if longer, for such period as is set forth in
any applicable agreement with an Indemnified Party in effect on the date of
this Agreement, and all rights to advancement and indemnification shall, with
respect to any claim or matter asserted prior to such period, continue for
the duration of any such claim or matter.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with respect to any claim, demand,
suit, action, proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (" _Indemnified Claim_ "),
for acts or omissions arising out of or relating, in whole or in part, to
their services as directors, officers or employees of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or another Person, if such Indemnified Party is or was serving as
a director, officer or employee of such other Person at the request of the
Company, or fiduciaries of the Company Benefit Plans, whether asserted or
claimed at, after or before the Effective Time (including in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise). If any Indemnified
Party is or becomes involved in any Indemnified Claim or other matter subject
to indemnification hereunder, the Surviving Corporation shall advance as
incurred and interest free any costs or expenses (including legal fees and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, amounts paid in
settlement or other Liabilities (" _Damages_ ") arising out of or incurred in
connection with such Indemnified Claim or other matter, subject to the
Surviving Corporations, as applicable, receipt of an unsecured undertaking by
or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if required by the DGCL, to repay
such Damages if it is ultimately determined under

 



50  applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified. In the event of any Indemnified Claim, (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of such
Indemnified Claim and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not settle,
compromise or seek or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Indemnified
Claim pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Party is a
party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Indemnified Claim.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for at least six years
after the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company or policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events
which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) so long as the Surviving
Corporation is not required to pay an annual premium in excess of 300% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance before the date of
this Agreement (such 300% amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior
sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, then the
Surviving Corporation shall instead obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in lieu of the arrangements contemplated by this Section
5.8(c), before the Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to purchase a
"tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the
matters described in this Section 5.8(c) and for the same limits of liability
as the current directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company, which cost of such tail policy shall not exceed the Maximum Premium,
and, if the Company elects to purchase such a policy before the Effective
Time, then the Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section 5.8(c)
shall be satisfied so long as the Surviving Corporation causes such policy to
be maintained in effect for a period of six years following the Effective
Time.

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that the Indemnified Parties may have certain
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided
by other Persons. Parent hereby agrees that (i) the Surviving Corporation is
the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the Indemnified
Parties are primary and any obligation of such other Persons to advance
expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities
incurred by any such Indemnified Party are secondary) and (ii) the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred
by any such Indemnified Party and shall be liable for the full
indemnifiable amounts, without regard to any rights any such Indemnified
Party may have against any such other Person. The Surviving Corporation
further agrees that no advancement or payment by any of such other Persons on
behalf of any such Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for which such
Indemnified Party has sought

 



51  indemnification from the Surviving Corporation shall affect the foregoing
and such other Persons shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated
to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery
of such Indemnified Party against the Surviving Corporation.

(e) The covenants contained in this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The obligations of the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.8 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.8 applies unless (x) such termination
or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnified
Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.8
applies, and any Person who pays advancement or indemnification to or on
behalf of any of the Indemnified Parties as described in the last sentence
of Section 5.8(d), shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8).

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action so that the successors
or assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.8.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.8 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

Section 5.9 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Law,
each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
ensure that the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable. The terms of this Section 5.9 shall not limit the rights of the
Company set forth in Section 5.4.

 

Section 5.10 _Consents; Filings; Further Action; Notices_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall,

 



52  and Parent shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly (i) obtain any consents, approvals or other
authorizations, and make any filings and notifications, required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) make any
other submissions either required or deemed appropriate by either Parent or
the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, any Foreign
Competition Law, the DGCL, the Applicable Exchange rules and regulations and
any other applicable Law and (iii) take or cause to be taken all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this Section 5.10 to
cause the expiration of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required
consents, approvals or authorizations, as applicable, under such Laws as soon
as practicable;  _provided_ , that subject to Section 5.10(d), the Company
and its Affiliates shall not give any undertakings, make any commitments or
enter into any agreements that would be binding upon Parent or any of its
Affiliates, including after the Closing, the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of Parent. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings and notifications, including by providing copies
of all relevant documents to the non-filing party and its advisors before
filing. No party shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory
deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any
Governmental Authority without the consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company shall file, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to file, and, unless so requested by the applicable Governmental
Authority, not withdraw (i) any notification and report forms and related
material required to be filed by it with the Federal Trade Commission and
the United States Department of Justice, as applicable, and (ii) any filings
required to be made by it with any Governmental Authority in the European
Union, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall promptly make any further filings
pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable. Without limiting
the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that they shall use their
reasonable best efforts to, no later than the first Business Day after 21
calendar days following the date hereof, file, and cause their respective
Affiliates to file, the reports set forth on Section 5.10(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent or the Company (or
any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional
information from any Governmental Authority that is related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall
endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, to the extent practicable
and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such
request. No party shall participate in any meeting or engage in any material
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority without giving

 



53  the other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or
participate. Parent shall advise the Company promptly of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which Parent proposes to make or
enter into with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Law
as promptly as practicable.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
take, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to take all actions within its
power to avoid the entry or to effect the dissolution of, or vacate or lift,
any Order which would otherwise have the effect of preventing, impairing or
delaying the Closing, including (i) selling, licensing, divesting or
disposing of or holding separate any entities, assets, Intellectual Property
or businesses (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries), (ii) terminating, amending or assigning existing
relationships or contractual rights and obligations, (iii) changing or
modifying any course of conduct regarding future operations, (iv) otherwise
taking actions that would limit its freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more of their respective businesses, assets or
rights or interests therein and (v) committing to take any such actions in the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv). For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries to, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to, take any action described in
this Section 5.10(d) with respect to any Order or any applicable Law which
would bind the Company or its Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the Merger
occurs.

(e) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any action commenced or, to such partys
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, arising from or relating to
this Agreement or the Merger and other the transactions contemplated hereby ("
_Transaction Litigation_ ") and (iii) if a party becomes aware of any facts or
circumstances that such party believes constitute, or with the passage of
time are reasonably likely to constitute, a breach of this Agreement by the
other party or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition to the obligations of any party hereto to effect the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;
_provided_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger under this Agreement; _provided_
, _further_ , that 

 



54  except as set forth in Section 5.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, (x)
the Company and Parent shall give each other the opportunity to participate in
the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation and (y)
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or Representative of the
Company shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding, or offer
or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any
Transaction Litigation or consent to the same, unless Parent shall have
consented in writing.

 

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Except as provided for in this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except to the extent required by applicable Law or
the Applicable Exchange requirements, in which case that party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing
any such release or making any such public statement; _provided_ , that, so
as the Company is in compliance with the requirements of Section 5.4, Parents
consent shall not be required, and the Company shall not be required to
consult with Parent in connection with, or provide Parent an opportunity to
review or comment upon, any press release or other public statement or comment
to be issued or made with respect to any Takeover Proposal or with respect to
any actions contemplated by Section 5.4(e) or Section 5.4(f). Without the
prior consent of the other parties, the Company may disseminate the
information included in a press release or other document previously approved
for external distribution by Parent. 

Section 5.12 _Fees, Expenses and Conveyance Taxes_. Except as explicitly
provided otherwise in this Agreement, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all expenses (including those payable to Representatives)
incurred by any party to this Agreement or on its behalf in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Expenses_ ") shall be paid by the party incurring those Expenses.

Section 5.13 _Financing_. 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the
Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the Financing
Commitments (including the flex provisions), including using its reasonable
best efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the
Financing Commitments, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the Financing Commitments on terms and conditions (including
flex provisions) no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those
contained in the Financing Commitments, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis or
obtain the waiver of all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub that
are within their respective control contained in the Financing Commitments (or
any definitive agreements related thereto), including the payment of any
commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the
Financing and (iv) consummate the Financing substantially

 



55  concurrent with the Merger (for the avoidance of doubt, it is not a
condition to Closing under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the
Merger, for Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or any alternative
financing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately
preceding sentence, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each
of its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Financing Commitments and (ii) enforce all of its rights under the
Financing Commitments or any definitive agreements relating thereto. Parent
shall keep the Company informed on a regular basis and in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (including providing the
Company with copies of all definitive agreements and other documents related
to the Financing). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (x) of any material
breach or default by any party to any of the Financing Commitments, the Equity
Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which
Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (y) of the receipt of (A) any written
notice or (B) other written communication, in each case from any Financing
source with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Commitments,
the Equity Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing
of any provisions of the Financing Commitments, the Equity Commitment Letter
or definitive agreements related to the Financing or (2) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to any of the Financing Commitments,
the Equity Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing
with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the
Financing to be funded at Closing, and (z) if at any time for any reason
Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Commitments,
the Equity Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the
Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two
Business Days of the date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a
written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ ,
that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to provide any such
information to the Company if such information is subject to attorney-client
privilege, _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Parent and/or
Merger Sub do not provide the Company with such information in reliance on any
attorney-client privilege, Parent shall provide notice to the Company that it
is withholding such information and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable
information in a way that would not risk waiver of such privilege. Parent
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify,
supplement or waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding
contained in the Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related
thereto) or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Financing
Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto), in each case to
the extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver could reasonably
be expected to have the effect of (A) adversely affecting the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (B) amending, modifying or supplementing the conditions or
contingencies to the Financing in a manner that makes it less likely the

 



56  Financing will be funded or imposing new or additional conditions or
expanding any existing condition to the receipt of the Financing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein,
Parent may replace, amend or modify the Debt Commitment Letters (y) to add or
replace Lenders, lead arrangers, syndication agents, bookrunners or similar
entities and (z) otherwise so long as such changes would not delay or
adversely impact the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. In the event all conditions applicable to the Financing
Commitments have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Lenders and Sponsor to fund the Financing required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement substantially concurrent with
the Merger (including, other than with respect to the providers of the
Equity Financing, to the extent appropriate under the circumstances, through
litigation pursued in good faith). In the event that any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable, Parent shall notify the Company and use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange alternative financing from the same or
other sources of financing on terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) not materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those
contained in the Financing Commitments as of the date hereof, and in an
amount sufficient to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth herein (such alternative
financing, together with the Financing, the " _Available Financing_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, the syndication of any part of the Debt Financing in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters in effect as of the
date of this Agreement (or, if amended or replaced in accordance with the
terms hereof, if such amendment or replacement contains substantially similar
terms with respect to such syndication) shall not be deemed to violate
Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to,
at Parents sole cost and expense, cooperate reasonably with Parent, Merger
Sub and their authorized Representatives and take such actions as Parent or
Merger Sub may reasonably request in connection with the arrangement of the
Available Financing, including (i) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings on reasonable advance notice, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in
connection with the Available Financing, (ii) as promptly as practicable,
furnishing all customary information (other than financial information which
is covered in clause (iii) below) and data regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent for inclusion in
offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents and bank information memoranda and similar documents; _provided_ ,
that any such memoranda or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and
financial statements with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation
as the obligor, (iii) furnishing the Required Information and all financial
statements, pro forma financial statements and business and other
financial data and information of the Company and its Subsidiaries the
receipt of which is an express condition to the obligations of the Lenders
under the Debt Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date of this Agreement);
_provided_ , that the Company shall only be required to furnish pro forma
financial statements or forecasts if Parent or Merger Sub has provided the
Company information relating to the proposed debt and equity capitalization 

 



57  at least fifteen days prior to the date pro forma financial statements are
required to be delivered, (iv) assisting with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, offering memoranda, private placement memoranda,
prospectuses and bank information memoranda and similar documents, (v) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, accountant
consents, customary legal opinions, surveys, intellectual property reports,
appraisals and title insurance reasonably requested by Parent, (vi)
cooperating in respect of the preparation of, and, if applicable, executing
and delivering, any underwriting or placement agreements, indentures, credit
agreements, guarantees, pledge and security documents, currency or interest
hedging agreements and other definitive financing agreements, and customary
closing certificates and documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (including delivery of a solvency certificate, on a pro forma basis,
substantially in the form contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (as in
effect on the date hereof)), (vii) delivering notices of redemption or
prepayment within the time periods required by the relevant agreements
governing indebtedness and obtaining customary payoff letters, lien
terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at the Closing, and
giving any other necessary notices, certificates or other documents or
instruments, to allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in full on the
Closing, of all indebtedness, (viii) facilitating the consummation of the
Available Financing and the direct borrowing or incurrence of all proceeds
of the Available Financing, by the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time and the distribution or payment of the proceeds
of the Debt Financing, if any, obtained by any Subsidiary of the Company to
the Surviving Corporation, (ix) facilitating the distributions of the
proceeds of the Debt Financing, if any, obtained by any Subsidiary of the
Company to the Surviving Corporation and causing WMG Acquisition Corp. to
distribute as a dividend at or immediately following the Effective Time the
amount available for distribution as a restricted payment under Section
4.11(a) of the Indenture, dated as of May 28, 2009 between WMG Acquisition
Corp., as issuer, the guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank National
Association as trustee and (x) furnishing Parent and its Lenders promptly with
all documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act; _provided_ , that with respect to the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to become subject to any
obligations or liabilities with respect to such agreements or documents prior
to the Closing;  _provided_ , _further_ that with respect to the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to
take any action that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry
into any agreement) or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time,
or deliver, or cause to be delivered, any legal opinion by its counsel. The
Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Available Financing;  _provided_ , that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any non-public
information provided to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 5.13(b)
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company and its
Representatives shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on any financing documents and any materials that are to be presented during
any meetings conducted in connection with the Financing, and Parent shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or 

 



58  changes suggested thereto by the Company and its Representatives. Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives shall not have any responsibility for (or, with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing), incur any
liability to any Person under or in connection with, the arrangement of the
Financing or any alternative financing that Parent or Merger Sub may raise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, (x) promptly, upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 5.13 and (y) indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from
and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing or any alternative financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection
therewith). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
dividend required pursuant to this Section 5.13(b) shall not be required to
be declared or paid, or any determination in respect thereof made, at any time
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall take the actions set forth in Section
5.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

Section 5.14 _Section 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
(and shall be permitted to) take such steps as may be reasonably required to
cause dispositions of the Companys equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.15 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute shall become or is
deemed to be applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
herein after the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent and the
members of their respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein
and otherwise act to eliminate if possible, and otherwise to minimize,
the effects of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 5.16 _FIRPTA Certificate_. On or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate or certificates in compliance
with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2, certifying that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are exempt from withholding under Section 1445
of the Code; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parents sole right if the Company fails to provide such
certificate shall be to make an appropriate withholding under Sections 897
and 1445 of the Code.

to Section 5.9, Section 5.10 and Section 5.13.

to this Article VII, it shall become void and of no further force and effect,
with no liability on the part of any party to this Agreement (or any Parent
Related Party or Company Related Party) other than as provided in Section 7.6
and _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the provisions of Section 5.3(b), Section 5.12, the last

made by the Company concurrently with and shall be a condition to such
termination) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(a) (in which case the
payment described below shall be made by the Company within three Business
Days following such termination) or (y) if (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have
been publicly made or publicly proposed to the Company or otherwise publicly
announced or otherwise disclosed, in each case, after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (B) this
Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.2(a)
or to Section 7.2(b) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(b) and (C) within
twelve months following the date of such termination, a transaction in respect

into a Contract in respect of any Takeover Proposal and the transaction is
subsequently consummated (in which case payment shall be made within five
Business Days following the date on which the Company consummates such
Takeover Proposal), then the Company shall pay, or cause to

 



64  be paid, to Parent or its designee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds an amount equal to $56 million (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "). For
purposes of the foregoing clause (C), references in the definition of the
term "Takeover Proposal" to the figure "20%" shall be deemed to be replaced by
"more than 50%".

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) Section
7.4(b)(x) and, at such time, all the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2 were satisfied or waived or reasonably certain to be satisfied
prior to the Termination Date (in each case, other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of
which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing), and the Marketing Period
had ended, (ii) Section 7.2(a) and the Company would have been entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(c) but for (x) the fact that
the Marketing Period has not ended and Parent did not commence the Marketing
Period after the events set forth in clause (i) and clause (ii) of the
definition of "Marketing Period Start Date" were satisfied and prior to the
Marketing Period Start Date, or (y) the fact that Parent availed itself of
the fifteen Business Day extension in Section 7.4(c), or (iii) Section 7.4(c),
then Parent shall pay to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available
funds an amount equal to $60 million (such amount, the " _Parent Termination
Fee_ ") within three Business Days of such termination; _provided_ , that in
the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii)(x) and (iii) (but in the
case of (iii), except if Parent availed itself of the fifteen Business Day
extension in Section 7.4(c)), Parent shall not be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee if (A) at the time of such termination, it was reasonably
apparent that the Financing would not have been obtained and (B) a material
breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements in this Agreement materially contributed to the failure to obtain
such Financing.

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article
VII, and a Willful Breach has occurred that materially contributed to the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date, then Parent shall promptly, but
in no event later than three Business Days after the date of termination of
this Agreement (or such other time during the six-month period following such
termination as the Company shall have discovered the existence of such Willful
Breach), pay the Company an amount equal to $140 million less any previously
paid Parent Termination Fee (such amount, the " _Breach Fee_ "). In the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.4(b)(y), Parent shall
promptly, but in no event later than three Business Days after the date of
such termination of this Agreement, pay the Company the Breach Fee. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to the
payment of more than one Breach Fee.

(e) Parent and the Company acknowledge that (i) the fees and other provisions
of this Section 7.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements, Parent and the Company would
not enter into this Agreement and (iii) any amount payable pursuant to this
Section 7.6 does not constitute a penalty. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, other than as provided in the immediately
succeeding sentence and other than as expressly permitted in the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Limited Performance Guarantee, in

 



65  the event Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing or otherwise
breach this Agreement or fail to perform hereunder, then, except for an order
of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by
Section 8.15, the Companys sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against (w) Parent, Merger Sub or
the Guarantor, (x) the former, current and future holders of any equity,
partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or assignees of
Parent, Merger Sub, Sponsor or the Guarantor, (y) any Lender or Debt
Financing Party or (z) any future holders of any equity, partnership or
limited liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, stockholders, assignees of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ "), in each case other than
Parent and Merger Sub in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in
connection herewith, including the Debt Commitment Letters and the Limited
Guarantee (but excluding the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited
Performance Guarantee), and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Article VII and
collect, if due, any amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.6(c) or Section
7.6(d) from Parent or pursuant to the Limited Guarantee, and upon payment
of any such amounts in accordance with this Section 7.6, other than as
provided in the immediately succeeding sentence and other than as expressly
permitted in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Performance
Guarantee, (1) no Parent Related Party shall have any further liability or
obligation to the Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Limited Guarantee, the Limited Performance Guarantee and the
Financing Commitments or the transactions contemplated by hereby or thereby,
(2) neither the Company nor any Company Related Party shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub
or any other Parent Related Party arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the Limited Guarantee or the Limited
Performance Guarantee, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis
for such termination and (3) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause any Litigation pending in connection with this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including any Litigation related to
the Financing, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letters, the
Limited Guarantee or the Limited Performance Guarantee) by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or its and their Affiliates and any of their respective former,
current or future directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or
assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Company Related
Parties_ ") against Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Related Party to be
dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any event within five Business Days
after payment of any such amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Parent

after payment of any such amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Article VII, and the
Company has committed a material breach of any material representation,
warranty or covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement, which
breach (i) has materially contributed to the failure of the Closing to occur
and (ii) is a consequence of an act or failure to act by the Company with the
actual knowledge of the Person taking or failing to take such action on
behalf of the Company that the taking of such act or failure to take such act
would cause or constitute a breach of this Agreement, then Parent shall be
entitled to pursue a claim against the Company for actual monetary damages
arising as a result of such breach, but excluding any speculative, punitive or
special damages (and in any case, calculated solely on the basis that the
Company will remain a standalone business without consideration of any
possible acquisitions), less any previously paid Company Termination Fee,

67  reasonable best efforts to cause such bank to provide written notice to the
Company promptly upon any request for withdrawal or release of funds from such
account, and in any event two days prior to any withdrawal or release of
funds therefrom. Until the earlier of the termination of the Limited Guarantee

termination of this Agreement, if prior to such date the Company has not made
a claim for payment of Obligations, (i) the Depositor shall maintain such
account free of Liens and (ii) the Depositor shall not withdraw any amount
from such account if following such withdrawal such account would
contain less than $140 million.

and schedules hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure

85  Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or that the disclosure of such be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement.

inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of

(a) Subject to Section 7.6, the parties to this Agreement agree that

not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination of
this agreement pursuant to Article VII and subject to the requirements set
forth in Section 8.15(b), the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy at
law or in equity, and the parties to this Agreement hereby waive any
requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection
therewith.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.15(a), the parties hereby further acknowledge
and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to specific
performance of Parents obligation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
the Sponsors and Parents obligation pursuant to the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Guarantors obligation pursuant to the terms of the
Limited Performance Guarantee, in each case, to cause the Equity Financing
(and the funding pursuant to the Limited Performance Guarantee) to be funded
to fund the Merger and to consummate the Merger subject to the requirement
that (A) all the conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived, (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded
at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (C) Parent
and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 and (D) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then the Closing will occur and that it is willing to waive any
unsatisfied conditions in Section 6.3 (but solely for purposes of consummating
the Merger). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation to
cause Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt
Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).

 



86 (c) Each party hereto agrees that it will not, and will not permit its
Affiliates to, oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the basis that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law
or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.

Section 8.16 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon
a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an
original of this Agreement. Facsimile signatures or signatures received as a

all of the other parties hereto.
