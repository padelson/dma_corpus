amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the

that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for

transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the
Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.02, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in

under the terms of this warrant, the Holder shall have the right to convert this warrant or any
portion thereof (the &#147;<U>Conversion Right</U>&#148;) into shares of Common Stock as provided in this
Section&nbsp;9 at any time or from time to time during the term of this warrant. Upon exercise of the
Conversion Right with respect to a particular number of shares subject to this warrant (the
&#147;<U>Converted Warrant Shares</U>&#148;), the Company shall deliver to the Holder (without payment by
the Holder of any exercise price or any cash or other consideration) that number of shares of fully
paid and nonassessable Common Stock as is determined according to the following formula:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X = (B &#151; A) divided by Y
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where: X = the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be issued to Holder
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Method of Exercise</U>. The Conversion Right may be exercised by the Holder by the
surrender of this warrant at the principal office of the Company together with a written statement
(which may be in the form of Exhibit&nbsp;A-1) specifying that the Holder thereby intends to exercise
the Conversion Right and indicating the number of shares subject to this warrant which are being
surrendered (referred to in Section 9(a) hereof as the Converted Warrant Shares) in exercise of the
Conversion Right. Such conversion shall be effective upon receipt by the Company of this warrant
together with the aforesaid written statement, or on such later date as is specified therein (the
&#147;<U>Conversion Date</U>&#148;). Certificates for the shares issuable upon exercise of the Conversion
Right and, if applicable, a new warrant evidencing the balance of the shares remaining subject to
this warrant, shall be issued as of the Conversion Date and shall be delivered to the Holder within
thirty (30)&nbsp;days following the Conversion Date.

market value</U>&#148; of a share of Common Stock as of a particular date (the &#147;<U>Determination
Date</U>&#148;) shall mean: (i)&nbsp;if traded on a securities exchange, the fair market value of the Common
Stock shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the Common Stock on such exchange
over the five trading days immediately prior to the Determination Date as reported by Bloomberg
Financial Markets (or a comparable reporting service of national reputation selected by the Company
and reasonably acceptable to the Holder if Bloomberg Financial Markets is not then reporting sales
prices of such security) (collectively, &#147;<U>Bloomberg</U>&#148;); (ii)&nbsp;if traded on a market that is
not a securities exchange, the fair market value of the Common Stock shall be deemed to be the
average of the closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the five trading days immediately prior
to the Determination Date as reported by Bloomberg; and (iii)&nbsp;if there is no public market for the
Common Stock, then fair market value shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company
in good faith.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>Automatic Exercise</U>: If this Warrant would terminate or expire but for the
application of this Section&nbsp;9(d), then if the fair market value of one share of Common Stock
exceeds the Warrant Price this Warrant shall be deemed automatically converted pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;9 immediately prior to such termination or expiration.

reviews the Registration Statement and requires the Company to make modifications thereto, then the
Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to 120 calendar days after the Filing Deadline. In the
event that, before the Registration Statement is declared effective, the offices of the Securities and Exchange Commission are closed due to acts of
God, war or terror (or similar circumstances), the Effectiveness Deadline will be extended by a
number of days equal to the days of any such closure.

future circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as from time to time
amended (the &#147;Securities Laws&#148;) with respect to any disposition of the Collateral permitted
hereunder. The Pledgor understands that compliance with the Securities Laws may very strictly
limit the course of conduct of the Lender if the Lender were to attempt to dispose of all or any
portion of the Collateral and may also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any
subsequent transferee of the Collateral or any portion thereof may dispose of the same. There may
be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Lender in any attempt to dispose of all or
any portion of the Collateral under the applicable Blue Sky or other securities laws or similar
laws analogous in purpose or effect. The Lender may be compelled to resort to one or more private
sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to
acquire such Collateral for such purchasers&#146; own account for investment only and not to engage in a
distribution or resale thereof. The Pledgor agrees that the Lender shall not incur

of stock, if a private sale is effected by the Lender in a manner that the Lender reasonably
believes is in all other respects commercially reasonable (within the meaning of the Code). The
Pledgor hereby waives any claims against the Lender arising by reason of the fact that the price at
which the Collateral may have been sold at such sale was less than the price that might have been
obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Obligations, even if the
Lender shall accept the first offer received and does not offer any portion of the Collateral to
more than one possible purchaser. The Pledgor further agrees that the Lender has no obligation to
delay the sale of any Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer of such
Collateral to qualify or register such Collateral for public sale under the Securities Laws,
applicable Blue Sky laws and other applicable state and/or federal securities laws, even if such
issuer would agree to do so, or to delay the sale of any Collateral for any other or no reason.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the provisions of this Section&nbsp;7 would apply if,
for example, the Lender were to place all or any portion of the Collateral for private placement by
an investment banking firm, or if such investment banking firm purchased all or any portion of the
Collateral for its own account, or if the Lender placed all or any portion of the Collateral
privately with a purchaser or purchasers.

option, to file a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement as a financing
statement and shall be sufficient as a financing statement under the Code and to file financing
statements or amendments thereto without the signature of the Pledgor and, if a signature is

whatsoever which may be asserted against it by reason of any alleged obligations or undertakings on

Pledgor of any event requiring indemnification within ten days following the Lender&#146;s receipt of

exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not the
Lender has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any necessary
steps to preserve rights against any parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The
