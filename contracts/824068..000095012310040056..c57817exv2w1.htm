 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously adopted resolutions approving the acquisition of the Company by Parent, the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and recommending that the Companys shareholders approve this Agreement as the "plan of merger" (as described in Section 302A.611 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the "MBCA")) for the merger contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has approved the execution of this Agreement and determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its shareholder; 

  

 WHEREAS, as an inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the Companys shareholders listed on Exhibit A to this Agreement are entering into voting agreements (the "Voting Agreements") with the Merger Sub of even date herewith covering a total of 15,673,095 shares outstanding; and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement. 

  

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

Article I 

   

THE MERGER 

  

 Section 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MBCA, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") on (i) the later of (A) the fifth Business Day (as defined below) following the satisfaction or waiver, if permissible, of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (as defined below) but subject to their satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver, at the Closing), or (B) if Merger Sub or Parent identifies an event or circumstance that constitutes or would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of any Anti-Bribery Law (as defined in Section 3.20), the tenth Business Day after Merger Sub or Parent identifies such likely violation, or (ii) on such other day as the parties may mutually agree. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") under the name "Medtronic ATS Medical, Inc." and shall continue its existence under the Laws (as defined below) of the State of Minnesota. In connection with the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. Upon the election of Parent, the Merger may be structured so that the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger 

   ##### 

  

 

Sub continuing as the Surviving Corporation; provided, that the Company shall
not be deemed to have breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, to the
extent such breach results from such election by Parent. 

   

 Section 1.02. _Consummation of the Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota duly executed articles of merger, as required by the MBCA, which may specify the date and time mutually agreed by the parties at which the Merger will become effective, and the parties shall take all such further actions as may be required by Law to make the Merger effective. Prior to the filing referred to in this Section, a closing (the "Closing") will be held at the offices of Fredrikson and Byron, P.A., 200 South Sixth Street, Suite 4000, Minneapolis, Minnesota (or such other place as the parties may mutually agree) for the purpose of confirming all the matters contained herein. The time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with applicable Law is referred to as the "Effective Time". 

  

 Section 1.03. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the MBCA. 

  

 Section 1.04. _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Articles of Incorporation of the Company shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in their entirety to read as the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall comply with Section 5.06(a) hereof), except that Article I thereof shall read as follows: "The name of the Corporation is Medtronic ATS Medical, Inc." and, as so amended, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as permitted by Law and this Agreement. The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall comply with Section 5.06(a) hereof), shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.05. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their respective death, permanent disability, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 

  

 Section 1.06. _Conversion of Shares_. Each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (each, a "Share"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary (as defined below) of Parent or the Company, all of which shall be canceled without any consideration being exchanged therefor, and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined below), which shall have only those rights set forth in Section 2.01) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive in cash an amount per Share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax (as defined below)) equal to the Merger Consideration (as defined below) without interest, upon the surrender of the certificate, if any, representing such Shares in accordance with Article II. At the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided herein. 

  

 Section 1.07. _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.08. _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger, or otherwise, such amounts as are required to be withheld under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 Section 1.09. _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets of the Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out the intent of this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the intent of this Agreement. 

  

Article II 

   

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES; OPTIONS 

  

 Section 2.01. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held of record or beneficially owned by a Person (as defined below) who has properly exercised and preserved and perfected dissenters rights with respect to such Shares under Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA and has not withdrawn or lost such rights ("Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Shares, but instead will be treated in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA unless and until such Person effectively withdraws or loses such Persons right to payment under Section 302A.473 of the MBCA (through failure to preserve or protect such right or otherwise). If, after the Effective Time, any such Person effectively withdraws or loses such right, then each such Dissenting Share held of record or beneficially owned by such Person will thereupon be treated as if it had been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will comply with all applicable provisions of the MBCA with respect to the Dissenting Shares. The Company will give Parent (a) prompt notice upon receipt by the Company at any time before the Effective Time of any written notice of intent to demand the fair value of any shares of Company common stock under Section 302A.473 of the MBCA and any withdrawal of any such notice and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to assertion of dissenters rights. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for payment of fair value for Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

 Section 2.02. _Payment for Shares_. (a) From time to time, as necessary, at or following the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit or cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") sufficient funds to make the payments due pursuant to Section 1.06 on a timely basis to holders of Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable 

   ##### 

  

 

instructions, make the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of
the Payment Fund. Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; provided, that (i) no such investment
or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the
holders of Shares and following any losses that result in the amount of funds
in the Payment Fund being insufficient to pay the portion of the aggregate
Merger Consideration that remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the shareholders of
the Company to the extent of such insufficiency and (ii) such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in
this Agreement. 

   

 (b) As of or promptly following the Effective Time, and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the later of the Effective Time or the date on which the Companys transfer agent has provided the Paying Agent with a list, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of the names and addresses of the Companys shareholders in electronic format customarily used by commercial transfer and paying agents, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who, as of the Effective Time, was the record holder of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.06: (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered are registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, that such documentation as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent is provided) and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.02, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate or represented by such Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. The Paying Agent shall accept Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal practices. 

  

 (c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such customary and reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not complied with this Section 2.02 prior to the end of such one-year period shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts (whether in respect of such Shares or otherwise) delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, any unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 2.03. _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

  

 Section 2.04. _Existing Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units and Warrants_. (a) Each option to purchase Shares ("Existing Stock Options") granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the Companys 1987 Stock Option and Stock Award Plan, as restated (the "1987 Plan") or the Companys 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2000 Plan" and, together with the 1987 Plan, the "Stock Plans"), or that is otherwise outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount, payable in cash as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Existing Stock Option as of the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of the Shares subject to such Existing Stock Option, less applicable withholding taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

  

 (b) Each restricted stock unit ("Existing Restricted Stock Units") granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the Companys Stock Plans or that is otherwise outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount, payable in cash as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares represented by such Existing Restricted Stock Unit as of the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less applicable withholding taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

  

 (c) Each warrant to purchase Shares ("Existing Warrants") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive, upon exercise of the warrants required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.19 following the Effective Time, an amount payable in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares with respect to which such Existing Warrant was exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of the Shares subject to such Existing Warrant as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable withholding taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

  

 Subject, in the case of each representation and warranty in this Article III, to Section 8.01(b), and except, with respect to any Section of this Article III, (i) as set forth in the section of the disclosure letter dated the date hereof and delivered by the Company to Parent with respect to this Agreement prior to the date hereof (the "Disclosure Letter") that specifically corresponds to such Section (or in any other section of the Disclosure Letter if the applicability of such disclosure to such Section of this Article III is reasonably apparent on its face) and (ii) as disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC (as defined below) or furnished by the Company to the SEC, in each case publicly available on EDGAR, on or after December 31, 2009 and at least five Business Days prior to the date hereof (to the extent such disclosure does not constitute a "risk factor" or forward-looking statement and such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face to relate to such Section of Article III below), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the following are true and correct: 

  

 Section 3.01. _Organization and Qualification_. Section 3.01 of the Disclosure Letter lists each Subsidiary of the Company. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a duly organized and validly existing entity in good standing (to the extent such concepts are recognized in the applicable jurisdiction) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with all corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as currently conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar governing documents) as currently in effect for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 3.01 of the Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, owns any interest in any Person other than the Companys Subsidiaries. 

  

 Section 3.02. _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 150,000,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share. None of the Companys authorized shares have been designated as other than Common Stock. As of the close of business on April 28, 2010, 78,944,469 Shares were issued and outstanding, no shares of capital stock of the Company other than the Shares were issued and outstanding, and no Shares were held in the Companys treasury.

Furthermore, as of such date, the Companys 6% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes") in an aggregate principal amount of $22,400,000 were outstanding. The Company has the right to call all of the outstanding 2025 Notes for redemption at a redemption price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption, at any time from the date of this Agreement until the maturity date of the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes are convertible only into the common stock of the Company and are not, until the Effective Time, convertible by the holders thereof into common stock of the Company at any price other than a Conversion Price (as such term is defined in the 2025 Notes) of $4.20. Since the close of business on April 28, 2010, the Company has not issued any Shares, has not granted any options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, other stock-based awards, warrants or rights or entered into any other 

   ##### 

  

 

agreements or commitments to issue any Shares, or granted any other awards in
respect of any Shares and has not split, combined or reclassified any of its
shares of capital stock. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are

Stock Option, Existing Restricted Stock Unit and Existing Warrant, the name of
each holder thereof, the number of outstanding Existing Stock Options,

Option was granted. Except for the Existing Stock Options, Existing
Restricted Stock Units, Existing Warrants and the 2025 Notes and except as

hereof no outstanding (i) securities of the Company convertible into or

Company (or, in each case, the economic equivalent thereof), (iii)
obligations of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any subscription,
warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or other similar
agreement or commitment relating to any capital stock, voting securities or

(iii), together with the capital stock of the Company, being referred to
collectively as "Company Securities") or (iv) obligations by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of
the Shares. There are on the date hereof no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any Company Securities. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to the voting of capital stock of the Company. All outstanding
securities of the Company have been offered and issued in compliance with all
applicable securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act") and "blue sky" laws. Any cancellation, re-grant or
other re-pricing or amendment transaction, with respect to options or other
rights to purchase Shares, was properly authorized and conducted in
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, including rules of the
National Association of Securities Dealers and Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority and applicable securities laws. 

   

 (b) The Company or another of its Subsidiaries is the record and beneficial owner of all the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, mortgage, pledge, charge, security interest or encumbrance of any kind, and there are no irrevocable proxies with respect to any such shares.

Company. 

   

 (c) The Companys past and current stock option and restricted stock unit grant practices (i) complied with the terms of the Stock Plans, stock exchange rules and applicable Laws, (ii) have been fairly presented in accordance with GAAP (as defined below) in the Companys financial statements set forth in the Company SEC Reports (as defined below), and (iii) with respect to stock options, have resulted only in exercise prices that correspond to the fair market value on the date that the grants were actually authorized under applicable Law. The Company has no ongoing internal review of its past and current stock option practice and has disclosed to Parent the results of any such review completed since December 31, 2007. 

  

 Section 3.03. _Authority for this Agreement; Board Action_. (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, other than, with respect to completion of the Merger, the approval of the plan of merger contained in this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares prior to the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub) constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (b) A committee of disinterested directors of the Companys Board of Directors (the "Special Committee") has unanimously adopted resolutions approving, including without limitation for purposes of Section 302A.673 of the MBCA, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Voting Agreements.

 Section 3.05. _Reports; Financial Statements_. (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.05(a) of the Disclosure Letter, since January 1, 2007, the Company has timely filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") ("SEC Reports"), all of which have complied as of their respective filing dates or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing made at least two Business Days prior to the date hereof, in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and, in each case, the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. No executive officer of the Company has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Company SEC Report. None of the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 2007 (the "Company SEC Reports"), including any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, at the time filed or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing made at least two Business Days prior to the date hereof, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to the Company SEC Reports. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. 

  

 (b) The audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements (including the related notes thereto) of the Company included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Reports have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of their respective dates, and the consolidated income, shareholders equity, results of operations and changes in consolidated financial position or cash flows for the periods presented therein (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). All of the Companys Subsidiaries are consolidated for accounting purposes. Except as set forth in Section 3.05(b) of the Disclosure Letter, the unaudited consolidated financial statements (including the related notes thereto) of the Company for the quarterly period ended April 3, 2010, when finalized and filed in the Companys Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended April 3, 2010, will not differ in any material respect (except for the inclusion of additional, 

   ##### 

  

 

consistent information) from the draft set forth in Section 3.05(b) of the
Disclosure Letter, and the contents of such Form 10-Q will not be
inconsistent in any material respect with the Companys press releases
containing preliminary results for such quarterly period. 

   

 (c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the description of such assessment set forth in Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 is accurate in all material respects. Except as set forth in Section 3.05(c) of the Disclosure Letter, the Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company by others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. A true, correct and complete summary of any such disclosures made by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee is set forth as Section 3.05(c) of the Disclosure Letter. As of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that the Companys outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when due. 

  

 (d) Since January 1, 2007, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of United States federal or state securities laws, material breach of fiduciary duty arising under United States federal or state law, or similar material violation of any United States federal or state law by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or to any of the officers listed on Section 8.09(g) of the Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (e) Except as set forth in Section 3.05(e) of the Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities of any nature, whether accrued, absolute, fixed, contingent or otherwise, whether due or to become due and whether or not required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet under GAAP, other than such liabilities (i) reflected or reserved against in the financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Reports filed and available prior to the date hereof, (ii) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2009.

All such reports, documents, claims and notices were complete and accurate in all material respects on the date filed or furnished (or were corrected in or supplemented by a subsequent filing) and remain complete and accurate. 

  

 (c) Except as set forth in Section 3.17(c) of the Disclosure Letter, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any Company Partner, has, since January 1, 2007, received any FDA Form 483, notice of adverse finding, Warning Letters, untitled letters or other correspondence or notice from the FDA, or other Governmental Entity (i) alleging or asserting noncompliance with any applicable Laws or Permits, and the Company and its Subsidiaries have no knowledge or reason to believe that the FDA or any other Governmental Entity is considering such action or (ii) contesting the investigational device exemption, premarket clearance or approval of, the uses of or the labeling or promotion of any Medical Devices.

Each such study listed in Part II of Section 3.17(e) of the Disclosure Letter has been conducted using clinical practices sufficient to allow the resulting data to be included in the Companys regulatory filings, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there is nothing included in such data that the Company believes would cause any such regulatory submission to be disallowed or delayed or that the Company believes would indicate that the relevant product will not perform as intended. If any data from the study listed at item 9 of Section 3.17(e) of the Disclosure Letter 

   ##### 

  

 

is necessary to be filed with any Governmental Entity in connection with any
regulatory submission, the inclusion of such data will not have a material
negative effect on such regulatory submission. The study listed at item 6 of
Section 3.17(e) of the Disclosure Letter was initially designed such that the
data therefrom could be used, but the resulting data is not intended to be
used, in regulatory submissions for such product. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not received any written notices, correspondence or other
communication from the FDA or any other Governmental Entity since January 1,
2007 requiring the termination, suspension or material modification of
any clinical trials conducted by, or on behalf of, the Company or its

that the FDA or any other Governmental Entity is considering such action.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the prior execution by such Person or group of a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of, and with terms at least as restrictive in all material respects on such Person or group as, the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) is on Parent (including the "standstill" provisions thereof), the Company may, at any time prior to the approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote of the holders of Shares, furnish information (so long as all such information has previously been made available to Parent or Merger Sub or is made available to Parent or Merger Sub prior to or concurrently with the time such information is made available to such Person or group) to or enter into discussions or negotiations with any Person or group that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal received after the date hereof and not resulting from a breach of this Section 5.02 only to the extent that (i) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account the legal, financial, financing and other aspects of such unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, that such unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal (as defined below), (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law and (iii) the Company has provided Parent prior written notice of its intent to take any such action at least one Business Day prior to taking such action. 

  

 (b) The Company will promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) (i) notify Parent if any such information is requested or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated, and (ii) communicate to Parent and Merger Sub the identity of the Person or group making such request or inquiry (the "Potential Acquirer") and the material terms of such request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal and (iii) shall provide copies of any written communications or other documents received from or sent to or on behalf of the Potential Acquirer that describe the financial or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal. The Company will keep Parent and Merger Sub reasonably informed of the status 

   ##### 

  

 

of any such discussions or negotiations and shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) notify Parent and Merger Sub of any modifications to the
financial or other material terms of any such request, inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal. 

   

 (c) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and Affiliates to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions, or negotiations with any Persons other than Parent and Merger Sub conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall notify any such Person with whom it has had any such discussions during the prior 180 days that the Company is no longer seeking the making of any Acquisition Proposal and thereby withdraws any request or consent theretofore given to the making of an Acquisition Proposal and shall request the return or destruction of any nonpublic information provided to any such Person in connection with any such activities, discussions or negotiations. 

  

 (d) Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.02(e), neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval of this Agreement or the Merger or its recommendation that the Companys shareholders approve this Agreement, in each case, as set forth in Section 3.03(b), (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) unless the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law (x) release any third party from any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party or (y) fail to enforce to the fullest extent possible, or grant any waiver, request or consent to any Acquisition Proposal under, any such agreement or (iv) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with Section 5.02(a)) related to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to the Parent or Merger Sub, its recommendation (any such action, a "Recommendation Change") that the Companys shareholders approve this Agreement as follows (and only as follows): 

  

 (i) if a material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances that was not known by the Board of Directors of the Company as of or at any time prior to the date of this Agreement (other than, and not relating in any way to, an Acquisition Proposal, it being understood and hereby agreed that the Company Board may only effect a Recommendation Change in response to or in connection with an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 5.02(e)(ii)_ ) (such material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances, an "Intervening Event") shall have occurred and be continuing; _provided that_ (A) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action in light of the Intervening Event would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company shareholders under Minnesota Law, (B) the Company shall have provided at least three Business Days prior written notice (the "Notice Period") to Parent of its intention to take such action and concurrently provided Parent with a written explanation of the basis and rationale of the Board of Directors of the Company for proposing to effect such Recommendation Change, (C) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent during the Notice Period to enable Parent to propose changes to the terms of this Agreement that would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such Recommendation Change, (D) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and determined that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of its fiduciary 

    ##### 

  

    

duties if such changes were to be given effect, and (E) in the event of any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening
Event, the Company shall have delivered to Parent an additional notice and
the Notice Period shall have recommenced, or 

   

 (ii) if (A) the Company has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a violation of this Section 5.02, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account the legal, financial, financing and other aspects of such unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, that such unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that it intends to accept or recommend such Acquisition Proposal as a Superior Proposal, (C) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, (D) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of its intent to take any such action at least four Business Days prior to taking such action, including all of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, (a "Notice of Superior Proposal"), (E) during such four Business Day period, the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent and Merger Sub (to the extent that Parent and Merger Sub wish to negotiate) to enable Parent and Merger Sub to make an offer that is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as such Acquisition Proposal, (F) Parent and Merger Sub do not, within such four Business Day period, make an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account the legal, financial, financing and other aspects of the proposal, to be at least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that, in the event of any amendment to the financial or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver to Parent and Merger Sub an additional written Notice of Superior Proposal, and the four Business Day period referenced above shall expire on the later of (x) four Business Days after Parents and Merger Subs receipt of each such additional Notice of Superior Proposal or (y) the original expiration date of the four Business Day period, and (G) the Companys Board of Directors, after taking into account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger offered by Parent and Merger Sub after receipt of such notice, continues to believe that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. Without limiting any other rights of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement in respect of any such action, any withdrawal, modification or qualification by the Board of Directors of the Company of the approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or any termination of this Agreement under Section 7.01(g) shall not have any effect on the approvals of, and other actions referred to herein for the purpose of causing Takeover Laws and Section 8 of the Confidentiality Agreement to be inapplicable to Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, which approvals and actions are irrevocable, in each case to the extent permissible under applicable Law. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel) failure to do so would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to shareholders under applicable Law, or otherwise violate its obligations under applicable Law; provided, however, that no such action or disclosure may have any of the effects set forth in Section 5.02(d) or Section 5.02(e) unless the Company shall have first complied with its obligations in Section 5.02(e). 

  

 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal, or any indication of interest in making an offer or proposal, made by a Person or group at any time which is structured to permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of any material portion of the assets (other than inventory purchased in the ordinary course of business) of, or at least 15% of the capital 

   ##### 

  

 

stock, equity interest in, or businesses of, the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, pursuant to a merger, recapitalization,
consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock
or equity interests, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or
similar transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series
of related transactions, in each case other than the Merger and (ii) "Superior
Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal (except the
references therein to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%") made in writing, in
respect of which the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and
outside legal counsel and after taking into account the legal, financial,
financing and other aspects of such unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal, would result in a transaction that is (x) more favorable, from a
financial point of view, to the shareholders of the Company than the
Merger (after taking into account any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement and the Merger offered by Parent and Merger Sub) and (y) reasonably
likely to be consummated without unreasonable delay. 

   

 Section 5.03. _Access to Information_. (a) From and after the date of this Agreement, subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the Company will (i) give Parent and Merger Sub and their authorized accountants, investment bankers, counsel and other representatives reasonable access (during regular business hours upon reasonable notice) to such employees, plants, offices, warehouses and other facilities at reasonable times and to such books, contracts, commitments and records (including Tax returns) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request and instruct the Companys and its Subsidiaries independent public accountants to provide access to their work papers and such other information as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request, (ii) permit Parent and Merger Sub to make such inspections as they may reasonably require, (iii) cause its officers and those of its Subsidiaries to furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may from time to time reasonably request, (iv) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain when available consistent with past practice all unblinded clinical trial data with respect to the clinical trials listed in Section 5.03 of the Disclosure Letter, and, as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnish to Parent or Merger Sub all such data and any other data or other information resulting from any of the studies listed in Section 3.17(e) of the Disclosure Letter that implicates patient safety or product efficacy, and (v) furnish promptly to Parent and Merger Sub a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during such period pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access, inspections, data or other information to the extent that to do so (x) may cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney work product protection, or (y) would violate a confidentiality obligation to any Person; provided, however, that that Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents to provide such access, inspections, data or other information and take such other action (such as the redaction of identifying or confidential information, or by providing such access, inspections, data or other information solely to outside counsel, or executing other documents or taking other action reasonably requested by Parent to avoid the loss of attorney-client privilege) as is necessary to provide such access, inspections, data or other information to Parent and Merger Sub in compliance with applicable law. 

  

 (b) Information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 5.03(a) shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.04. _Shareholder Approval_. The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Special Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder approval required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. Except as 

   ##### 

  

 

specifically permitted by paragraphs (d) and (e) of Section 5.02, the Board
of Directors of the Company shall continue to recommend that the Companys
shareholders vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the
shareholder vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement required to
consummate the Merger. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
in accordance with Section 7.01 (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Section 7.01(g)), the Company shall submit this Agreement to its shareholders
for approval without regard to whether the Board of Directors of the Company
has withdrawn, modified or qualified, or has publicly proposed to withdraw,
modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, its
recommendation that the Companys shareholders approve this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.05. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts: (A) to make promptly any required submissions under the HSR Act and any applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws which the Company or Parent determines should be made, in each case, with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) to furnish information required in connection with such submissions under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law, (C) to keep the other parties reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such submissions under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law, including with respect to: (1) the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (2) the expiration of any waiting period, (3) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding under the HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law and (4) the nature and status of any objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised under the HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and (D) to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, clearances and approvals from any Governmental Entity and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one another: (A) in promptly determining whether any filings are required to be or should be made or consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained under any other supranational, national, federal, state, foreign or local Law or regulation or whether any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other contracts or instruments material to the Companys business in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers. 

  

 (b) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly notify the others of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any communication to such Person from a Governmental Entity and permit the others to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the others in relation to) any proposed written communication to a Governmental Entity and (ii) keep the others reasonably informed of any developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the Merger, provided, that neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to take any of the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, to the extent that any Governmental Entity has expressly requested or instructed the Company or Parent, as applicable, not to take any such action. 

  

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law or if any investigation, litigation or other administrative or judicial action or 

   

\- 34 -

##### 

 

  

proceeding is commenced or proposed or threatened to be commenced challenging
any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act, FTC
Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law or which would
otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, then each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve, and to
cooperate and assist the other parties in resolving, any such objections,
investigation or litigation, action or proceeding. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, any of its subsidiaries or
the Surviving Corporation, will be required (and the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Parent, agree, but shall, if so
directed by the Parent, agree, effective after the Effective Time) to hold
separate or divest any of their respective assets or operations or enter into
any consent decree or licensing or other arrangement with respect to any of
their assets or operations or to otherwise take or commit to take any action
that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
as of and after the Effective Time any businesses or assets of the Company,
the Parent or any of their respective affiliates. 

   

 (d) If any litigation or other administrative or judicial action is commenced challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (e) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall they permit their respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets (except in each case pursuant to any agreement in effect on the date hereof), if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, could reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining the applicable clearance, approval or waiver under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.06. _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified Person") as provided in the Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, or the articles of organization, bylaws or similar constituent documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or under any agreement listed on Section 3.16 of the Disclosure Letter, as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to or at the Effective Time (including such matters that arise in whole or in part out of or pertain to this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby) and regardless of whether or not asserted or claimed prior to or at or after the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than the statutes of limitations applicable to such matters. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, honor and fulfill in all respects such obligations. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and pay for in full, in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective Time (including such acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), policies of directors and officers liability insurance (which may take the form of an extended reporting period, endorsement or policy) covering the Company and other Persons currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policies, for a period of six years after the Effective Time; provided that if the aggregate premiums for such policies exceeds $250,000, the Company shall first consult with Parent 

   ##### 

  

 

and shall obtain and pay for such policies only on terms reasonably acceptable
to Parent. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
not take any action to cancel such policies. This covenant shall not be
considered satisfied by the Company in all material respects if the Company
fails to obtain the insurance described in the first sentence of this
Section. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Person notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time that a claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) has been made against such Indemnified Person, the provisions of this Section 5.06 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

  

 (d) This Section 5.06 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and legal representatives. 

  

 (e) If the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers of conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.06. In addition , the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.06. 

  

 Section 5.07. _Employee Matters_. (a) With respect to each employee benefit plan of Parent ("Parent Benefit Plan") in which the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the "Company Employees") participate after the Effective Time, for purposes of determining vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement, service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent; provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized under the applicable Company Plan. If applicable and to the extent possible under Parent Benefit Plans (as reasonably amended to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable law), Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under Parent Benefit Plans to be waived with respect to such Company Employees and their eligible dependents and shall provide them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) made during the plan year including the Effective Time for the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any Parent Benefit Plans in which they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide to Parent a true, complete and accurate list of all employees that have been terminated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since the date of this Agreement and through the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) to terminate employment or change the place of work, responsibilities, status or description of any employee or group of employees, or (ii) to terminate any employee benefit plan without establishing a replacement plan to the extent the Company would have had such right prior to the Effective Time, in each case as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may determine in its discretion. 

   #####

PROMISSORY NOTE 

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
     $30,000,000   |   | _ _, 2010  
     |   |   
   

  

 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, each of ATS Medical, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("ATS"), and its subsidiaries signatory hereto (collectively "Borrower"), jointly and severally promises to pay to the order of Medtronic, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Lender"), at its office located at 710 Medtronic Parkway, Minneapolis, Minnesota, or at such other place as may be designated from time to time by the holder hereof, in lawful money of the United States of America, the principal sum of Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000), or such lesser amount as may be advanced to Borrower hereunder, together with interest on the unpaid principal balance hereof from the date hereof until this Promissory Note (this "Note") is fully paid, at an annual rate of interest that shall at all times be equal to the Interest Rate (as defined below), calculated on the basis of actual number of days elapsed in a 365 day year. As used herein, "Interest Rate" shall mean the annual rate of interest equal to 10%. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note, if during any period for which interest is computed hereunder, the amount of interest computed on the basis provided for in this Note, together with all fees, charges and other payments which are treated as interest under applicable law, as provided for herein or in any other document executed in connection herewith, would exceed the amount of such interest computed on the basis of the Highest Lawful Rate (as defined below), Borrower shall not be obligated to pay, and Lender shall not be entitled to charge, collect, receive, reserve or take interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, and during any such period the interest payable hereunder shall be computed on the basis of the Highest Lawful Rate. As used herein, "Highest Lawful Rate" means the maximum non-usurious rate of interest, as in effect from time to time, which may be charged, contracted for, reserved, received or collected by Lender in connection with this Note under applicable law. 

 

 _Advances_  

  

Following the date of this Note until the termination of the Merger Agreement
(as defined below), the Borrower may request an advance under this Note
(each, an "Advance"), _provided_ ,  _that_ the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of all outstanding loans hereunder shall not exceed $30,000,000 (the
"Commitment") at any time. Upon five (5) Business Days written notification
from Lender to Borrower that the principal amount outstanding hereunder
exceeds the Commitment, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender, in cash, the
amount of such excess. Each time the Borrower desires to obtain an Advance
(which shall not be more often than one time per month), such request shall
be (a) in writing, (b) signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the
Borrower, (c) faxed to the Lender at (763) 505-2700, Attention: Treasury
Department, and (d) e-mailed to Lender at
_rs.corporatetreasury@medtronic.com_ , and must be given so as to be received
by the Lender not later than 11:00 a.m., Minneapolis time, on the date which
is three (3) Business Days before the date of the requested Advance. Each
request for an Advance shall specify (i) the borrowing date (which shall be a
Business Day), (ii) the amount of such Advance (which shall be in increments
of $1,000,000), and (iii) the wire transfer instructions for the Advance. Any
request for an Advance shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower
that no event has occurred and is continuing, or will result from such
Advance, which constitutes an Event of Default or any event which, with the
giving of notice to the Borrower or lapse of 

      ##### 

  

    

time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default ("Default"). If the
foregoing and following conditions precedent have been satisfied: 

    

 (a) no Event of Default or Default exists or would result from such Advance; 

   

 (b) before and immediately after giving effect to such Advance, all of the representations and warranties of the Borrower in this Note (to the extent, if at all, such representations and warranties have been modified by disclosures made in writing to, and approved in writing by, the Lender) shall be true and correct in all material respects as though made on the date of such Advance (other than representations and warranties that relate to a specific date, which shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such date); 

   

 (c) the Borrower has not made any material misrepresentation or omission in disclosures to the Lender in connection with the Merger Agreement; 

   

 (d) the Borrower has not experienced any Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement); and 

   

 (e) to the extent requested by Lender, all necessary filings have been made in each applicable jurisdiction and all other actions, including without limitation, delivery of stock certificates to Lender, have occurred to perfect Lenders security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement), 

 

then Lender shall make the amount of the requested Advance available to the
Borrower at the account specified in the advance request, in immediately
available funds not later than 5:00 p.m., Minneapolis time, on the requested
borrowing date. The Borrower shall be obligated to repay all Advances made by
Lender that the Lender reasonably determines were requested on behalf of
the Borrower notwithstanding the fact that the person requesting the same was
not in fact authorized to do so. The Lender shall enter in its records the
amount of each Advance hereunder, and the payments made hereon, and such
records shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the subject matter thereof,
absent manifest error. This Note is a multiple advance facility, but it is not
a revolving facility, and therefore the Borrower may not borrow, repay and
reborrow amounts hereunder. 

  

 _Payment of Interest and Principal_  

   

 Interest shall be payable monthly, in arrears, on the first day of each month following funding of this Note. The entire unpaid principal balance of this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable in full twenty-four months following the termination for any reason of the Merger Agreement (defined below) ("Expiration Date"). Upon final payment of this Note (whether upon the Expiration Date or upon prepayment in full), Borrower shall pay, in addition to the then outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest, a final payment equal to six percent (6%) of the original principal balance of this Note. 

   ##### 

  

  

 For purposes of this Note, "Merger Agreement" shall mean that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 28, 2010 among Pilgrim Merger Corporation, Lender and ATS. 

 

 _Prepayment_  

   

 The principal balance of this Note may be prepaid in whole or in part from time to time on any interest payment date, without penalty or premium, if Borrower gives Lender at least three (3) Business Days prior notice to Lender. 

 

 _Manner of Payments_  

   

 Payments and prepayments of principal of, and interest on, this Note and all fees, expenses and other obligations under this Note, the Security Agreements (as defined below), and any other documents executed in connection herewith, excluding the Merger Agreement and the documents executed in connection therewith, (collectively, the "Loan Documents") shall be made without set-off or counterclaim in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m., Minneapolis time, on the dates due wired to the following account of the Lender pursuant to the following instructions: 

 



  



  



  



 



   



  

Funds received on any day after such time shall be deemed to have been
received on the next Business Day (as defined below). Whenever any payment to
be made hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be stated to be due
on a day which is not a Business Day (as defined below), such payment shall
be made on the next succeeding business day and such extension of time shall
be included in the computation of any interest or fees. As used herein,
"Business Day" means a day of the year (other than a Saturday, Sunday, legal
holiday or other day on which banking institutions in Minnesota are
authorized or required by law to close) in which Lender is open for the
purpose of conducting commercial business. 

  

 _Application of Payments_  

   

 Any payment hereunder shall be applied first to the payment of outstanding reasonable costs and expenses payable pursuant to this Note, second to accrued interest and then to the reduction of principal. 

 

 _Use of Proceeds_  

   

 The proceeds of any Advance shall be used solely (i) to redeem the approximately $22,400,000 (principal amount plus interest) owed on the Borrowers 6% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2025, (ii) to repay the approximately $3,100,000 (principal amount plus interest, prepayment fees and final payment fees) outstanding on the term loan from Silicon Valley Bank, 

   ##### 

  

 

(iii) prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement, to finance working
capital, and/or (iv) after the termination of the Merger Agreement, for
general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice. The Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Advance under
this Note to pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to its
capital stock to its shareholders. 

  

 _Security_  

   

 This Note is secured by a Security Agreement ("Security Agreement") and a Pledge Agreement ("Pledge Agreement") each dated the date hereof between Lender and Borrower. 

 

 _Representations and Warranties_  

   

 To induce the Lender to accept this Note and to advance the proceeds hereof to the Borrower, the Borrower represents and warrants to Lender as follows: 

   

 (a) _Power_. Each Borrower has all requisite power and authority to carry on its businesses as now conducted, to enter into the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party. 

   

 (b) _Authorization and Validity_. The execution, delivery and performance by each Borrower of the Loan Documents to which such Borrower is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary company action by such Borrower, and the Loan Documents constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower thereto, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, subject to limitations as to enforceability which might result from bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject to limitations on the availability of equitable remedies. 

   

 (c) _No Conflict; No Default_. The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which such Borrower is a party, including such Borrowers receipt and use of the proceeds of the borrowing evidenced by this Note, will not (a) violate any provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any court, governmental agency or arbitrator presently in effect having applicability to such Borrower, (b) violate or contravene any provisions of such Borrowers organizational or governing documents, or (c) result in a breach of or constitute a default under any indenture, loan or credit agreement or any other agreement, lease or instrument to which such Borrower is a party or by which such Borrower or any of its properties may be bound or result in the creation of any lien, security interest or other encumbrance (collectively, "Liens") on any of its assets, other than Liens in favor of Lender and other than Permitted Liens (as defined in the Security Agreement). None of the Borrower is in default under or in violation of any such law, statute, rule or regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award or any such indenture, loan or credit agreement or other agreement, lease or instrument in any material respect which would be expected to have a material adverse effect. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) _Financial Statements and Condition_. The financial statements of the Borrower, as heretofore furnished to Lender by the Borrower, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition of each Borrower as of the dates specified therein and the results of its operations and changes in financial position for the periods ended as of the dates specified therein.

Exhibit A to Promissory Note 

  

THIS WARRANT AND THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE

TRANSFERRED UNLESS (I) THIS WARRANT AND THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES HAVE BEEN
REGISTERED FOR SALE PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES ACT OR (II) THE COMPANY HAS
RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT SUCH
TRANSFER MAY LAWFULLY BE MADE WITHOUT REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OR QUALIFICATION UNDER APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. 

   

 _WARRANT_  

  

 THIS CERTIFIES THAT, for value received, Medtronic, Inc., a Minnesota corporation or its permitted assigns (the " _Holder_ ") is entitled to subscribe for and purchase up to _ _ fully paid and nonassessable shares (the " _Shares_ ") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), of ATS Medical, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the " _Company_ "), at $2.61 per share (such price and such other price as shall result, from time to time, from the adjustments specified in Section 4 hereof is herein referred to as the " _Warrant Price_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth. This warrant is being issued on this ___day of _ _, 20___(the " _Date of Grant_ "). 

  

 This warrant is being issued in connection with that certain Promissory Note dated as of  _ _, 2010 (the " _Note_ "), issued by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries in favor of the Holder. Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Note. 

  

 1. _Term_. The right represented by this warrant is exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time beginning on the Date of Grant (the " _Initial Exercise Date_ ") and ending on the seven-year anniversary of the Date of Grant. 

  

 2. _Method of Exercise; Payment; Issuance of New Warrant_. Subject to Section 1 hereof, the purchase right represented by this warrant may be exercised by the Holder hereof, in whole or in part and from time to time, at the election of the Holder hereof, as applicable, after the Initial Exercise Date. At the time the Holder elects to exercise this warrant, the Holder shall (i) surrender this warrant (with the notice of exercise substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 duly completed and executed) at the principal office of the Company and by the payment to the Company, by certified or bank check, or by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company (a " _Wire Transfer_ ") of an amount equal to the then applicable Warrant Price multiplied by the number of Shares then being purchased; or (ii) exercise the "net issuance" right provided for in Section 9 hereof. In the event of any exercise of the rights represented by this warrant pursuant to this Section 2, certificates for the shares of stock so purchased shall be delivered to the Holder hereof as soon as practicable and in any event within three (3) business days after such exercise and, unless this warrant has been fully exercised or 

   ##### 

  

 

expired, a new warrant representing the portion of the Shares, if any, with
respect to which this warrant shall not then have been exercised shall also
be issued to the Holder hereof as soon as practicable and in any event within
such thirty-day period; provided, however, if requested by the Holder of this
warrant, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent
to deliver the certificate representing Shares issued upon exercise of this
warrant to a broker or other person (as directed by the Holder exercising
this warrant) within the time period required to settle any trade made by the
Holder after exercise of this warrant. 

  

The person or persons in whose name(s) any certificate(s) representing shares
of Common Stock shall be issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be
deemed to have become the holder(s) of record of, and shall be treated for
all purposes as the record holder(s) of, the shares represented thereby (and
such shares shall be deemed to have been issued) immediately prior to the
close of business on the date or dates upon which this warrant is
exercised. 

   

 3. _Stock Fully Paid; Reservation of Shares_. All Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by this warrant will, upon issuance pursuant to the terms and conditions herein, be fully paid and nonassessable, and free from all preemptive rights and taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof. During the period within which the rights represented by this warrant may be exercised, the Company will at all times have authorized, and reserved for the purpose of the issue upon exercise of the purchase rights evidenced by this warrant, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by this warrant. If at any time during the term of this warrant the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to permit exercise of this warrant, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes. 

  

 4. _Adjustment of Warrant Price and Number of Shares_. The number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of this warrant and the Warrant Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, as follows: 

  

 (a) _Reclassification or Merger_. In case of any reclassification or change of securities of the class issuable upon exercise of this warrant (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), or in case of any merger of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a merger with another corporation in which the Company is the acquiring and the surviving corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or change of outstanding securities issuable upon exercise of this warrant), the Company, or such successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall (i) in the case of a merger described above, execute and deliver to the Holder a new warrant (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder), so that the Holder shall have the right to receive, upon exercise of this warrant, at a total purchase price equal to that payable upon the exercise of the unexercised portion of this warrant, and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock theretofore issuable upon exercise of this warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities, money and property receivable upon such merger or sale by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock then purchasable under this warrant and (ii) in the case of a reclassification or change in the securities issuable upon 

      ##### 

  

    

exercise of this warrant described above, the Holder shall have the right to
receive, upon exercise of this warrant, at a total purchase price equal to
that payable upon the exercise of the unexercised portion of this warrant,
and (A) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock theretofore issuable upon
exercise of this warrant, the number of shares of Common Stock then
purchasable under this warrant upon such reclassification or other change in
the securities issuable upon exercise of this warrant or (B) in lieu of cash
theretofore issuable upon exercise of this warrant, the amount of cash then
issuable under this warrant upon such reclassification or other change in
the securities issuable upon exercise of this warrant. Any new warrant shall
provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 4\. The
provisions of this Section 4(a) shall similarly apply to
successive reclassifications, changes, mergers and sales. 

   

 (b) _Subdivision or Combination of Shares_. If the Company at any time while this warrant remains outstanding and unexpired shall subdivide or combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Warrant Price shall be proportionately decreased and the number of Shares issuable hereunder shall be proportionately increased in the case of a subdivision and the Warrant Price shall be proportionately increased and the number of Shares issuable hereunder shall be proportionately decreased in the case of a combination. 

   

 (c) _Stock Dividends and Other Distributions_. If the Company at any time while this warrant is outstanding and unexpired shall (i) pay a dividend with respect to Common Stock payable in Common Stock, then the Warrant Price shall be adjusted, from and after the date of determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, to that price determined by multiplying the Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such date of determination by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such dividend or distribution, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution; or (ii) make any other distribution with respect to Common Stock (except any distribution specifically provided for in Sections 4(a) and 4(b)), then, in each such case, provision shall be made by the Company such that the Holder of this warrant shall receive upon exercise of this warrant a proportionate share of any such dividend or distribution as though it were the holder of the Common Stock as of the record date fixed for the determination of the shareholders of the Company entitled to receive such dividend or distribution. 

   

 (d) _Adjustment of Number of Shares_. Upon each adjustment in the Warrant Price, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder shall be adjusted, rounded up to the nearest whole share, to the product obtained by multiplying the number of Shares purchasable immediately prior to such adjustment in the Warrant Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Warrant Price immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which shall be the Warrant Price immediately thereafter. 

   

 5. _Notice of Adjustments_. Whenever the Warrant Price or the number of Shares purchasable hereunder shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 4 hereof, the Company shall make a certificate signed by its acting chief financial officer setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment 

   ##### 

  

 

was calculated, and the Warrant Price and the number of Shares purchasable
hereunder after giving effect to such adjustment, and shall cause copies of
such certificate to be mailed to the Holder of this warrant. 

   

 6. _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued in connection with any exercise hereunder, but in lieu of such fractional shares the Company shall make a cash payment therefor based on the product resulting from multiplying the then fair market value of the Common Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 9(c) below) on the date of exercise by such fraction. 

  

 7. _Compliance with Act; Disposition of Warrant or Shares of Common Stock_. 

  

 (a) _Compliance with Act_. The Holder of this warrant, by acceptance hereof, agrees that this warrant, and the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise hereof are being acquired for investment and that such Holder will not offer, sell or otherwise dispose of this warrant, or any shares of Common Stock except under circumstances which will not result in a violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or any applicable state securities laws. Upon exercise of this warrant, unless the Shares being acquired are registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available, the Holder hereof shall confirm in writing that the shares of Common Stock so purchased are being acquired for investment and not with a view toward distribution or resale in violation of the Securities Act and shall confirm such other matters related thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Company. This warrant and all shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of this warrant (unless registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws) shall be stamped or imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form: 

    

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR ANY STATE
SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED
UNLESS (I) SUCH SECURITIES HAVE BEEN REGISTERED FOR SALE PURSUANT TO THE
SECURITIES ACT OR (II) THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT SUCH TRANSFER MAY LAWFULLY BE MADE
WITHOUT REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR QUALIFICATION UNDER
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. 

 

Said legend shall be removed by the Company, upon the request of a Holder, at
such time as the restrictions on the transfer of the applicable security have
terminated. 

   

 (b) _Disposition of Warrant or Shares_. This warrant and any shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise or conversion of this warrant may be transferred only pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration. Subject to such restrictions, the Company shall transfer this warrant from time to time upon the books to be maintained by the Company for that purpose, upon surrender thereof 

      ##### 

  

    

for transfer properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instructions for
transfer and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Company, including, if required by the Company, an opinion of counsel to the
effect that such transfer is exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act to establish that such transfer is being made in accordance
with the terms hereof, and a new warrant shall be issued to the transferee
and the surrendered warrant shall be canceled by the Company. Each
certificate representing this warrant or the shares of Common Stock thus
transferred (except a transfer pursuant to Rule 144 or 144A) shall bear a
legend as to the applicable restrictions on transferability in order to
ensure compliance with such laws, unless such legend is not required in order
to ensure compliance with such laws. The Company may issue stop transfer
instructions to its transfer agent in connection with such restrictions. 

   

 (c) _Applicability of Restrictions_. Neither any restrictions of any legend described in this warrant nor the requirements of Section 7(b) above shall apply to any transfer of, or grant of a security interest in, this warrant (or the Common Stock obtainable upon exercise hereof) or any part hereof (i) to a partner of the Holder if the Holder is a partnership or to a member of the Holder if the Holder is a limited liability company, (ii) to a partnership of which the Holder is a partner or to a limited liability company of which the Holder is a member, or (iii) to any affiliate of the Holder if the Holder is a corporation; provided, however, in any such transfer, if applicable, the transferee shall on the Companys request agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this warrant as if an original Holder hereof. 

   

 8. _Rights as Shareholders; Information_. No Holder of this warrant, as such, shall be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise hereof for any purpose, nor shall anything contained herein be construed to confer upon the Holder of this warrant, as such, any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to shareholders at any meeting thereof, or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive dividends or subscription rights or otherwise until this warrant shall have been exercised and the Shares purchasable upon the exercise hereof shall have become deliverable, as provided herein. 

  

 9. _Right to Convert Warrant into Stock: Net Issuance_. 

  

 (a) _Right to Convert_. In addition to and without limiting the rights of the Holder under the terms of this warrant, the Holder shall have the right to convert this warrant or any portion thereof (the " _Conversion Right_ ") into shares of Common Stock as provided in this Section 9 at any time or from time to time during the term of this warrant. Upon exercise of the Conversion Right with respect to a particular number of shares subject to this warrant (the " _Converted Warrant Shares_ "), the Company shall deliver to the Holder (without payment by the Holder of any exercise price or any cash or other consideration) that number of shares of fully paid and nonassessable Common Stock as is determined according to the following formula: 

   

 X = (B  A) divided by Y 

  

 Where: X = the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be issued to Holder 

  

 Y = the fair market value of one share of Common Stock 

   ##### 

  

   

A = the aggregate Warrant Price of the specified number of Converted Warrant
Shares immediately prior to the exercise of the Conversion Right _(i.e._ ,
the number of Converted Warrant Shares multiplied by the Warrant Price) 

   

B = the aggregate fair market value of the specified number of Converted
Warrant Shares ( _i.e._ , the number of Converted Warrant Shares multiplied
by the fair market value of one Converted Warrant Share) 

 

If shares of Common Stock are issuable pursuant to this Section 9, no
fractional shares shall be issuable upon exercise of the Conversion Right,
and, if the number of shares to be issued determined in accordance with the
foregoing formula is other than a whole number, the Company shall pay to the
Holder an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of the resulting
fractional share on the Conversion Date (as hereinafter defined). 

   

 (b) _Method of Exercise_. The Conversion Right may be exercised by the Holder by the surrender of this warrant at the principal office of the Company together with a written statement (which may be in the form of Exhibit A-1) specifying that the Holder thereby intends to exercise the Conversion Right and indicating the number of shares subject to this warrant which are being surrendered (referred to in Section 9(a) hereof as the Converted Warrant Shares) in exercise of the Conversion Right. Such conversion shall be effective upon receipt by the Company of this warrant together with the aforesaid written statement, or on such later date as is specified therein (the " _Conversion Date_ "). Certificates for the shares issuable upon exercise of the Conversion Right and, if applicable, a new warrant evidencing the balance of the shares remaining subject to this warrant, shall be issued as of the Conversion Date and shall be delivered to the Holder within thirty (30) days following the Conversion Date. 

   

 (c) _Determination of Fair Market Value_. For purposes of this Section 9, " _fair market value_ " of a share of Common Stock as of a particular date (the " _Determination Date_ ") shall mean: (i) if traded on a securities exchange, the fair market value of the Common Stock shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the Common Stock on such exchange over the five trading days immediately prior to the Determination Date as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets (or a comparable reporting service of national reputation selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Holder if Bloomberg Financial Markets is not then reporting sales prices of such security) (collectively, " _Bloomberg_ "); (ii) if traded on a market that is not a securities exchange, the fair market value of the Common Stock shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the five trading days immediately prior to the Determination Date as reported by Bloomberg; and (iii) if there is no public market for the Common Stock, then fair market value shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith. 

   

 (d) _Automatic Exercise_ : If this Warrant would terminate or expire but for the application of this Section 9(d), then if the fair market value of one share of Common Stock exceeds the Warrant Price this Warrant shall be deemed automatically converted pursuant to this Section 9 immediately prior to such termination or expiration. 

   

 10\. _Representations and Warranties_. The Company represents and warrants to the Holder of this warrant as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) This warrant has been duly authorized and executed by the Company and is a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and the rules of law or principles at equity governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. 

   

 (b) The Shares have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance by the Company and, when issued in accordance with the terms hereof, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from preemptive rights. 

   

 (c) The execution and delivery of this warrant are not, and the issuance of the Shares upon exercise of this warrant in accordance with the terms hereof will not be, inconsistent with the Companys articles of incorporation or bylaws, do not and will not contravene any law, governmental rule or regulation, judgment or order applicable to the Company, and do not and will not conflict with or contravene any provision of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, contract or other instrument of which the Company is a party or by which it is bound or require the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, the registration or filing with or the taking of any action in respect of or by, any federal, state or local government authority or agency or other person, except for the filing of notices pursuant to federal and state securities laws, which filings will be effected by the time required thereby. 

   

 11. _Registration Rights_. 

  

 (a) If requested by the Holder (the " _Demand Registration Right_ "), the Company shall prepare and, as soon as practicable but in no event later than 30 calendar days after receiving such a request from the Holder (the " _Filing Deadline_ "), file with the Commission a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the " _Registration Statement_ ") covering the resale of all of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of any Warrants issued to the Holder under the Note on or before the date of such demand (the " _Registrable Securities_ "). The Holder shall have only one Demand Registration Right, and such Demand Registration Right shall apply to all Registrable Securities issuable to Holder on or before the date of the demand upon the exercise of the Warrants issued by the Company to the Holder in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Note. 

   

 (b) The Registration Statement prepared pursuant hereto shall register the Registrable Securities for resale, including the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants by the Holder from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by such Holder. The Company shall use its best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the Commission as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 calendar days after the Filing Deadline (the " _Effectiveness Deadline_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Commission reviews the Registration Statement and requires the Company to make modifications thereto, then the Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to 120 calendar days after the Filing Deadline. In the event that, before the Registration Statement is declared effective, the offices of the Securities and Exchange Commission are closed due to acts of God, war or terror (or similar circumstances), the Effectiveness Deadline will be extended by a number of days equal to the days of any such closure. 

      ##### 

  

     

 12. _Modification and Waiver_. This warrant and any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the same is sought. 

  

 13. _Notices_. Any notice, request, communication or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder hereof or the Company shall be delivered, or shall be sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, to each such Holder at its address as shown on the books of the Company or to the Company at the address indicated therefore on the signature page of this warrant. 

  

 14. _Binding Effect on Successors_.

 15. _Lost Warrants or Stock Certificates_. The Company covenants to the Holder hereof that, upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this warrant or any stock certificate and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender and cancellation of such warrant or stock certificate, the Company will make and deliver a new warrant or stock certificate, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated warrant or stock certificate. 

  

 16. _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings of the various sections of this warrant are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this warrant. The language in this warrant shall be construed as to its fair meaning without regard to which party drafted this warrant. 

  

 17. _Governing Law_. This warrant shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the laws of the State of Minnesota. 

  

 18. _Remedies_. In case any one or more of the covenants and agreements contained in this warrant shall have been breached, the Holder hereof (in the case of a breach by the Company), or the Company (in the case of a breach by the Holder), may proceed to protect and enforce their or its rights either by suit in equity and/or by action at law, including, but not limited to, an action for damages as a result of any such breach and/or an action for specific performance of any such covenant or agreement contained in this warrant. 

  

 19. _No Impairment of Rights_. The Company will not, by amendment of its articles of incorporation or through any other means, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Holder of this warrant against impairment. 

   ##### 

  

  

 20. _Severability_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this warrant in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction, or affect any other provision of this warrant, which shall remain in full force and effect.

 THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of _ _, 2010, is made and given by ATS Acquisition, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Pledgor"), to Medtronic, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and its endorsees and assigns (the "Lender"). 

  

RECITALS 

  

 A. Pledgor and two of its affiliates, have executed and delivered to the Lender a Note dated as of the date hereof in the original principal amount of $30,000,000 (as the same may hereafter be amended, restated, or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Note") pursuant to which the Lender has agreed to extend to the Borrower certain credit accommodations and executed a Security Agreement in favor of the Lender dated as of the date hereof (the "Security Agreement"). 

  

 B. The Pledgor is the owner free and clear of any liens or security interests of the Stock (defined below). 

  

 C. It is a condition precedent to the obligation of the Lender to extend credit accommodations pursuant to the terms of the Note that this Agreement be executed and delivered by the Pledgor. 

  

AGREEMENTS 

  

 FOR GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged by the Pledgor, it is agreed as follows: 

  

 1. _Grant of Security Interest_. As security for the payment and performance of the debt, liability and obligations that arise under or are evidenced by the Note and any documents or agreements executed in connection with the Note and any and all amendments, modifications, replacements thereof, (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Obligations"), upon the first Advance under the Note, the Pledgor does transfer, assign and grant to the Lender a security interest (the "Security Interest") in all of Pledgors right, title and interest in and to the following (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Collateral"), whether now owned or hereafter acquired or arising: 

   

 (a) all of Pledgors now existing and/or hereafter arising interest (collectively, the "Stock") in: ATS Medical France, SARL, a French corporation; ATS Medical GmbH, a German corporation; and ATS Medical Belgium SPRL, a Belgian corporation (collectively, the "Issuers"). All Stock now held by Pledgor is itemized on _Schedule 1(a)_ attached hereto; and 

   

 (b) any instruments representing the Stock and all income, distributions, dividends, cash, instruments and other property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for any or all of the Stock; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) all proceeds of any and all of the foregoing (including, without limitation, proceeds that constitute property of types described above). 

  

 2. _Possession and Delivery of Pledged Collateral_. The Pledgor shall deliver all instruments, if any, representing or evidencing the Collateral to the Lender to be held by the Lender pursuant hereto, which shall be in suitable form for transfer by delivery, or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender. The Lender shall have the right at any time to exchange instruments representing or evidencing Collateral for instruments of smaller or larger denominations. 

  

 3. _Voting Rights; Dividends; Etc_. 

   

 (a) Subject to Section 3(d) below, the Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise or refrain from exercising any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;  _provided, however,_ that the Pledgor shall not exercise or refrain from exercising any such right if such action could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the value of the Collateral or any material part thereof. 

   

 (b) Subject to Section 3(e) below, the Pledgor shall be entitled to receive, retain, or use in any manner not prohibited by this Agreement any and all dividends and other distributions other than stock dividends paid in respect of the Collateral. 

   

 (c) The Lender shall execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Pledgor all such proxies and other instruments as the Pledgor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling the Pledgor to exercise the voting and other rights that it is entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof and to receive the dividends and other distributions that it is authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof. 

   

 (d) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default (defined below), the Lender shall have the right in its sole discretion, 

   

 (i) to terminate all rights of the Pledgor to exercise or refrain from exercising the voting and other consensual rights that the Pledgor would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Lender who shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise or refrain from exercising such voting and other consensual rights, and 

   

 (ii) to cause any or all of the Collateral to be transferred of record into the name of the Lender or its nominee. 

   

The Pledgor irrevocably appoints the Lender as proxy, with full power of
substitution and revocation, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and
so long as such Event of 

   ##### 

  

    

Default continues, to exercise the Lenders rights to attend meetings, vote,
consent to and/or take any action respecting the Collateral or any issuer
thereof as fully as the Pledgor might do. This proxy remains effective so
long as any of the Obligations are unpaid. In addition, the Pledgor shall
execute and deliver all such other proxies and other instruments as may be
necessary or appropriate to give effect to the rights specified in this
Section 3(d). The Pledgor irrevocably agrees, upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default and so long as such Event of Default continues, to the extent the
Lender is incapable of exercising Pledgors rights to attend meetings, vote,
consent to and/or take any action respecting the collateral or any issuer
thereof as fully as the Pledgor might do, to exercise all such rights at the
Lenders direction in the Lenders sole discretion. 

   

 (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default: 

   

 (i) all rights of the Pledgor to receive the dividends and other distributions that the Pledgor would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Lender who shall thereupon have the sole right to receive and hold such dividends and other distributions as Collateral hereunder in accordance with Section 6 hereof, and 

   

 (ii) all dividends and other distributions that are received by the Pledgor contrary to the provisions of paragraph (i) of this Section 3(e) shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Lender, shall be segregated from other funds of the Pledgor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Lender as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). 

  

 4. _Pledgor s Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Pledgor represents, warrants, covenants and agrees: 

   

 (a) _Authorization_. Pledgor has full power, authority and authorization to execute, enter into, deliver and perform this Agreement. Except to the extent required under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction under which an issuer of Stock is organized or incorporated, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not: (i) require any consent or approval of any entity which has not been obtained; or (ii) violate any provision of any indenture, contract, agreement or instrument to which the Pledgor is a party or by which the Pledgor is bound. 

   

 (b) _With Respect to Collateral_. 

   

 (i) The Pledgor is the legal and beneficial owner of the Collateral free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance except for the security interest created by this Agreement. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral is not subject to any "blanket" security interests granted by the Pledgor other than in favor of the Lender. The Pledgor has not granted, and will not grant or permit to exist, any lien or security interests in all or any 

   ##### 

  

    

portion of the Collateral other than the Permitted Liens as defined in
the Security Agreement. 

   

 (ii) The grant of the security interest in the Collateral by the Pledgor pursuant to this Agreement, together with the filing of a UCC financing statement covering any of the Collateral which may constitute general intangibles, creates a valid and perfected first priority lien on and security interest in the Collateral subject to requirements of laws of any foreign jurisdiction under which an issuer of Stock is organized or incorporated. Pledgor shall defend the Collateral against all claims and demands of all and any other persons at any time claiming any interest therein adverse to the Lender. 

   

 (iii) The Pledgor agrees that the Pledgor will not (1) sell, assign (by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, any of the Collateral, or (2) create or permit to exist any lien, claim or encumbrance upon or with respect to any such Collateral (other than the lien in favor of the Lender and Permitted Liens (as defined in the Security Agreement)). 

   

 (iv) The Pledgor shall promptly pay when due all taxes and other charges levied or assessed upon or against any Collateral, and shall execute such writings and take such other actions with respect to the Collateral as the Lender may request. 

   

 (v) The Pledgor shall deliver to the Lender upon receipt all notices, reports and other writings received by the Pledgor as owner or holder of any Collateral. 

   

 (vi) No one except the Lender has control over any of the Stock, and the Pledgor has not entered into any agreement that gives anyone except the Lender control over any of the Stock. The Lender shall not permit anyone other than the Lender to have control over any of the Stock. The Pledgor shall not enter into any agreement that gives anyone except the Lender control over any of the Stock. In this Agreement, the term "control" has the meaning assigned to that term in the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted by Delaware (the "Code"). 

   

 (vii)The Pledgor shall not permit its interest in any of the Issuers to be less than 100% of the total equity interests in such Issuer at any time. 

   

 (d) _Actions and Proceedings_. There are no actions at law, suits in equity or any other proceedings before any governmental agency, commission, bureau, or other arbitration proceedings against or affecting the Pledgor that if adversely determined would adversely affect the Pledgors interest in the Collateral or would adversely affect the rights of the Pledgor to pledge and assign all or a part of the Collateral or the rights and security afforded the Lender hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) _Costs of Collection_. The Pledgor shall reimburse the Lender, upon demand, for: (i) all of the Lenders reasonable costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees and legal expenses, with interest thereon, incurred by the Lender in connection with the enforcement by the Lender during the term hereof or thereafter of any of the rights or remedies of the Lender hereunder, including without limitation, reasonable costs and expenses of collection in the Event of Default, whether or not suit is filed with respect thereto and whether such costs are paid or incurred, or to be paid or incurred, prior to or after entry of judgment; (ii) all taxes, levies, and other expenses relating to preserving the Collateral; and (iii) all costs of the Lender incurred in disposing of the Collateral. 

  

 5. _Event of Default_. It shall be an Event of Default under this Agreement upon the happening of any of the following: 

   

 (a) an Event of Default (as defined therein) occurs under the Note or any other document executed in connection with the Note; or 

   

 (b) the Pledgor shall fail to comply with or perform in any respect any of the terms, conditions or covenants of this Agreement or any other agreement of the Pledgor in favor of the Lender and such failure continues for 30 days after written notice from Lender; or 

   

 (c) any representation or warranty made by the Pledgor herein or in any document, instrument or certificate given in connection with this Agreement shall be false when made in any material respect. 

  

 6. _Remedies_. Upon an Event of Default and so long as such Event of Default continues, the Lender may declare all Obligations immediately due and payable, and may, at its option, without notice, do any one or more of the following: 

   

 (a) Either in person or by agent, with or without bringing any action or proceeding, or by a receiver to be appointed by a court, enforce and exercise all of the rights of the Pledgor and all of the rights of the Lender hereunder. 

   

 (b) Exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the Code in effect at that time (whether or not the Code then applies to the affected Collateral), and may also, without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange, brokers board or at any of the Lenders offices or elsewhere, for cash and upon such other terms as the Lender may reasonably believe are commercially reasonable. The Pledgor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days prior notice to the Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Lender shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Lender may adjourn any public or private sale from time to 

   ##### 

  

    

time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may,
without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so
adjourned. 

   

 (c) Exercise any of the remedies available to a secured party under the Code. 

   

 (d) Proceed immediately to exercise each and all of the powers, rights, and privileges reserved or granted to the Lender under this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Proceed to protect and enforce this Agreement by suits or proceedings or otherwise, and enforce any other legal or equitable remedy available to the Lender. 

  

 Any cash held by the Lender as Collateral and all cash proceeds received by the Lender in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral may, in the discretion of the Lender, be held by the Lender as collateral for, or then or at any time thereafter, or if the Pledgor requests, be applied in whole or in part by the Lender for its benefit against, all or any part of the Obligations. To the extent that such cash or such proceeds are to be applied against all or any part of such obligations, they shall be applied as follows: 

   

 _First_ : to the payment of the reasonable costs and expenses of such sale or other disposition, including the reasonable out of pocket expenses of the Lender and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed in connection therewith, and to the payment of all advances made by the Lender for the account of the Pledgor pursuant to this Agreement; 

   

 _Second_ : to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Lender, in connection with the administration and enforcement of this Agreement, to the extent they shall not have been previously reimbursed; 

   

 _Third_ : to the payment of any and all other Obligations; and 

   

 _Fourth_ : any surplus after such application shall be paid to the Pledgor, or as otherwise required by law or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. 

  

 7. _Waiver of Certain Claims_. The Pledgor acknowledges that because of present or future circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as from time to time amended (the "Securities Laws") with respect to any disposition of the Collateral permitted hereunder. The Pledgor understands that compliance with the Securities Laws may very strictly limit the course of conduct of the Lender if the Lender were to attempt to dispose of all or any portion of the Collateral and may also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of the Collateral or any portion thereof may dispose of the same. There may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Lender in any attempt to dispose of all or any portion of the Collateral under the applicable Blue Sky or other securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. The Lender may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire such Collateral for such purchasers own account for investment only and not to engage in a distribution or resale thereof. The Pledgor agrees that the Lender shall not incur 

   ##### 

  

 

any liability as a result of the sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof
at any private sale of stock, if a private sale is effected by the Lender in
a manner that the Lender reasonably believes is in all other respects
commercially reasonable (within the meaning of the Code). The Pledgor hereby
waives any claims against the Lender arising by reason of the fact that the
price at which the Collateral may have been sold at such sale was less than
the price that might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the
aggregate amount of the Obligations, even if the Lender shall accept the
first offer received and does not offer any portion of the Collateral to more
than one possible purchaser. The Pledgor further agrees that the Lender has no
obligation to delay the sale of any Collateral for the period of time
necessary to permit the issuer of such Collateral to qualify or register such
Collateral for public sale under the Securities Laws, applicable Blue Sky
laws and other applicable state and/or federal securities laws, even if
such issuer would agree to do so, or to delay the sale of any Collateral for
any other or no reason. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
provisions of this Section 7 would apply if, for example, the Lender were to
place all or any portion of the Collateral for private placement by an
investment banking firm, or if such investment banking firm purchased all or
any portion of the Collateral for its own account, or if the Lender placed
all or any portion of the Collateral privately with a purchaser or
purchasers. 

   

 8. _Authorization to File Financing Statements; Further Assurances_. Pledgor hereby authorizes the filing of such financing statements as the Lender may deem necessary or useful to be filed in order to perfect the Security Interest. In addition, the Pledgor shall execute and deliver to the Lender, promptly and at the Pledgors expense, such other documents and assurances, and take such further action as the Lender may reasonably request, in order to effectively carry out the intent and purpose of this Agreement, and to establish and protect the rights, interests and remedies of the Lender hereunder. The Pledgor agrees that the Lender is authorized, at its option, to file a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement as a financing statement and shall be sufficient as a financing statement under the Code and to file financing statements or amendments thereto without the signature of the Pledgor and, if a signature is required by law, then Pledgor appoints the Lender as the Pledgors attorney-in-fact to execute any such financing statements. 

  

 9. _Cumulative Remedies_. All of the Lenders rights and remedies herein are cumulative and in addition to any rights or remedies available at law or in equity including the Code, and may be exercised concurrently or separately. 

  

 10. _Indemnification_. The Pledgor shall and does hereby agree to indemnify against and to hold the Lender harmless of and from any and all liability, loss or damage which it may or might incur under or by reason of this Agreement and of and from any and all claims and demands whatsoever which may be asserted against it by reason of any alleged obligations or undertakings on its part to perform or discharge any of the terms, covenants or agreements of this Agreement, excepting the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender. The Lender shall notify Pledgor of any event requiring indemnification within ten days following the Lenders receipt of notice of commencement of any action or proceeding, or the Lenders obtaining knowledge of the occurrence of any other event, giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. The Pledgor will be entitled (but not obligated) to assume the defense or settlement of any such action or proceeding or to participate in any negotiations to settle or otherwise resolve any claim using counsel of its choice. If the Pledgor elects to assume 

   ##### 

  

 

the defense or settlement of any such action or proceeding, the Lender (and
its counsel) may continue to participate at its own expense in such action or
proceeding. If the Lender incurs any such liability, or if the Lender is
required to defend against any such claims or demands or if a judgment is
entered against the Lender, then the amount thereof, including costs,
expenses, and reasonable attorneys fees, shall bear interest thereon at the
highest rate then in effect under the Note, shall be secured hereby, and the
Pledgor shall reimburse the Lender for the same immediately upon demand, and
upon the failure of the Pledgor so to do, the Lender may declare
all Obligations immediately due and payable. 

   

 11. _Attorney in Fact_. The Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints the Lender and its successors and assigns as the Pledgors agent and attorney-in-fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to exercise any rights or remedies with respect to the Collateral or to receive, endorse and collect all instruments made payable to the Pledgor representing any dividend or other distribution in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof to the extent expressly provided herein and to give full discharge for the same. This appointment shall become immediately effective upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and shall continue for the continuance thereof. 

  

 12. _Lender s Duties_. The powers conferred on the Lender hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for monies and for other properties actually received by it hereunder, the Lender shall have no duty as to any Collateral, as to ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not the Lender has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The Lender shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Lender accords its own property of like kind. 

  

 13. _Continuing Rights_. The rights and powers of the Lender or receiver hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect until all Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full. 

  

 14. _Books and Records_. The Pledgor will permit the Lender and its representatives to examine the Pledgors books and records (including data processing records and systems) with respect to the Collateral and make copies thereof at any time and from time to time, and the Pledgor will furnish such information reports to the Lender and its representatives regarding the Collateral as the Lender and its representatives may from time to time request. The Lender shall have the authority, at any time, to require the Pledgor to place upon the Pledgors books and records relating to the Collateral and other rights to payment covered by the security interest created in this Agreement a notation stating that any such Collateral and other rights of payment are subject to a security interest in favor of the Lender. 

   ##### 

  

  

 15. _Assigns_. This Agreement and each and every covenant, agreement and provision hereof shall be binding upon the Pledgor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Lender and its successors and assigns. 

  

 16. _Governing Law_. This Agreement is executed pursuant to and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota, except to the extent that the validity or perfection of the security interest granted hereunder, or the remedies provided hereunder, in respect of the Collateral are mandatorily governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of Minnesota. 

  

 17. _Severability_. It is the intent of this Agreement to confer to the Lender the rights and benefits hereunder to the full extent allowable by law including all rights available under the Code. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provisions hereof shall not render any other provision or provisions herein contained unenforceable or invalid. Any provisions found to be unenforceable shall be severable from this Agreement. 

  

 18. _Notices_. Any notices and other communications permitted or required by the provisions of this Agreement (except for telephonic notice expressly permitted) shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been properly given or served by depositing the same with the United States Postal Service, or any official successor thereto, designated as Registered or Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, bearing adequate postage, or delivery by reputable private carrier such as Federal Express, Airborne, DHL or similar overnight delivery service, and addressed as hereinafter provided. Each such notice shall be effective upon being deposited as aforesaid. The time period within which a response to any such notice must be given, however, shall commence to run from the date of receipt of the notice by the addressee thereof. Rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver because of changed address of which no notice was given shall be deemed to be receipt of the notice sent. Each notice shall be addressed to the address of the recipient as set forth on the signature page to this Agreement. By giving to the other party hereto at least ten (10) days notice thereof, either party hereto shall have the right from time to time and at any time during the term of this Agreement to change its address and shall have the right to specify as its address any other address within the United States of America. 

  

 19. _Captions and Headings_. The captions and headings of the various sections of this Agreement are for convenience only and are not to be construed as confining or limiting in any way the scope or intent of the provisions hereof. Whenever the context requires or permits, the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall include the singular and the masculine, feminine and neuter shall be freely interchangeable. 

  

 20. _Marshalling; Payments Set Aside_. The Lender shall be under no obligation to marshall any assets in favor of the Pledgor or any other person or entity or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any such Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Lender or any other person or entity upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Pledgor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

Form of Non Competition Agreement 

    ##### 

 

      

NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into by and between Astrid M. Berthe ("Individual") and Medtronic, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Parent"), as of April 28, 2010, and shall become effective as of the Effective Date (as defined below). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent, ATS Medical, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company"), and Pilgrim Merger Corporation, a Minnesota corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), propose to enter, or have entered, into an Agreement and Plan of Merger on or about April 28, 2010 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, on the Effective Date, Parent will acquire the capital stock and business (including goodwill, trade secrets, and other confidential or proprietary business information) of the Company by the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"); 

  

 WHEREAS, Individual is an employee of the Company and also owns common stock, options, restricted stock units and/or warrants to purchase common stock, of the Company, which in the Merger will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in the Merger Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent and the Company have agreed that Parents obligation to execute the Merger Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated thereby is subject to the condition, among others, that Individual shall have entered into this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, Individual desires to induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated thereby and acknowledges that this Agreement is ancillary to the Merger Agreement, and it is a condition to Parents execution or consummation of the Merger Agreement that Individual enter into this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, Individual and Parent mutually desire that the entire goodwill of the Company be transferred to Parent as part of the Merger and acknowledge that Parents failure to receive the entire goodwill contemplated by the Merger would have the effect of reducing the value of the Company to Parent; and 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and to induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the Merger, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 (c) directly or indirectly, solicit or attempt to solicit (on Individuals own behalf or on behalf of any other Person) any employee of the Company, or any subsidiary of Company, or their respective successors or assigns, to leave his or her employment with the Company, or any subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns, including, without limitation, any Parent Entity that is a successor to the business of the Company; __provided__ , __however__ _,_ that that the foregoing shall not prohibit the soliciting of any employee (i) who has not been employed by the Company or any Parent Entity during the preceding six months, (ii) whose employment was

Company or any Parent Entity; or 

   

 (d) directly or indirectly solicit, attempt to solicit, or interfere, or attempt to interfere, with the Companys relationship (or any Parent Entity that is a successor to the business of the Company) with the Companys existing customers or potential customers as of the Closing, on behalf of Individual or any other person or entity engaged in a Competing Business, _provided however_ that the foregoing shall not prohibit Individual from directly or indirectly soliciting, or attempting to solicit, any of the Companys or any Parent Entitys customers or potential customers for any purpose which is not a Competing Business. 

  

 3. _Geographic Scope_. Individual acknowledges that the each of the Company and the Parent Entities operates throughout the world and that the market for the Companys products is worldwide.

 4. _COBRA_. Subject to Individuals compliance with this Agreement, Parent agrees to cause the Company to pay Individual a monthly amount, in cash, equal to $1,800, to cover the cost of continuation of health insurance coverage insurance for Individual and Individuals spouse and/or other eligible dependents from the date Individual ceases to be employed by any of the Parent Entities until one year after the date Individual ceases to be employed by the any of the Parent Entities. 

  

 5. _Confidential Information_. 

   

 (a) _Generally_. Individual recognizes by reason of Individuals position and ownership stake in the Company, Individual has acquired Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) concerning the operation of the Company, the use or disclosure of which would cause any of the Parent Entities substantial loss and damage which could not be readily calculated and for which no remedy at law would be adequate. Accordingly, Individual agrees that Individual will not (directly or indirectly) at any time: 

   

 (i) knowingly use any Confidential Information that Individual may learn or has learned by reason of Individuals ownership of or employment with the Company, other than in good faith and only if necessary for the exclusive purposes of carrying out Individuals duties to the Parent Entities (if any). 

   

 (ii) disclose any such Confidential Information to any person, except (A) with the prior consent of Parent, or (B) after using reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of such Confidential Information, for the exclusive purpose of defending any claim with respect to Individuals obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Definition_. As used herein, " _Confidential Information_ " means any and all information of whatever type (including, without limitation, data, results, technology and all other information) of or relating to the Company, including, without limitation, 

   ##### 

  

    

information relating to (i) the development, research, testing,
quality assurance, manufacturing, production, regulatory and marketing
activities of the Company, (ii) the products and services of the Company,
(iii) financial information and data regarding the Company, (iv) pre-
clinical, patient and clinical trials conducted or paid for by or on behalf
of the Company, (v) the costs, sources of supply and strategic plans of
the Company, (vi) the identity and special needs of the customers of the
Company, (vii) patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property of the
Company, and (viii) people and organizations with whom the Company has
business relationships and the substance of those relationships. Confidential
Information also includes comparable information relating to third parties to
the extent that the Company has a legal duty to keep such
information confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential
Information shall not include any information that Individual demonstrates
(A) is or becomes generally known or available publicly, other than as a
result of disclosure by Individual which is not permitted as described in
Section 5(a) hereof, or (B) the Company (or the third party other than
Parent, as the case may be) intentionally makes public. 

   

 (c) _Confirmation_. Individual confirms that all Confidential Information is the exclusive property of the Parent Entities following the Closing. All business records, papers, documents and electronic materials kept or made by Individual relating to the business of the Company which comprise Confidential Information shall be and remain the property of the Parent Entities following the Closing. Upon the request of the Parent Entities at any time after the Closing, Individual shall promptly deliver to the Parent Entities, and shall retain no copies of, any written or electronic materials, records and documents made by Individual or coming into his possession concerning the business or affairs of the Company and which comprise Confidential Information. 

   

 (d) _Confidentiality of Terms_. Individual shall keep the terms of this Agreement strictly confidential, other than as may be required by law. 

  

 6. _Injunctive Relief_. In addition to any other relief or remedies afforded by law or in equity, if Individual breaches this Agreement, Individual agrees that Parent shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, and that the prevailing party in any such action shall be entitled to seek reasonable attorneys fees to the extent permitted by law. Individual recognizes that products and inventions generated by Individual while an employee of the Company or the Parent Entities or in connection with consulting services rendered by Individual to the Company or the Parent Entities are the property of the Company or the Parent Entities, respectively, the value of which would be adversely affected by Individuals violation of this Agreement, and Individual hereby admits that irreparable damage will result to the Company and Parent if Individual violates or threatens to violate the terms of this Agreement. This Section 6 shall not preclude the granting of any other appropriate relief including, without limitation, money damages against Individual for breach of this Agreement. 

  

 7. _Severability_. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then (i) the remaining terms and provisions hereof shall be unimpaired, and (ii) the invalid or unenforceable term or provision shall be deemed replaced by a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8. _Authority_. Individual represents and warrants to Parent as follows: (a) Individual has full capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform Individuals obligations hereunder; (b) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Individual and constitutes a legal, valid, and binding agreement of Individual, enforceable against Individual in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium, and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles; and (c) Individual has a substantial interest in the Company as a significant Individual of the Company. 

  

 9. _Complete Agreement; Effectiveness_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties, whether written or oral, relating hereto. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this Agreement, the effectiveness of this Agreement is conditioned upon and subject to the occurrence of the Merger; and this Agreement shall be null and void if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII thereof or is otherwise not consummated as substantially contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

  

 10. _Waiver, Discharge, Amendment, Etc_. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part thereof or the right of the party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. Any amendment to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto. This Agreement shall not be superseded by any future agreement entered into between Individual and Parent unless such future agreement specifically refers to this Agreement by date and states specifically by section reference the portions of this Agreement that such future agreement is intended to supersede. 

  

 11. _Titles and Headings; Construction_. The titles and headings to sections herein are inserted for the convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Individual and Parent acknowledge that Individual and Parent have jointly participated in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and the parties agree that this Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or other rule requiring construction hereof against the party causing this Agreement to be drafted. 

  

 12. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, this Agreement may not be assigned without the express written consent of all parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may assign this Agreement to a Sub of Parent or to such business organization that shall succeed to the business of Parent or of such Sub to which this Agreement relates. 

  

 13. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota, including all matters of construction, validity, performance, and enforcement, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws. The parties hereby agree and consent to be subject to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court in Hennepin County, Minnesota, with respect to all actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement (although each party reserves the right to bring such action or 

   ##### 

  

 

proceedings in any other jurisdiction to which the other party is subject, to
the extent permitted by law).

   

 14. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.
