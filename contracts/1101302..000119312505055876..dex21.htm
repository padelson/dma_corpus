by and among Entegris, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Entegris"), Mykrolis
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Mykrolis"), and Eagle DE, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Entegris ("Eagle
Delaware").



RECITALS



A. The Board of Directors of each of Entegris, Eagle Delaware and Mykrolis
deems it advisable and in the best interests of the respective corporation
and its shareholders that Entegris and Mykrolis combine in a merger of equals
to advance the long-term business interests of Entegris and Mykrolis and each
has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Entegris has
determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of Entegris and its
shareholders to reincorporate Entegris as a Delaware corporation and the Board
of Directors of Eagle Delaware has determined that it is advisable and in the
best interests of Eagle Delaware to merge with Entegris in order to effect the
reincorporation of Entegris as a Delaware corporation.



B. The strategic combination of Entegris and Mykrolis shall be effected
by the terms of this Agreement through a transaction in which Entegris will
first reincorporate in the State of Delaware through a merger (the
"Reincorporation Merger") of Entegris with and into Eagle Delaware, whereby
the shareholders of Entegris will become stockholders of Eagle Delaware, and,
following the Reincorporation Merger, Mykrolis will merge with and into Eagle
Delaware, and the stockholders of Mykrolis will become stockholders of Eagle
Delaware (the "Merger"). 



C. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Reincorporation
Merger be treated as a reincorporation under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this
Agreement constitute a plan of reorganization.



D. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
that this Agreement constitute a plan of reorganization.



E. The Board of Directors of each of Entegris, Eagle Delaware and Mykrolis has
determined to recommend to its shareholders and stockholders,
respectively, the approval and adoption of this Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows
(terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in
Section 10.08):



ARTICLE 0 



_THE REINCORPORATION MERGER_  



0.01. _The Reincorporation Merger_. Simultaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, Entegris and Eagle Delaware have entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the "Reincorporation Plan of Merger") in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ providing for the Reincorporation Merger (as defined in the
Reincorporation Plan of Merger). Entegris and Eagle Delaware will not amend or
otherwise modify the Reincorporation Plan of Merger without the prior written
consent of Mykrolis. Immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger,
Entegris shall be merged with and into Eagle Delaware in accordance with the
Reincorporation Plan of Merger. From and after the effective time of the
Reincorporation Merger (the "Reincorporation Merger Effective Time"), the
separate existence of Entegris shall terminate and Eagle Delaware shall
continue in existence as the surviving corporation of the Reincorporation
Merger (the "Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation"). The
Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware and shall be named "Entegris, Inc." All references in
this    Agreement to Entegris (other than in this Article 0 with respect to the
consummation of the Reincorporation Merger) shall be deemed to refer, from and
after the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time, to Eagle Delaware as the
surviving corporation of the Reincorporation Merger.



0.02. _Effects of the Reincorporation Merger._ The conversion of common stock
of Entegris, par value $.01 per share ("Entegris Common Stock") into common
stock of Eagle Delaware, par value $.01 per share ("Eagle Delaware Common
Stock"), pursuant to the Reincorporation Merger, the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Reincorporation Merger
Surviving Corporation, the manner in which options and restricted stock units
for Entegris Common Stock shall become options and restricted stock units for
Eagle Delaware Common Stock following the Reincorporation Merger, the
treatment of stock certificates previously representing Entegris Common Stock
following the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time and the other effects of
the Reincorporation Merger shall be as set forth in the Reincorporation Plan
of Merger.



0.03. _Qualification in Minnesota_. Prior to the Reincorporation Merger
Effective Time, Eagle Delaware shall take all action necessary to qualify to
do business as a foreign corporation in the State of Minnesota.



0.04. _Coordination of Reincorporation Merger and Merger_. Each of Entegris,
Eagle Delaware and Mykrolis understand and agree that the Reincorporation
Merger is being consummated only to facilitate the completion of the Merger.
The Reincorporation Merger shall not be consummated unless all conditions to
the Merger have been satisfied or waived and Eagle Delaware and Mykrolis are
prepared to consummate the Merger immediately after the Reincorporation Merger
Effective Time.



ARTICLE I



_THE MERGER_



1.01. _Merger._ At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02) and
immediately following the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time, and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Corporation Law"), Mykrolis shall be
merged with and into Eagle Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of
Mykrolis shall thereupon cease. Eagle Delaware shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the Delaware Corporation
Law. The Merger shall have the other effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the Delaware Corporation Law.



1.02.  _Effective Time of the Merger_. The Merger shall become effective (the
"Effective Time") upon the filing of a certificate of merger (the "Certificate
of Merger") with the Delaware Secretary of State in such form as is required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the Delaware
Corporation Law and the terms of this Agreement or at such later date or time
as Eagle Delaware and Mykrolis agree and specify in the Certificate
of Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made immediately
following the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time and as soon as
practicable, but no more than three business days (unless Entegris and
Mykrolis shall otherwise agree) following the later of (a) the receipt of the
respective votes of the shareholders of Entegris and the stockholders of
Mykrolis as contemplated by Section 6.04, and (b) the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent waivable under Article VII) of all conditions to the
consummation of the Merger set forth in Article VII (other than the delivery
of an officers certificate required by Sections 7.02(a), 7.02(b) and 7.02(c)
and Sections 7.03(a), 7.03(b) and 7.03(c) and the delivery of the
legal opinions required by Sections 7.02(d) and 7.03(d) so long as such
conditions are satisfied or waived at the Closing (as defined in Section
3.01)).



1.03. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Eagle Delaware, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The parties agree that,
and agree to take all action in order that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Eagle  



 

2  Delaware shall be in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibits B_ and _C_ ,
respectively, unless and to the extent the parties agree to changes
therein (in which case the parties agree to cause the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Eagle Delaware to be in such forms, with such
changes as are agreed upon by the parties, immediately prior to the Effective
Time); _provided_ ,  _however_ , if any provision of such Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws (i) is required to be submitted separately to
shareholders for approval at the time of their approval of the Merger and (ii)
does not receive the approval of such shareholders, then the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Eagle Delaware as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall not include any such provision.



1.04. _Board of Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth in Section
8.04(b), each to hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and
qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal. The
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth in Section
8.04(b) until their respective successors are appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation, or removal.



ARTICLE II



_CONVERSION OF SHARES_



2.01. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:



(a) Each share of Common Stock of Mykrolis, par value $.01 per share the
"Mykrolis Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time (other than shares of Mykrolis Common Stock held of record by
Eagle Delaware) shall be converted into the right to receive 1.39 fully paid
and nonassessable shares (the "Merger Consideration") of Eagle Delaware Common
Stock, subject to Section 2.05.



(b) Each share of Eagle Delaware Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and each
certificate formerly representing such shares of Eagle Delaware Common Stock
(including certificates formerly representing shares of Entegris Common Stock
that have not been surrendered in connection with the Reincorporation Merger
for certificates representing shares of Eagle Delaware Common Stock) shall
evidence ownership and represent the same number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation (referred to herein as "Eagle Delaware Common
Stock"). 



2.02. _Effect of Conversion on Shares of Mykrolis Common Stock_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, all shares of Mykrolis Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will cease to exist and
will cease to be outstanding as a result of their conversion pursuant to
Section 2.01, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Mykrolis Common Stock
(a "Certificate") will thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Mykrolis Common Stock, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Eagle Delaware Common
Stock to be issued in consideration therefor pursuant to Section 2.05, and
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.06(d), in
each case in accordance with this Article II, upon surrender of such
Certificate.



2.03. _Cancelation of Shares of Mykrolis Common Stock Held by Eagle Delaware
and Subsidiaries_. At the Effective Time, each share of Mykrolis Common Stock
held of record by Eagle Delaware immediately prior to the Effective Time will,
by virtue of the Merger, cease to exist and cease to be outstanding and will
be canceled and no stock of Eagle Delaware or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.



2.04. _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Mykrolis Common Stock granted under any employee stock
option or compensation plan of, or other arrangement with, Mykrolis shall be
assumed by Eagle Delaware as the Surviving Corporation in accordance with
Section 6.09.



 

3 2.05. _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Eagle Delaware Common
Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Eagle Delaware
Common Stock to which a holder of Mykrolis Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled at the Effective Time shall be aggregated. If a fractional share
would otherwise result from this aggregation, the stockholder shall be
entitled upon the surrender of the stockholders Certificate(s) to receive
from Eagle Delaware an amount in cash in lieu of the fractional share, based
on the per-share closing sale price of Entegris Common Stock or Eagle
Delaware Common Stock, as the case may be, on the NASDAQ National Market
("NASDAQ") on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. Eagle
Delaware will make available to the Exchange Agent the cash necessary to pay
for fractional shares.



2.06.  _Exchange of Certificates._



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Eagle Delaware shall authorize Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., or such other firm as is reasonably acceptable to Mykrolis, to
serve as exchange agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent") pursuant to an
agreement reasonably acceptable to Mykrolis. At or immediately following the
Effective Time, Eagle Delaware shall cause to be deposited in trust with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Mykrolis Common Stock,
certificates representing the number of whole shares of Eagle Delaware Common
Stock to which the holders of Mykrolis Common Stock are entitled under this
Article II, and shall agree in writing with the Exchange Agent to deposit in
trust with the Exchange Agent as needed cash sufficient to pay for fractional
shares in accordance with Section 2.05 (such cash amounts and certificates are
referred to herein collectively as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions received from Eagle Delaware,
deliver the number of shares of Eagle Delaware Common Stock and pay the
amounts of cash provided for in Sections 2.01 and 2.05 out of the Exchange
Fund. Additional amounts of cash, if any, needed from time to time by the
Exchange Agent to make payments for fractional shares shall be provided by
Eagle Delaware and shall become part of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
may not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement,
or as otherwise agreed by Mykrolis and Eagle Delaware before the Effective
Time. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund
as directed by Eagle Delaware. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments will be paid to Eagle Delaware.

 



(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail and otherwise make available to each record holder (other than Eagle
Delaware or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Eagle Delaware)
who, as of the Effective Time, was a holder of a Certificate a letter
of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificate for payment therefor and conversion thereof. Delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificate to the Exchange Agent and the letter of
transmittal shall so reflect.



(c) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate representing shares
of Mykrolis Common Stock, together with the letter of transmittal duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) one or more certificates as requested by the holder
(properly issued, executed, and countersigned, as appropriate) representing
the number of whole shares of Eagle Delaware Common Stock to which that
holder of Mykrolis Common Stock is entitled pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.01, and (ii) as to any fractional share, a check representing the
cash consideration to which the holder is entitled under Section 2.05, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any cash payable for fractional shares upon surrender of a
Certificate. Eagle Delaware shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Eagle Delaware
Common Stock if the certificate is issued in the name of the person in whose
name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Eagle Delaware shall not pay any transfer or
other tax if payment of any such tax by Eagle Delaware would cause the Merger
to fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Code. If any portion
of the applicable Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to this
Article II upon exchange of a Certificate is to be issued or paid to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of issuance and payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting the exchange shall pay
in advance any  



 

4  transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of the applicable
Merger Consideration to such other person, or establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that the tax has been paid or that no tax is
applicable.



(d) From the Effective Time until surrender in accordance with this Section
2.06, each Certificate (other than any Certificates representing shares held
of record by Eagle Delaware) shall be deemed, for all corporate purposes
other than the payment of dividends or other distributions, to evidence the
ownership of the applicable Merger Consideration into which those shares of
Mykrolis Common Stock shall have been converted. No dividends or other
distributions that are otherwise payable with respect to the applicable
Merger Consideration will be paid to persons entitled to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration until they surrender their Certificates.
Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat, and similar
laws, promptly after surrender of a Certificate, there shall be paid to the
person in whose name the applicable Merger Consideration is issued any
dividends or other distributions on such applicable Merger Consideration that
shall have a record date on or after the Effective Time and before surrender,
_provided_ _that_ if the payment date for any dividend or other distribution
is after the date of surrender, the payment shall be made on the payment
date. Persons entitled to receive dividends or other distributions shall not
be entitled to receive interest on them. Eagle Delaware shall make available
to the Exchange Agent from time to time the cash necessary to make payments
of dividends or other distributions on Eagle Delaware Common Stock and any
such cash shall become part of the Exchange Fund.



(e) In the case of any lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate, the holder
thereof may be required, as a condition precedent to the delivery to the
holder of the consideration described in Section 2.01 and 2.05, to deliver to
Eagle Delaware a written indemnity agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Eagle Delaware and, if reasonably deemed advisable by
Eagle Delaware, a bond in such reasonable sum as Eagle Delaware may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Mykrolis with respect to the Certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.



(f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation or Mykrolis of the shares of
Mykrolis Common Stock that were outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the consideration described in Sections 2.01 and 2.05. After the Effective
Time, Eagle Delaware shall cause the shares of Mykrolis Common Stock to
be delisted from New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE").



(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Mykrolis one year after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Eagle Delaware, upon demand, and any holder who has not complied with this
Section 2.06 shall thereafter look only to Eagle Delaware, and (subject to
abandoned property, escheat, or similar laws) only as a general creditor
thereof, for issuance of the applicable Merger Consideration and other
consideration to which the holder is entitled hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the Exchange
Agent, Mykrolis, or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a holder of
shares of Mykrolis Common Stock for any amount required to be paid to a
public official under any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar
law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years
after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any shares of Eagle Delaware Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Eagle Delaware Common Stock or any dividends or other distributions
with respect to Eagle Delaware Common Stock issuable in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Body, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Eagle Delaware, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



2.07. _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The applicable Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, exchange,
subdivision, combination of, or other similar change in Entegris Common Stock,
Eagle Delaware Common Stock or Mykrolis Common Stock after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time to provide to holders of Mykrolis
Common Stock the same economic effect and percentage ownership of Eagle
Delaware Common  



 

5  Stock as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such change in Entegris
Common Stock, Eagle Delaware Common Stock or Mykrolis Common Stock; 
_provided_ _that_ the foregoing shall not permit Mykrolis or Entegris to take
any action that is prohibited under this Agreement.



2.08. _Withholding Rights._ The Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such
amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payments under the Code, or any provisions of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such amounts withheld
shall be treated for purpose of this Agreement as having been paid to such
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.



ARTICLE III



_CLOSING_



3.01. _Generally_. Subject to the provisions of Article VII, the closing (the
"Closing") of the transactions contemplated hereby shall occur at 10:00 a.m.,
Minneapolis, Minnesota time, two (2) business days following the special

ARTICLE IV



_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_



As used with respect to Mykrolis or Entegris, as the case may be, the term
"Material Adverse Effect" means (i) any change or effect, individually or in
the aggregate, that has or is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations, results of operations, properties
or financial condition of the party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
other than changes or effects (A) caused by changes in general economic or
securities markets conditions, (B) that affect the business in which such
party and its Subsidiaries operate in general and which do not have a
materially disproportionate effect on such party and its Subsidiaries, (C)
resulting from acts of terrorism or war (whether or not declared), (D)
resulting from the announcement or proposed consummation of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, (E) resulting from compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, or (F) in the market price or trading
volume of the partys common stock, or (ii) a material impairment on the
ability of the party and its Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



4.01. _Representations and Warranties of Mykrolis_. Except as otherwise set
forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Mykrolis to Entegris
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Mykrolis Disclosure
Schedule"), Mykrolis represents and warrants to Entegris and Eagle Delaware
as follows:



(a) _Organization, Standing, Qualification._ Mykrolis is a corporation and
each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited liability company (as
identified in the Mykrolis Disclosure Schedule) duly organized, validly
existing, and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization (as identified in the Mykrolis Disclosure Schedule) and has the
requisite corporate or limited liability company, as applicable, power and
authority to own, lease, and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as it is now  



 

6  being conducted. Each of Mykrolis and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation or limited liability company to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, operated, or leased by it, or the nature of its
business, makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified, licensed, or in good standing
would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis.
Complete and correct copies of the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws or similar charter or organizational documents of Mykrolis and
each of its Subsidiaries have been made available to Entegris.



(b) _Capitalization._ The authorized capital stock of Mykrolis consists solely
of the following: (i) 250,000,000 shares of Mykrolis Common Stock, of which,
as of February 1, 2005, 41,961,602 shares were issued and outstanding; and
(ii) 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $.01 par value per share (the
"Mykrolis Preferred Stock"), of which, as of the date of this Agreement, none
is issued and outstanding. No shares of Mykrolis Common Stock are held in the
treasury of Mykrolis. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of Mykrolis and each of its corporate Subsidiaries, and all of
the limited liability company interests of each of its limited liability
company Subsidiaries, have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully
paid and nonassessable (in the case of such capital stock), and were not
granted in violation of any statutory preemptive rights. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
rights, calls, or other agreements or commitments of any character pursuant to
which Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries is or may become obligated to
issue, sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, or purchase, redeem, or
otherwise acquire, any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries, and there are no
outstanding securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such capital
stock or other equity interests, except for (i) options to purchase up to an
aggregate of 6,809,003 shares of Mykrolis Common Stock at the exercise prices
set forth in the Mykrolis Disclosure Schedule, (ii) the Common Stock Rights
Agreement, dated as of November 29, 2001, between Mykrolis and Equiserve Trust
Company, N.A., as Rights Agent, as amended (the "Mykrolis Rights Agreement")
pursuant to which each outstanding share of Mykrolis Common Stock has
attached to it certain rights (the "Mykrolis Rights") to purchase one share of
Mykrolis Common Stock, at a purchase price of $130 per share (subject to
adjustment), and (iii) rights of participants to purchase shares of Mykrolis
Common Stock pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of Mykrolis (the
"Mykrolis Employee Stock Purchase Plan"). There are no preemptive rights,
rights of first refusal, rights of first offer, or any similar rights granted
by Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the securities of
Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights, or performance shares
outstanding with respect to Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries or similar
agreements or commitments obligating Mykrolis or any Subsidiary of Mykrolis to
make cash payments pursuant to any stock based or stock related plan
based upon the market price performance of Mykrolis Common Stock. Mykrolis
owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock or limited liability company interests of every class of each of
its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens, security interests, pledges,
charges, and other encumbrances. The Mykrolis Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and correct list of each corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, or other business association in which Mykrolis
has any direct or indirect equity ownership interest, including the nature of
the equity interest held by Mykrolis therein. There are no voting trusts or
agreements or arrangements to which Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or of which Mykrolis otherwise has knowledge with respect to the voting
of its capital stock.



(c) _Authorization and Execution._



 

(i) Mykrolis has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and, subject to approval by Mykrolis stockholders at the special
meeting of stockholders referred to in Section 4.01(c)(ii), to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery, and performance of
this Agreement by Mykrolis have been duly authorized by the Board of
Directors of Mykrolis, and no further corporate action of Mykrolis, other than
the approval of its stockholders and the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware is necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Mykrolis and, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Entegris and  



 

7  Eagle Delaware set forth in Section 4.02(c), constitutes the legal, valid,
and binding obligation of Mykrolis, enforceable against Mykrolis in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability,
to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought
in a court of law or equity).



(ii) Mykrolis Board of Directors has at a meeting duly called and held: (A)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Mykrolis
stockholders; (B) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (C) resolved to recommend approval of this Agreement and
the Merger by its stockholders (the "Mykrolis Voting Proposal"). No other
corporate proceedings on the part of Mykrolis are necessary to authorize or
approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for the approval of the Mykrolis Voting Proposal by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the
Mykrolis Common Stock entitled to vote at a meeting (the "Mykrolis
Shareholders Meeting") of the stockholders of Mykrolis convened to consider
and vote upon the Mykrolis Voting Proposal (the "Requisite Mykrolis
Shareholder Approval"). No person is entitled to appraisal or dissenters
rights under the Delaware Corporation Law as a result of this Agreement or
the Merger.



(d) _No Conflicts._ Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Mykrolis nor the consummation by Mykrolis of the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with their terms, will (i) conflict with or result in a
breach of the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Articles of
Organization, operating agreement, or similar charter or organizational
documents, as currently in effect, of Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries;
(ii) require any filing with, or consent or approval of, any governmental
authority having jurisdiction over any of the business or assets of Mykrolis
or any of its Subsidiaries, except for (A) the requirements under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"), (b) filings
as may be required under foreign antitrust or competition Laws, (C) the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, and (D)
the filing of the Joint Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 4.01(f)
hereof) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in accordance with
the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"); (iii) violate any statute, law, ordinance, rule, or
regulation applicable to Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries or any
injunction, judgment, order, writ, or decree to which Mykrolis or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets has been specifically
identified as subject; or (iv) result in a breach of, or constitute a default
or an event that, with or without the passage of time or the giving of notice,
or both, would constitute a default, give rise to a right of termination,
cancelation, or acceleration, create any entitlement of any third party to any
material payment or benefit, require notice to or the consent of any third
party, or result in the creation of any Lien on the assets of Mykrolis or any
of its Subsidiaries under, any Mykrolis Material Contract (as defined in
Section 4.01(i)), except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), where
the violation, breach, default, termination, cancelation, acceleration,
payment, benefit, or Lien, or the failure to make such filing or obtain such
consent or approval would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Mykrolis.



(e) _SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities._



(i) Mykrolis has made available to Entegris, in the form filed with the SEC,
its (A) Annual Report on Form 10-K for each of its fiscal years ended December
31, 2002 through December 31, 2004, (B) all proxy statements relating to
Mykrolis meetings of shareholders (whether annual or special) held since
January 1, 2002, and (C) all other reports, registration statements, and other
filings (including amendments to previously filed documents) filed by Mykrolis
with the SEC since January 1, 2002 (all such reports, proxy statements,
registration statements, and filings, other than the Joint Proxy Statement
(as defined in Section 4.01(f)), being herein collectively called the
"Mykrolis SEC Reports" and individually called a "Mykrolis SEC Report").
Taking into account any amendments and supplements filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, no Mykrolis SEC Report, as of its filing date, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the  



 

8  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and each Mykrolis
SEC Report at the time of its filing complied as to form in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC. Since January 1, 2002, Mykrolis has filed in a timely
manner all reports that it was required to file with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC.



(ii) The consolidated financial statements contained in the Mykrolis SEC
Reports were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Mykrolis and its
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and consolidated cash flows of Mykrolis and its Subsidiaries for
the periods indicated, subject, in the case of interim financial statements,
to normal year-end adjustments, and except that the interim financial
statements do not contain all of the footnote disclosures required by
generally accepted accounting principles.



(iii) Except as and to the extent reflected or reserved against on the most
recent balance sheet contained in the Mykrolis SEC Reports filed prior to the
date hereof (the "Mykrolis Balance Sheet"), neither Mykrolis nor any of its
Subsidiaries had, as of the date of the Mykrolis Balance Sheet, any material
obligations or liabilities of any nature that as of such date would have been
required to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Mykrolis prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect on
that date. From the date of the Mykrolis Balance Sheet to the date of this
Agreement, neither Mykrolis nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
obligations or liabilities of any nature that are currently outstanding that
would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, a consolidated
balance sheet of Mykrolis dated as of the date of this Agreement prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, other than those arising in the ordinary course
of business (including trade indebtedness) since the date of the Mykrolis
Balance Sheet and those that individually or in the aggregate would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis.



(iv) The chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Mykrolis
have made all certifications required by, and nothing has come to their
attention that would preclude them from being able to make such certifications
as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as if required to be made
as of such dates pursuant to, Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct, and Mykrolis is otherwise in
compliance with all applicable effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the applicable listing standards and corporate governance rules of the
NYSE.



(v) Neither Mykrolis nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership or any similar
contract or arrangement (including without limitation any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
Mykrolis and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
affiliate, including without limitation any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand), where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries in Mykrolis or its
Subsidiaries published financial statements.



(f) _Information to be Supplied by Mykrolis_. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Mykrolis for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the registration statement to be filed with the
SEC by Entegris and Eagle Delaware in connection with the issuance of shares
of Eagle Delaware Common Stock in the Merger (the "Registration Statement")
will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be  



 

9  supplied by or on behalf of Mykrolis for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the joint proxy statement, in definitive form, relating to the
Mykrolis Shareholders Meeting and the Entegris Shareholders Meeting (as
defined in Section 4.02(c)(ii)) to be held in connection with the
Reincorporation Merger and the Merger, or in the related proxy and notice of
meeting, or soliciting material used in connection therewith (referred to
herein collectively as the "Joint Proxy Statement") will, at the dates mailed
to shareholders and at the times of the Mykrolis Shareholders Meeting and the
Entegris Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement (except for information supplied by or on behalf of Entegris or
Eagle Delaware for inclusion therein) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder.



(g)  _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. From the date of the Mykrolis
Balance Sheet to and including the date of this Agreement, Mykrolis and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses and operations in the
ordinary course consistent with past practices and neither Mykrolis nor any
of its Subsidiaries has:



(i) split, combined, or reclassified any shares of its capital stock or made
any other changes in its equity capital structure; 



(ii) purchased, redeemed, or otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly, any
shares of its capital stock or any options, rights, or warrants to purchase
any of its capital stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable
for any of its capital stock;



(iii) declared, set aside, or paid any dividend or made any other
distribution in respect of shares of its capital stock, except for dividends
or distributions by any of its Subsidiaries to Mykrolis or another wholly
owned Subsidiary of Mykrolis;



(iv) issued any shares of its capital stock or granted any options, rights, or
warrants to purchase any such capital stock or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable for any such capital stock, except (A) issuances of

incentive plans in accordance with the terms of such plans, (B) grants of
options for 500 shares of Mykrolis Common Stock pursuant to Mykrolis incentive
plans, (C) issuances of shares of Mykrolis Common Stock pursuant to the
Mykrolis Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and (D) the issuance of
Mykrolis Rights under the Mykrolis Rights Agreement in connection with the
issuance of Mykrolis Common Stock permitted pursuant to this Agreement;



(v) purchased any business, purchased any stock of any corporation other than
Mykrolis, or merged or consolidated with any person; 



(vi) sold, leased, licensed, or otherwise disposed of, pledged, granted a
security interest in, or encumbered any assets or properties that were
material to Mykrolis and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than sales
or other dispositions in the ordinary course of business, or Permitted Liens
(as defined in Section 10.08);



(vii) incurred, assumed, or guaranteed any indebtedness for money borrowed
other than (A) borrowings incurred for working capital purposes under
Mykrolis existing revolving credit facilities, and (B) intercompany
indebtedness; 



(viii) changed or modified in any material respect any existing accounting
method, principle, or practice, other than as required by generally accepted
accounting principles;



(ix) increased the compensation or benefits of any officer or director of
Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries, other than consistent with past

foregoing;

effect to insurance coverage) that would be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis; or



(xiii) entered into a contract or agreement with respect to any other
agreement or arrangement, the effect of which would have the same result as
the occurrence of any of the foregoing.



(h) _Tax Matters_.



(i) Mykrolis and its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or received appropriate
extensions of time to file) all federal, state, local, and foreign tax
returns, reports, forms, or other similar statements ("Tax Returns") required
to be filed by them with respect to gross income, net income, gross receipts,
withholding, social security, unemployment, payroll, franchise, property,
excise, sales, use, and other taxes of whatever kind and any interest,
penalty, or addition to tax attributable thereto ("Taxes"), except for Tax
Returns the non-filing of which would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis, and have paid all Taxes shown on such
Tax Returns to the extent they have become due. Mykrolis and its Subsidiaries
have paid all Taxes due and payable (whether or not shown on any Tax Return)
except for Taxes the nonpayment of which would not reasonably be likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis.



(ii) No Tax Return filed by Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries is the subject
of any pending or, to the knowledge of Mykrolis, threatened audit, suit,
proceeding, or claim by any Governmental Body (as defined in Section 10.08) as

appropriate governmental authorities all material Taxes required by law to

by any Tax allocation or sharing agreement or arrangement other than (i) such

with respect to Mykrolis and each of its Subsidiaries.

individually or in the aggregate, could give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.



(ix) There are no Liens or encumbrances for Taxes on any of the assets of
Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Liens.

Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled

Spin Off.



(xiv) Mykrolis has made available to Entegris a true and correct copy
(deleting confidential names) of that certain private letter ruling (the
"Ruling"), issued by the IRS in connection with the Spin Off, and neither

All of the foregoing that are set forth or are required to be set forth in the
Mykrolis Disclosure Schedule are collectively called "Mykrolis Material
Contracts." To the extent Mykrolis Material Contracts are evidenced by
documents, true and complete copies thereof have been delivered or made
available to Entegris. Each Mykrolis Material Contract is in full force and
effect, unless the failure of any Mykrolis Material Contract to be in full
force and effect would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Mykrolis. Neither Mykrolis nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of Mykrolis, any other party is in breach of or in default under any
of the Mykrolis Material Contracts, except for breaches or defaults which
would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis.



(j) _Intellectual Property_. The Mykrolis Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and correct list of all material patents and registered trademarks,
trade names, registered service marks, and registered copyrights, and all
material applications for any of the foregoing owned by Mykrolis and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. With such exceptions as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis, to the knowledge of Mykrolis, Mykrolis
or one of its Subsidiaries is the sole owner of or has the right to use
without the payment of any fee or royalty to any other person (other than
pursuant to Mykrolis Material Contracts or other agreements the non-disclosure
of which therein does not constitute a misrepresentation under Section
4.01(i)) all Intellectual Property necessary to carry on their respective
businesses substantially as currently conducted. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Mykrolis nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice that any material Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively
licensed to Mykrolis and/or its Subsidiaries has been declared unenforceable
or otherwise invalid by any court or governmental agency. As of the date of
this Agreement, there is, to the knowledge of Mykrolis, no material existing
infringement, misappropriation or other violation by others of any
Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to Mykrolis and/or
its Subsidiaries. From January 1, 2002 to the date of this Agreement, neither
Mykrolis nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice alleging
that the operation of the business of Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries
either infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates in any material
respect the Intellectual Property rights of others. Neither Mykrolis nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to any settlements, covenants not to sue,
consents, decrees, stipulations, judgments, or orders resulting from suits,
actions or similar legal proceedings which (i) restrict the rights of Mykrolis
or any of its Subsidiaries to use any Intellectual Property material to the
business of Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, (ii)
restrict in any material respect the conduct of business of Mykrolis or any of
its Subsidiaries as currently conducted in order to accommodate any third

Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA for which no exemption exists under Section 408

all applicable federal, state and foreign laws, rules, and regulations
respecting employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, and wages and hours, in each case, with respect to employees of

Mykrolis, any threatened, labor dispute, grievance, or litigation relating to
labor, safety, or discrimination matters involving any employee of Mykrolis or
any of its Subsidiaries, including charges of unfair labor practices or
discrimination complaints, which would reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis. There has been no engagement in any
unfair labor practices by Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries within the
meaning of the National Labor Relations Act which would reasonably be likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis.



(ix) Section 4.01(n) of the Mykrolis Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of: (A) all employment agreements with employees of
Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries (other than at-will offer letters that

Subsidiaries who have executed a  



 

15  non-competition agreement with Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries; (C) all

its Subsidiaries with or relating to its employees, excluding programs and
policies required to be maintained by Law; and (D) all plans, programs,

or lapse of repurchase rights) may be required, or may become payable directly
or indirectly as a result of or in connection with, the negotiation or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the execution of, this
Agreement. True, complete and correct copies of each of the foregoing
agreements to which any employee of Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party have been made available to Entegris. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Merger nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will constitute a "change of
control" or similar event under any employment or severance plan, program,
agreement or other arrangement with Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries.



(x) There are no personnel manuals or handbooks applicable to employees of
Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries, other than those set forth in Section

written summaries of which have heretofore been provided to Entegris.



(xi) No employee of Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries (A) to Mykrolis
knowledge, is in violation of any term of any patent disclosure agreement,
non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer
relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by Mykrolis or any
of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business conducted or
presently proposed to be conducted by Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries or
relating to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of others, or
(B) in the case of any key employee or group of key employees, has given

notice and other requirements under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988, as amended (the "WARN Act"), and any similar
foreign, state or local Law relating to plant closings and layoffs. Neither
Mykrolis nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently engaged in any layoffs

Environmental Law and no condition or event has occurred with respect to
Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries that would constitute a violation of such
Environmental Law or result in any unpaid liability under any Environmental
Law, excluding, in any event, such violations, conditions, and events that
would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis.

Mykrolis possession or control that relate to any of its (or any of its
Subsidiaries) currently or previously owned or leased real property.

maintained during the immediately preceding three-year period, policies of
insurance with respect to all material properties, assets, and
business activities of Mykrolis and each of its Subsidiaries against such
casualties, risks, and contingencies as are customarily insured against by
entities owning similar properties or assets or engaged in similar business
activities.



(q) _Amendments to Mykrolis Rights Agreement._  The Board of Directors of
Mykrolis has amended the Mykrolis Rights Agreement to provide that (i)
Entegris will not become an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Mykrolis
Rights Agreement) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger, (ii) no "Distribution Date," or "Common Stock
Event" (as such terms are defined in the Mykrolis Rights Agreement) will occur

outstanding Mykrolis Rights issued and outstanding under the Mykrolis Rights
Agreement will expire immediately before the Effective Time.



(r) _Opinion of Financial Adviser._ Mykrolis Board of Directors has received
the opinion of Citigroup to the effect that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the consideration to be received by the holders of Mykrolis Common
Stock (other than Entegris or any Subsidiary of Mykrolis or Entegris) in the
Merger is fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view.



(s) _Ownership of Entegris Common Stock._ As of the date of this Agreement,

officer, director, partner, member, consultant, or employee of Mykrolis or any
of its Subsidiaries, is a party to any material contract or transaction
with Mykrolis or any of its Subsidiaries, including any material contract or
arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing for
rental of real or personal property (including intellectual property) to or
from, or otherwise requiring payments to or from, Mykrolis or any of its
Subsidiaries. Since the date of the Mykrolis Balance Sheet, no event has
occurred that would be required to be reported as a Certain Relationship or
Related Transaction pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 57 or Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the SEC that has not been so reported
in the Mykrolis SEC Reports.



(u) _Disclosure Controls and Procedures._ Since August 14, 2003, Mykrolis and
each of its Subsidiaries has had in place "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) reasonably designed and maintained to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Mykrolis in the reports that it files or submits to the SEC under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to  



 

17  Mykrolis management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of Mykrolis required under the

preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets, (iii) access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is

or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(w) _Properties and Assets._



(i) Mykrolis or a Subsidiary of Mykrolis has good and valid (and, in the case
of real property, fee simple) title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all
the real and tangible properties and assets which it purports to own or lease,
including all the properties and assets reflected in the Mykrolis
Balance Sheet (except for personal property sold since the date of the
Mykrolis Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice). All properties and assets reflected in the Mykrolis Balance Sheet
are free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens reflected on the Mykrolis
Balance Sheet and Liens for current taxes not yet due and other Liens, other
than for borrowed money, that do not materially impair the use or operation of
the property or assets subject thereto. 



(ii) Section 4.01(w) of the Mykrolis Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of all real property owned by Mykrolis or its
Subsidiaries and the location of such premises. All material real property
leases, licenses or other occupancy agreements to which Mykrolis or a
Subsidiary of Mykrolis is a party or for which it is obligated (whether as
lessor or tenant) (collectively, the "Mykrolis Real Property Leases") are
either filed as exhibits to the Mykrolis SEC Reports filed with the SEC prior
to the date hereof or complete copies thereof have been delivered to or made
available to Entegris. Section 4.01(w) of the Mykrolis Disclosure Schedule
lists all Mykrolis Real Property Leases other than the Mykrolis Real Property
Leases which are listed as an exhibit to Mykrolis most recent annual report
on Form 10-K or a subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q.



(iii) Each Mykrolis Real Property Lease is in full force and effect, unless
the failure of any Mykrolis Real Property Lease to be in full force and
effect would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Mykrolis. Neither Mykrolis nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the knowledge
of Mykrolis, any other party is in breach of or in default under any Mykrolis
Real Property Lease, except for breaches or defaults which would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Mykrolis.

liability company to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where  



 

18  the character of the properties owned, operated, or leased by it, or the
nature of its business, makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified, licensed, or in
good standing would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Entegris. Complete and correct copies of the Articles or Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws or similar charter or organizational documents of
Entegris and each of its Subsidiaries have been made available to Mykrolis.



(b) _Capitalization._ The authorized capital stock of Entegris consists solely

of the limited liability company interests of each of its limited liability
company Subsidiaries, have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully

which Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries is or may become obligated to
issue, sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, or purchase, redeem, or
otherwise acquire, any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries, and there are no outstanding

restricted stock units for shares of Entegris Common Stock pursuant to the
terms of the restricted stock units. There are no preemptive rights, rights of
first refusal, rights of first offer, or any similar rights granted by
Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the securities of Entegris
or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights, or performance shares
outstanding with respect to Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries or similar
agreements or commitments obligating Entegris or any Subsidiary of Entegris to
make cash payments pursuant to any stock based or stock related plan based on
the market price performance of Entegris Common Stock. The shares of Eagle
Delaware Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement, when issued in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully

Merger, when issued, will be registered under the Securities Act and Exchange
Act and registered or exempt from registration under any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws. Entegris owns, directly or indirectly, all of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or limited liability
company interests of every class of each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear
of all Liens, security interests, pledges, charges, and other encumbrances.
The Entegris Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct list of each
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, or other
business association in which Entegris has any direct or indirect equity
ownership interest, including the nature of the equity interest held by
Entegris therein. There are no voting trusts or agreements or arrangements to
which Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which Entegris
otherwise has knowledge with respect to the voting of its capital stock.

statute, law, ordinance, rule, or regulation applicable to Entegris or any of
its Subsidiaries or any injunction, judgment,  



 

20  order, writ or decree to which Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective assets has been specifically identified as subject; or
(iv) result in a breach of, or constitute a default or an event that, with or
without the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute
a default, give rise to a right of termination, cancelation, or acceleration,
create any entitlement of any third party to any material payment or benefit,
require notice to or the consent of any third party, or result in the creation
of any Lien on the assets of Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries under, any
Entegris Material Contract (as defined in Section 4.02(i)), except, in the
case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), where the violation, breach, default,
termination, cancelation, acceleration, payment, benefit, or Lien, or the
failure to make such filing or obtain such consent or approval would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Entegris.



(e) _SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.



(i) Entegris has made available to Mykrolis, in the form filed with the SEC,
its (A) Annual Report on Form 10-K for each of its fiscal years ended August,
2002 through August, 2004, (B) all proxy statements relating to Entegris
meetings of shareholders (whether annual or special) held since September 1,
2001, and (C) all other reports, registration statements and other filings
(including amendments to previously filed documents) filed by Entegris with
the SEC since September 1, 2001 (all such reports, proxy statements,
registration statements, and filings, other than the Registration Statement
and the Joint Proxy Statement, being herein collectively called the "Entegris
SEC Reports" and individually called a "Entegris SEC Report"). Taking into
account any amendments and supplements filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, no Entegris SEC Report, as of its filing date, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
and each Entegris SEC Report at the time of its filing complied as to form in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC. Since September 1,
2001, Entegris has filed in a timely manner all reports that it was required
to file with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC. Eagle Delaware will be treated as a
"successor issuer" within the meaning of Rule 12g-3 under the Exchange Act and
the Eagle Delaware Common Stock will, at and after the Reincorporation Merger
Effective Time, be registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and be
approved for quotation on NASDAQ.



(ii) The consolidated financial statements contained in the Entegris SEC
Reports were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Entegris and its
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and consolidated cash flows of Entegris and its Subsidiaries for
the periods indicated, subject, in the case of interim financial statements,
to normal year-end adjustments, and except that the interim financial
statements do not contain all of the footnote disclosures required by
generally accepted accounting principles.



(iii) Except as and to the extent reflected or reserved against on the most
recent balance sheet contained in the Entegris SEC Reports filed prior to the
date hereof (the "Entegris Balance Sheet"), neither Entegris nor any of its
Subsidiaries had, as of the date of the Entegris Balance Sheet, any material
obligations or liabilities of any nature that as of such date would have been
required to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Entegris prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect on
that date. From the date of the Entegris Balance Sheet to the date of this
Agreement, neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
obligations or liabilities of any nature that are currently outstanding that
would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, a consolidated
balance sheet of Entegris dated as of the date of this Agreement prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, other than those arising in the ordinary course
of business (including trade indebtedness) since the date of the Entegris
Balance Sheet and those that individually or in the aggregate would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Entegris.



 

21 (iv) The chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Entegris
have made all certifications required by, and nothing has come to their
attention that would preclude them from being able to make such certifications
as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as if required to be made as
of such dates pursuant to, Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the statements
contained in any such certifications are complete and correct, and Entegris is
otherwise in compliance with all applicable effective provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing standards and corporate
governance rules of the NASDAQ.



(v) Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership or any
similar contract or arrangement (including without limitation any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
Entegris and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
affiliate, including without limitation any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand), where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries in Entegris or its Subsidiaries
published financial statements.



(f) _Information to be Supplied by Entegris and Eagle Delaware_. None of
the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Entegris or
Eagle Delaware for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under
the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by or on behalf of Entegris or Eagle Delaware for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the dates mailed to
shareholders and at the times of the Mykrolis Shareholders Meeting and the
Entegris Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement (except for information supplied by or
on behalf of Mykrolis for inclusion therein) will comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.



(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. From the date of the Entegris

its Subsidiaries has:



(i) split, combined, or reclassified any shares of its capital stock or made
any other changes in its equity capital structure;



(ii) purchased, redeemed, or otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly, any
shares of its capital stock or any options, rights, or warrants to purchase

in respect of shares of its capital stock, except for dividends or
distributions by any of its Subsidiaries to Entegris or another wholly owned
Subsidiary of Entegris;

warrants to purchase any such capital stock or any securities convertible into
or exchangeable for any such capital stock, except (A) issuances of shares of

restricted stock units under Entegris incentive plans in accordance with the
terms of such plans, (B) grants of options for 19,500 shares of Entegris
Common Stock pursuant to Entegris incentive plans, (C) issuances of 6,500
shares of Entegris Common Stock pursuant to restricted stock grants under
Entegris  



 

22  incentive plans in accordance with the terms of such plans, and (D)

Stock Purchase Plan;



(v) purchased any business, purchased any stock of any corporation other than
Entegris, or merged or consolidated with any person;



(vi) sold, leased, licensed, or otherwise disposed of, pledged, granted a
security interest in, or encumbered any assets or properties that were
material to Entegris and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than sales
or other dispositions in the ordinary course of business or Permitted Liens;



(vii) incurred, assumed, or guaranteed any indebtedness for money borrowed
other than (A) borrowings incurred for working capital purposes under
Entegris existing revolving credit facilities, and (B) intercompany
indebtedness;



(viii) changed or modified in any material respect any existing accounting
method, principle, or practice, other than as required by generally accepted
accounting principles;



(ix) increased the compensation or benefits of any officer or director of
Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries, other than consistent with past practice;



(x) entered into or amended any contract, agreement, employment, severance, or
special pay arrangement with any employee of Entegris or any of its
Subsidiaries, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice;



(xi) except for this Agreement, entered into any commitment to do any of the
foregoing;



(xii) suffered any business interruption, damage to, or destruction of its
properties or other incident, occurrence, or event or change (after giving

Material Adverse Effect on Entegris; or



(xiii) entered into a contract or agreement with respect to any other
agreement or arrangement, the effect of which would have the same result as
the occurrence of any of the foregoing.



(h) _Tax Matters_.



(i) Entegris and its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or received appropriate
extensions of time to file) all Tax Returns required to be filed by them with
respect to Taxes, except for Tax Returns the non-filing of which would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Entegris, and have
paid all Taxes shown on such Tax Returns to the extent they have become
due. Entegris and its Subsidiaries have paid all Taxes due and payable
(whether or not shown on any Tax Return) except for Taxes the nonpayment of
which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Entegris.



(ii) No Tax Return filed by Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries is the
subject of any pending or, to the knowledge of Entegris, threatened audit,
suit, proceeding, or claim by any Governmental Body as of the date of this
Agreement. Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries has received, as of
the date of this Agreement, a notice of material deficiency or assessment of
material additional Taxes that remains unresolved.



(iii) Entegris and its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid over to the
appropriate governmental authorities all material Taxes required by law to
have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, shareholder or other third party except for
Taxes the nonpayment of which would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Entegris.



(iv) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]



(v) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 



(vi) Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound
by any Tax allocation or sharing agreement or arrangement other than such an
agreement or arrangement exclusively between and among Entegris and its wholly
owned Subsidiaries.



 

23 (vii) Entegris has delivered or made available to Mykrolis true and complete
copies of all requested federal, state, local, and foreign income tax returns
with respect to Entegris and each of its Subsidiaries.



(viii) There is no contract, agreement, plan, or arrangement covering any
employee or former employee of Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, could give rise to the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.



 

(ix) There are no Liens or encumbrances for Taxes on any of the assets of
Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Liens.



(x) The charges, accruals, and reserves for Taxes with respect to Entegris
and its Subsidiaries reflected on the Entegris Balance Sheet are adequate
under generally accepted accounting principles to cover the Tax liabilities of
Entegris and its Subsidiaries accruing through the date thereof.



(xi) Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or is
aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent
or impede the Merger from being treated for federal income tax purposes as a

(xii) Within the past five years, neither Entegris nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled

(xiii) Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a member
of any group of corporations filing a consolidated tax return for United
States federal income tax purposes (except the group of which Entegris is the
parent).



(xiv) The Reincorporation Merger qualifies as a reincorporation under section
368(a)(1)(F) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Eagle Delaware
has conducted no business activities since its formation and was organized
solely for the purpose of effecting the reincorporation of Entegris in
Delaware.



(xv) Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability
for any Taxes of any Person, other than Entegris or its Subsidiaries, under
Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-6 or any comparable provision of state,
local or foreign law, or as a transferee, successor or by contract.

 



(i) _Entegris Material Contracts_. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any:



(i) employment agreement (other than those that are terminable by Entegris or

notice);



(ii) material Intellectual Property agreement (other than non-negotiated
licenses of commercially available computer software);



(iii) loan or guaranty agreement, indenture or other instrument, contract, or
agreement under which any money has been borrowed or loaned and has not been
repaid in full or any note, bond, or other evidence of indebtedness has been

Regulation S-K of the SEC).



All of the foregoing that are set forth or are required to be set forth in the
Entegris Disclosure Schedule are collectively called "Entegris Material
Contracts." To the extent Entegris Material Contracts are evidenced by
documents, true and complete copies thereof have been delivered or made
available to Mykrolis. Each Entegris Material Contract is in full force and
effect, unless the failure of any Entegris Material Contract to be in full
force and effect would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Entegris. Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of Entegris, any other party is in breach of or in default under any
of the Entegris Material Contracts, except for breaches or defaults which
would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Entegris.



(j) _Intellectual Property_. The Entegris Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and correct list of all material patents and registered trademarks,
trade names, registered service marks, and registered copyrights, and all
material applications for any of the foregoing owned by Entegris and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. With such exceptions as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Entegris, to the knowledge of Entegris, Entegris
or one of its Subsidiaries is the sole owner of or has the right to use
without the payment of any fee or royalty to any other person (other than
pursuant to Entegris Material Contracts or other agreements the non-disclosure
of which therein does not constitute a misrepresentation under Section
4.02(i)) all Intellectual Property necessary to carry on their respective
businesses substantially as currently conducted. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice that any material Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively
licensed to Entegris and/or its Subsidiaries has been declared unenforceable
or otherwise invalid by any court or governmental agency. As of the date of
this Agreement, there is, to the knowledge of Entegris, no material existing
infringement, misappropriation or other violation by others of any
Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to Entegris and/or
its Subsidiaries. From January 1, 2002 to the date of this Agreement, neither
Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice alleging
that the operation of the business of Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries
either infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates in any material
respect the Intellectual Property rights of others. Neither Entegris nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to any settlements, covenants not to sue,
consents, decrees, stipulations, judgments, or orders resulting from suits,
actions or similar legal proceedings which (i) restrict the rights of Entegris
or any of its Subsidiaries to use any Intellectual Property material to the
business of Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, (ii)
restrict in any material respect the conduct of business of Entegris or any of
its Subsidiaries as currently conducted in order to accommodate any third
partys Intellectual Property rights, or (iii) permit third parties to
use any material Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to
Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries.



(k) _Litigation_. There is no litigation, arbitration, or administrative
proceeding pending against or, to the knowledge of Entegris, threatened
against Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement
that, if decided adversely to such person, would be reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Entegris, or that seeks to enjoin or otherwise
challenges the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Entegris nor any of its
Subsidiaries is specifically identified as a party subject to any material
restrictions or limitations under any injunction, writ, judgment, order, or
decree of any court, administrative agency, commission, or other  



 

25  governmental authority. There has not been nor are there currently any
internal investigations or inquiries being conducted by Entegris, the Entegris
Board of Directors (the "Entegris Board"), or any committee thereof, or any
third party at the request of any of the foregoing concerning any financial,
accounting, tax, conflict of interest, self-dealing, fraudulent or deceptive
conduct or other misfeasance or malfeasance issues.



(l)  _Permits, Licenses, Authorizations; Compliance with Laws_. Entegris and
each of its Subsidiaries has all licenses, franchises, permits, and other
governmental authorizations (including those required under any
Environmental Laws) necessary to conduct its business, except where the
failure to have any such license, franchise, permit, or other governmental
authorization would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Entegris. Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of
any such license, franchise, permit, or other governmental authorization, or
any statute, law, ordinance, rule, or regulation (including any Environmental
Laws) applicable to it or any of its properties, except where the existence
of any such violation would not be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Entegris.



(m) _No Brokers or Finders_. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co. ("Goldman
Sachs"), neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged any
investment banker, broker, or finder in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. A copy of the engagement agreement with Goldman Sachs,
together with all other agreements in effect with Goldman Sachs, has been
provided to Mykrolis and except as set forth therein, no other fees are
payable to Goldman Sachs with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.



(n) _Employment Matters_.



(i) Each Pension Plan, Welfare Plan, and Benefit Plan that is currently
maintained by Entegris or any of its ERISA Affiliates (as defined below) or
with respect to which Entegris or any of its ERISA Affiliates is under any
current obligation to contribute or has liability, whether current or
contingent (collectively, the "Entegris Employee Plans" and individually, a
"Entegris Employee Plan"), is listed in the Entegris Disclosure Schedule and,
to the extent an Entegris Employee Plan is evidenced by documents, true and
complete copies thereof have been delivered or made available to Mykrolis. In
addition, copies of the summary plan descriptions of each Benefit Plan, copies
of the most recent determination letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to each Pension Plan, copies of the most recent actuarial
report for each such Pension Plan, where applicable, and copies of the annual
report (Form 5500 Series) required to be filed with any governmental agency
with respect to each such Pension Plan and each such Welfare Plan for the most
recent plan year of such plan for which reports have been filed have been
delivered or made available to Mykrolis.



(ii) Each of Entegris and its ERISA Affiliates has made on a timely basis all
contributions or payments required to be made by it under the terms of the
Entegris Employee Plans, ERISA, the Code, or other applicable laws, unless
such contributions or payments that have not been made are immaterial in
amount and the failure to make such payments or contributions will not
materially and adversely affect the Entegris Employee Plans. No Pension Plan
constituting an Entegris Employee Plan that is subject to Section 412 of the
Code has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in that
section), whether or not material, as of the last day of the most recent plan
year of the plan.



(iii) Each Entegris Employee Plan (and any related trust or other funding
instrument) is being administered in all material respects in compliance with
its terms and in both form and operation is in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, and other
applicable laws and regulations (other than adoption of any plan amendments
for which the deadline has not yet expired), and all material reports required
to be filed with any governmental agency with respect to each Pension Plan
and each Welfare Plan constituting an Entegris Employee Plan have been timely
filed.



(iv) There is no material litigation, arbitration, or administrative
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Entegris, threatened against
Entegris or any of its ERISA Affiliates or, to the knowledge  



 

26  of Entegris, any plan fiduciary by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S.
Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or any
participant or beneficiary with respect to any Entegris Employee Plan as of
the date of this Agreement. Neither Entegris nor any of its ERISA Affiliates
nor, to the knowledge of Entegris, any plan fiduciary of any Pension Plan or
Welfare Plan constituting an Entegris Employee Plan has engaged in any
transaction in violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA for which no
exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or any "prohibited transaction"
(as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code) for which no exemption exists
under Section 4975(c)(2) or 4975(d) of the Code, or is subject to any excise
tax imposed by the Code or ERISA with respect to any Entegris Employee Plan.



(v) Neither Entegris nor any of its ERISA Affiliates currently maintains, nor
at any time in the previous six calendar years maintained or had an
obligation to contribute to, any defined benefit pension plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA, or any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.



(vi) For purposes of this Section 4.02(n), the term "ERISA Affiliate" means
(A) any trade or business with which Entegris is under common control within
the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA, (B) any corporation with which
Entegris is a member of a controlled group of corporations within the meaning
of Section 414(b) of the Code, (C) any entity with which Entegris is under
common control within the meaning of Section 414(c) of the Code, (D) any
entity with which Entegris is a member of an affiliated service group within
the meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code, and (E) any entity with which
Entegris is aggregated under Section 414(o) of the Code.



(vii) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Entegris, Entegris and its Subsidiaries (A) are in compliance with
all applicable federal, state and foreign laws, rules, and regulations
respecting employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, and wages and hours, in each case, with respect to employees of
any of them; (B) have withheld all amounts required by law or by agreement to
be withheld from the wages, salaries, and other payments to employees of any
of them; (C) are not liable for any arrears of wages or any taxes or any
penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing; and (D) other than
routine payments to be made in the normal course of business and consistent
with past practice, are not liable for any payment to any trust or other fund
or to any governmental or administrative authority, with respect to
unemployment compensation benefits, Social Security, or other benefits for
employees of any of them.



(viii) Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining or other union contract. As of the date of this
Agreement, no work stoppage or labor strike with respect to any employee of
Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of
Entegris, is threatened. There is no pending nor, to the knowledge of
Entegris, any threatened, labor dispute, grievance, or litigation relating to
labor, safety, or discrimination matters involving any employee of Entegris or
any of its Subsidiaries, including charges of unfair labor practices or
discrimination complaints, which would reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Entegris. There has been no engagement in any
unfair labor practices by Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries within the
meaning of the National Labor Relations Act which would reasonably be likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Entegris.



(ix) Section 4.02(n) of the Entegris Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of: (A) all employment agreements with employees of
Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries (other than at-will offer letters that
are consistent with Entegris general form and do not provide for severance
payments or benefits, notice periods for termination or change of control
benefits); (B) all employees or former employees of Entegris or any of its
Subsidiaries who have executed a non-competition agreement with Entegris or
any of its Subsidiaries; (C) all severance agreements, programs and policies
of Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries with or relating to its employees,
excluding programs and policies required to be maintained by Law; and (D) all
plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of Entegris or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which payments (or acceleration of benefits or
vesting of options or lapse of repurchase rights) may be required, or may
become payable directly or indirectly as  



 

27  a result of or in connection with, the negotiation or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, or the execution of, this Agreement. True,
complete and correct copies of each of the foregoing agreements to which any
employee of Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries is a party have been made
available to Mykrolis. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Reincorporation Plan of Merger nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will constitute a "change of control" or
similar event under any employment or severance plan, program, agreement or
other arrangement with Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries.



(x) There are no personnel manuals or handbooks applicable to employees of
Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries, other than those set forth in Section
4.02(n) of the Entegris Disclosures Schedule, true and complete copies or
written summaries of which have heretofore been provided to Mykrolis.



(xi) No employee of Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries (A) to Entegris
knowledge, is in violation of any term of any patent disclosure agreement,
non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer
relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by Entegris or any
of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business conducted or
presently proposed to be conducted by Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries or
relating to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of others, or
(B) in the case of any key employee or group of key employees, has given
notice as of the date of this Agreement to Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries
that such employee or any employee in a group of key employees intends to
terminate his or her employment with Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries.



(xii) Each of Entegris and its Subsidiaries is and has been in compliance with
all notice and other requirements under the WARN Act, and any similar foreign,
state or local Law relating to plant closings and layoffs. Neither Entegris
nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently engaged in any layoffs or employment
terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of the WARN Act or
any similar state, local or foreign Law.



(o) _Environmental Matters_.



(i) Except as would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Entegris, (A) no real property currently or formerly owned or
operated by Entegris or any Subsidiary of Entegris is contaminated with any
Hazardous Substances to an extent or in a manner or condition now
requiring remediation under any Environmental Law, (B) neither Entegris nor
any Subsidiary of Entegris has any material unpaid liability for any off-site
disposal of Hazardous Substances, and (C) neither Entegris nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received in writing any claims or notices alleging liability
under any Environmental Law. Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in violation of any applicable Environmental Law or has any unpaid liability
under any Environmental Law and no condition or event has occurred with
respect to Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries that would constitute a
violation of such Environmental Law or result in any unpaid liability under
any Environmental Law, excluding, in any event, such violations, conditions,
and events that would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Entegris.



(ii) The Entegris Disclosure Schedule lists all environmental assessments in
Entegris possession or control that relate to any of its (or any of its
Subsidiaries) currently or previously owned or leased real property. Entegris
has delivered to Mykrolis true and complete copies of all environmental

has maintained during the immediately preceding three-year period, policies
of insurance with respect to all material properties, assets, and business

risks, and contingencies as are customarily insured against by entities
owning similar properties or assets or engaged in similar business activities.



 

28 (q) _Opinion of Financial Adviser_. Entegris Board of Directors has received

fair to Entegris from a financial point of view.

(s) ___Transactions with Affiliates_ __. Except for transactions between or
among Entegris and any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries, and except for
contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business that are no less
advantageous to Entegris and its Subsidiaries than market terms in all
material respects, no affiliate of Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries nor any
shareholder, officer, director, partner, member, consultant, or employee of
Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries, is a party to any material contract or
transaction with Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries, including any material
contract or arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by,
providing for rental of real or personal property (including
intellectual property) to or from, or otherwise requiring payments to or
from, Entegris or any of its Subsidiaries. Since the date of the Entegris
Balance Sheet, no event has occurred that would be required to be reported as
a Certain Relationship or Related Transaction pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 57 or Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the SEC
that has not been so reported in the Entegris SEC Reports.



(t) _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_. Since August 14, 2003, Entegris and
each of its Subsidiaries has had in place "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) reasonably designed and maintained to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Entegris in the reports that it files or submits to the SEC under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to Entegris management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Entegris
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Entegris
maintains internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements
general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for
assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.



(u) _Anti-Takeover Statute Not Applicable_. No Takeover Statute is applicable
to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(v) _Properties and Assets_.



(i) Entegris or a Subsidiary of Entegris has good and valid (and, in the case
of real property, fee simple) title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all
the real and tangible properties and assets which it purports to own or lease,
including all the properties and assets reflected in the Entegris Balance
Sheet (except for personal property sold since the date of the Entegris
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice). All properties and assets reflected in the Entegris Balance Sheet
are free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens reflected on the Entegris
Balance Sheet and Liens for current taxes not yet due and other Liens, other
than for borrowed money, that do not materially impair the use or operation of
the property or assets subject thereto.



(ii) Section 4.02(v) of the Entegris Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of all real property owned by Entegris or its
Subsidiaries and the location of such premises. All material real property
leases, licenses or other occupancy agreements to which Entegris or a
Subsidiary  



 

29  of Entegris is a party or for which it is obligated (whether as lessor or
tenant) (collectively, the "Entegris Real Property Leases") are either filed
as exhibits to the Entegris SEC Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date
hereof or complete copies thereof have been delivered to or made available to
Mykrolis. Section 4.02(v) of the Entegris Disclosure Schedule lists all
Entegris Real Property Leases other than the Entegris Real Property Leases
which are listed as an exhibit to Entegris most recent annual report on Form
10-K or a subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q.



(iii) Each Entegris Real Property Lease is in full force and effect, unless
the failure of any Entegris Real Property Lease to be in full force and effect
would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Entegris.
Neither Entegris nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the knowledge
of Entegris, any other party is in breach of or in default under any Entegris
Real Property Lease, except for breaches or defaults which would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Entegris.

_ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_



 

6.01. _No Solicitation._



(a) Except as set forth in Section 6.01 of the Mykrolis Disclosure Schedule,
from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement, each of Entegris and Mykrolis (each an
"Applicable Party") shall not and shall not authorize or permit any
Subsidiary, officer, director, financial adviser, representative, or agent
of it or its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:



(i) solicit, seek, initiate, or knowingly encourage any inquiries or proposals
that constitute, or would be reasonably likely to lead to, a proposal or offer
for (A) a merger, consolidation, or business combination involving the
Applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries (other than a merger of a wholly
owned Subsidiary of an Applicable Party into the Applicable Party or another
of its wholly owned Subsidiaries), (B) a sale of assets representing an amount
equal to or greater than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Applicable
Party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (other than the sale or other
disposition of inventory or obsolete equipment in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice), (C) a sale of shares of capital
stock of the Applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries (including without
limitation by way of a tender offer or exchange offer) that would result in
any person or group beneficially owning 10% or more of any class or series of
equity securities of the Applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any
similar transaction involving the Applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries,
other than the transactions required by this Agreement, or (D) the
consummation of any other transaction or the entering into of any other
agreement or arrangement with respect to any other transaction, the effect of
which would have the same result as the occurrence of the preceding clauses
(A), (B), or (C) (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals, other than
those that relate to matters set forth in Section 6.01 of the Mykrolis
Disclosure Schedule, being referred to in this Agreement as a "Third Party
Acquisition Proposal");



(ii) engage in discussions or negotiations or enter into any agreement with
any person or group other than the other Applicable Party or its affiliates (a
"Third Party") concerning any Third Party Acquisition Proposal, or provide any
non-public information regarding, or afford access to the properties, books,
records, or personnel of, the Applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries, to
any Third Party that is considering making, or has made, any Third Party
Acquisition Proposal; or



(iii) agree to or recommend any Third Party Acquisition Proposal;



_provided_ , _however_ , that, at any time prior to the time Shareholders
Approval with respect to the Applicable Party is obtained and if the
Applicable Party is not otherwise in material breach of its obligations under
this Section 6.01, nothing contained in this Section 6.01 shall prevent
the Applicable Party from furnishing non-public information pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement at least as favorable to the Applicable Party as the
Confidentiality Agreements (as defined in Section 6.13) or affording access to
the properties, books, records, and personnel of the Applicable Party or any
of its Subsidiaries to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any
Third Party in connection with a Third Party Acquisition Proposal by such
Third Party or recommending any Third Party Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
clause (iii) hereof if and only to the extent the Board of Directors of the
Applicable Party, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, determines in good
faith by a majority vote (after consultation with its financial and legal
advisers) that such Third Party Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined). For purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a Third Party Acquisition Proposal
(except that all references to "10% or more" or "25%" in the definition of
Third Party Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority") that was not solicited in violation of this Agreement and that, in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Applicable Party,
taking into account, to the extent deemed appropriate by such Board of
Directors, the various legal, financial, and regulatory aspects of the Third
Party Acquisition Proposal and the person or group making such proposal, (A)
if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and (B) if consummated,
is reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is more favorable to the
Applicable Party shareholders (in their capacity as shareholders), from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

33 (b) Nothing in this Section 6.01 shall operate to hinder or prevent either
Entegris or Mykrolis from fully complying with Rule 14e-2 or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Third Party Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not
in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such
rules has under Section 9.01 or Section 10.04.



(c) Each of Entegris and Mykrolis agrees not to release any third party from,
or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to
which it is a party, unless the Board of Directors thereof, in the exercise of
its fiduciary duties, determines in good faith by a majority vote (after
consultation with its financial and legal advisers) that such action is
required. Notwithstanding anything stated in this Section 6.01(c), neither
Entegris nor Mykrolis need refuse a request from any person who has signed a
standstill agreement with such party to make a Third Party Acquisition
Proposal to the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors thereof if
the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, in the
exercise of its fiduciary duties, after consultation with its legal counsel,
that such action is required.



(d) Each of Entegris and Mykrolis will notify the other promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt by it (or any of its advisers) of any
request (other than in the ordinary course of business and not related to a
Third Party Acquisition Proposal) for non-public information relating to it
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to its properties, books, or records
or any of its Subsidiaries by any person who is known to be considering
making, or has made, a Third Party Acquisition Proposal or of an inquiry from
a third party seeking to have discussions or negotiations relating to, or
make, a possible Third Party Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be
provided orally and in writing and shall identify the terms and conditions of
any such Third Party Acquisition Proposal, indication, or request, including
the identify of the party making the Third Party Acquisition Proposal,
indication, or request and shall be accompanied by copies of all agreements or
proposed agreements related thereto. Each Applicable Party shall keep the
other reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (but in any event no later than
24 hours following any written correspondence from any person known to be
contemplating a Third Party Acquisition Proposal), of the status and
details of any such Third Party Acquisition Proposal, indication, or request
and shall provide such other party with copies of all agreements and proposed
agreements related to such Third Party Acquisition Proposal.



(e) Each of Entegris and Mykrolis shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and the directors, employees, financial advisers,
representatives, and other agents of it and its Subsidiaries to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated all discussions or negotiations with
any persons conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Third
Party Acquisition Proposal.



(f) Except as set forth in Section 9.01, nothing set forth in this Section
6.01 shall (i) permit any party hereto to terminate this Agreement, (ii)
affect any other obligation of the parties under this Agreement, (iii) limit
either Entegris or Mykrolis obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold its respective Shareholders Meeting, (iv) relieve either Entegris or
Mykrolis of its obligation to submit to a vote of its shareholders or
stockholders either the Entegris Voting Proposal or the Mykrolis Voting
Proposal, as appropriate, at its respective Shareholders Meeting, or (v)
except to the extent required by law, permit either party hereto to submit for
a vote of its respective shareholders or stockholders at or prior to its
respective Shareholders Meeting any Third Party Acquisition Proposal.

discovered by Mykrolis that should be set forth in an amendment to the
Registration Statement or a supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement, Mykrolis
shall promptly so inform Entegris.



(c) Entegris and Eagle Delaware shall take such action as may be necessary to
ensure that (i) the information supplied by Entegris and Eagle Delaware for
inclusion in the Registration Statement shall not at the time the Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated in the
Registration Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in the
Registration Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and (ii) the information supplied by Entegris and Eagle
Delaware for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement, or included or supplied
by or on behalf of Entegris or Eagle Delaware for inclusion in any Regulation

officers, or directors is discovered by Entegris that should be set forth in
an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement, Entegris shall promptly so inform Mykrolis.



(d) Each of Mykrolis, Entegris and Eagle Delaware shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and, as
soon as practicable thereafter, shall cause copies of the Joint Proxy
Statement and form of proxy pursuant thereto to be mailed to their respective
shareholders and stockholders in accordance with applicable provisions of
Law. 



6.03. ___Access to Information_ __. Upon reasonable notice and to the extent
permitted under applicable Law and the provisions of agreements to which
Entegris or Mykrolis, as the case may be, is a party, each of Mykrolis and

Subsidiaries and the investigating party will take all reasonable precautions
to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all information described in
this Section 6.03, as required under the Confidentiality Agreements (as
defined in Section 6.13). No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be deemed to modify a

Rule 14d-9, in which case the Applicable Party shall provide as much notice in
advance of the Applicable Partys Shareholders Meeting or the filing of a
Schedule 14d-9, as applicable, as is reasonably practical) specifying
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and providing a
written copy thereof) and identifying the person or persons making such
Superior Proposal and (ii) if, during the foregoing five business day period,
the party hereto that has received the foregoing notice shall make a
counterproposal to the party hereto that is proposing to effect a Change of
Recommendation, the party that is proposing to take such action shall consider
and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate on its behalf in good

the parties under this Agreement, (iii) limit either partys obligation to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold its respective Shareholders
Meeting, (iv) relieve either party hereto of its obligation to submit to a
vote of its shareholders or stockholders the Entegris Voting Proposal or the

Voting Proposal or the Entegris Voting Proposal, respectively.



(f) Mykrolis shall submit the Mykrolis Voting Proposal to its stockholders at
the Mykrolis Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of acting upon such
proposal whether or not (i) the Mykrolis Board at any time subsequent to the
date of this Agreement effects a Change of Recommendation or (ii) any actual,
potential or purported Third Party Acquisition Proposal or Superior

one of its Subsidiaries) prior to the date hereof in the ordinary course of
administering its (or such Subsidiarys) employee benefits.



  

43 (c) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.01,

and exculpation existing in favor of any present or former director, officer,
or employee of Entegris, Mykrolis or any of their respective Subsidiaries as

charter or organizational documents of Entegris and Mykrolis or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or by law as in effect on the date hereof shall
survive the Merger for a period of at least six years after the Effective

occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including consummation of the
Reincorporation Merger and the Merger). To the fullest extent permitted by
law, Eagle Delaware hereby assumes, effective at the Effective Time, all
obligations provided by statute or charter or organizational documents of each

indemnification and exculpation to any other person, to the extent of such
contractual obligation and shall enter into indemnification agreements with
all persons who were officers or directors of Entegris immediately prior to

the indemnification agreements Mykrolis has with its officers and directors
immediately prior to the Effective Time.



8.03. _Directors and Officers Liability Insurance_. For a period of at least
six years after the Effective Time, Eagle Delaware shall maintain in effect
either (a) the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by Entegris and Mykrolis ( _provided_ _that_ Eagle
Delaware may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous in any
material respect to the insured parties thereunder) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time
(including consummation of the Reincorporation Merger and the Merger), or (b)
a run-off (i.e., "tail") policy or endorsement with respect to the current
policy of directors and officers liability insurance covering claims
asserted within six years after the Effective Time arising from facts or
events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (including consummation
of the Reincorporation Merger and the Merger); and such policies
or endorsements shall name as insureds thereunder all present and former
directors and officers of Entegris, Mykrolis and any of their respective
Subsidiaries; _provided_ _that_ if the aggregate annual premiums for such
insurance during such period shall exceed 200% of the per annum rate of
premium paid by Entegris or Mykrolis, as applicable, then Eagle Delaware shall
provide a policy with the best coverage as shall then be available at 200% of
such rate. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
abide by and honor each of Entegris and Mykrolis contractual obligations, if
any, to provide directors and officers liability insurance to any other
person, to the extent of such contractual obligation.

Directors shall initially consist of ten directors, five of whom initially

different then-existing Entegris director) and five of whom initially shall be
then-existing Mykrolis directors designated by Mykrolis and identified in
Section 8.04(b) of the Mykrolis Disclosure  



 

44  Schedule (as such list may be revised by Mykrolis prior to the Effective

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Entegris and Eagle Delaware

for the purpose of effecting the reincorporation of Entegris in Delaware.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants set
forth herein, Entegris and Eagle Delaware hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



1.1 _Plan Adopted_. This Plan of Merger of each of the Constituent
Corporations pursuant to the provisions of Section 252 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law and Sections 302A.611, 302A.613 and 302A.615 of the Minnesota
Business Corporation Act is adopted as follows:

(1) At the Effective Time, as hereinafter defined, Entegris shall be merged
with and into Eagle Delaware (the "Reincorporation Merger").



(2) The surviving corporation of the Reincorporation Merger (the
"Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation") shall be Eagle Delaware and
the name of Eagle Delaware shall be "Entegris, Inc." (3) At the Effective Time, the separate existence of Entegris shall cease and
the Reincorporation Merger shall have the other effects set forth in the
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Minnesota Business
Corporation Act.



(4) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Reincorporation Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, each share of common stock of
Entegris, par value $.01 per share ("Entegris Common Stock"), the only
authorized class of capital stock of Entegris, shall be automatically
converted into one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common
Stock").



(5) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Reincorporation Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock of
Eagle Delaware, par value $.01 per share ("Eagle Delaware Common Stock"),
outstanding and owned by Entegris, constituting the only Eagle Delaware
capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, or held
by Eagle Delaware as treasury shares, shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no stock, cash or other property shall be issued in respect
thereof.



1.2 _Effective Time_. Following (i) the requisite approval of this Plan of
Merger and the Reincorporation Merger by the shareholders of Entegris and the
stockholder of Eagle Delaware, (ii) the execution and filing with the
Secretary of State of Delaware of a Certificate of Merger pursuant to Section
252 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and (iii) the execution and filing
with the Secretary of State of Minnesota of Articles of Merger pursuant to
Section 302A.615 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, the
Reincorporation Merger shall become effective in Delaware upon the filing of
such Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware and in
Minnesota upon the filing of such Articles of Merger with the Secretary of
State of Minnesota (the "Effective Time").



1.3 _No Appraisal or Dissenters Rights_. In accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and Section 302A.471 of
the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, no holder of shares of Entegris Common
Stock or Eagle Delaware Common Stock shall have any appraisal or dissenters
rights as a result of the execution and delivery of this Plan of Merger or
the consummation of the Reincorporation Merger.



ARTICLE II 



EXCHANGE OF SHARES



2.1 _Entegris Stock Certificates_. At or after the Effective Time,
each holder of shares of Entegris Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, upon surrender to the Reincorporation Merger Surviving
Corporation of the certificates which, prior to the Effective Time, evidenced
outstanding shares of Entegris Common Stock, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a certificate or certificates representing the number of
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which such shares of
Entegris Common Stock shall have been converted as provided in Section
1.1(4). Nothing stated herein shall require a holder of a certificate which
represented a share of Entegris Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time to surrender such certificate. After the Effective Time, and
until so surrendered, each such outstanding certificate for such shares of
Entegris Common Stock that have been converted into shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock in accordance with this Plan of Merger will be deemed
for all corporate purposes of the Reincorporation Merger Surviving
Corporation to evidence ownership of, and represent, the number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which such shares of Entegris Common
Stock were converted at the Effective Time. The registered owner on the books
and records of the transfer agent of Eagle Delaware of any such outstanding
certificate for shares of Entegris Common Stock shall, until such certificate
shall have been surrendered for transfer, have and be entitled to all
rights of a holder of Surviving Corporation Common Stock with respect to each
share represented by such certificate, including all voting rights and rights
to dividends and other distributions upon the shares of the Reincorporation
Merger Surviving Corporation represented by such outstanding certificate. The
Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to issue
new  



 

2  certificates evidencing such shares of its capital stock unless and until
the old certificates formerly representing shares of Entegris Common Stock
are either delivered to the Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation, or
in any particular case the registered holder thereof notifies the
Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation that such certificates have been
lost, stolen, or destroyed and complies with the provisions of Article IX of
this Plan of Merger.



2.2 _Eagle Delaware Stock Certificates_. At or after the Effective Time,
Entegris shall surrender the certificates which, prior to the Effective Time,
evidenced the outstanding shares of Eagle Delaware Common Stock to
the Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation for cancellation and no
stock, cash or other property shall be issued in respect thereof. After the
Effective Time, and until so surrendered, no outstanding certificate for such
shares of Eagle Delaware Common Stock outstanding prior to the
Reincorporation Merger shall be deemed for any corporate purpose to represent
any interest in Eagle Delaware or the Reincorporation Merger Surviving
Corporation or to entitle the holder thereof to any stock, cash or other
property.



ARTICLE III



CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS



At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
Eagle Delaware, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Reincorporation Merger

order that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Eagle Delaware shall be in the forms attached
hereto as _Exhibits A-1_ and _A-2_ , respectively, unless and to the extent
the parties agree to changes therein (in which case the parties agree to
cause the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Eagle Delaware to be in
such forms, with such changes as are agreed upon by the parties, immediately
prior to the Effective Time), _provided_ , _however_ , if any provision of
such Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (i) is required to be submitted
separately to the shareholders of Entegris for approval by such shareholders
at the time of their approval of the Reincorporation Merger and (ii) does not
receive the approval of the Entegris shareholders, then the Certificate of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of Eagle Delaware as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall not include such provisions.



ARTICLE IV



DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS



4.1 _Directors_. From and after the Effective Time, the Directors of Eagle
Delaware shall be the directors of the Reincorporation Merger Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office until his or her successor is duly elected
and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.

shall be officers of the Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation, each to
hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until
his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.



ARTICLE V



STOCK OPTIONS, ETC.



At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Eagle Common Stock and each restricted stock unit that may be surrendered for
Eagle Common Stock that has been granted under any employee stock option or
compensation plan of, or other arrangement with, Eagle shall become an option
or restricted stock unit, as the case may be, for the same number of shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock as the number of shares of Eagle Common
Stock for which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, it was exercisable
or could  



 

3  be surrendered, subject to the same vesting schedule, forfeiture provisions
and exercise price, as applicable, in effect immediately before the
Effective Time. Restricted stock of Entegris that is converted into
restricted stock of Eagle Delaware as a result of the Reincorporation Merger
shall be subject to the same vesting schedule and forfeiture provisions, as
applicable, in effect immediately before the Effective Time.



ARTICLE VI



AMENDMENT

Plan of Merger, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
Constituent Corporation, at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after approval by the shareholders of Entegris and the stockholder
of Eagle Delaware, provided that after the shareholders or stockholder
approval of a Constituent Corporation is obtained, there shall be no further
amendment that by law or the rules of the NASDAQ National Market requires
further approval by the shareholders or stockholder of that Constituent
Corporation without the further approval of those shareholders or stockholder.



ARTICLE VII



TERMINATION



To the extent permitted by law, this Plan of Merger may be terminated, and
the Reincorporation Merger herein provided for may be abandoned, by mutual
consent of the Boards of Directors of the Constituent Corporations at any time
prior to the Effective Time. The Boards of Directors of the Constituent
Corporations shall terminate this Plan of Merger at such time, if any, as the
Agreement and Plan of Merger among Entegris, Eagle Delaware and Mongoose,
dated as of the date of this Plan of Merger, is terminated. Except
as otherwise provided in this Article VII, the Reincorporation Merger shall
be submitted to the shareholders of Entegris and the stockholder of Eagle
Delaware whether or not the Board of Directors of either Constituent
Corporation recommends that the shareholders or stockholder of that
Constituent Corporation reject it.



ARTICLE VIII



FURTHER ASSURANCES 



If at any time the Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation shall
consider or be advised that any further assignments or assurances in law or
any other acts are necessary or desirable to vest in the Reincorporation
Merger Surviving Corporation, according to the terms hereof, the title to
any property or right of either Constituent Corporation, the proper officers
and directors of either Constituent Corporation shall and will execute and
make all such proper assignments and assurances and do all things necessary to
vest title in such property or rights in the Reincorporation Merger Surviving
Corporation, and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.



ARTICLE IX



LOST OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES



In the case of any lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate formerly
representing shares of Entegris Common Stock, the holder thereof may be
required, as a condition precedent to the delivery to the holder
of certificates for the same number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock, to deliver to the Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation a
written indemnity agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation and, if reasonably deemed
advisable by the Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation, a bond in such
reasonable sum as the Reincorporation Merger Surviving  



 

4  Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against any transfer or exchange agent, Entegris or the Reincorporation
Merger Surviving Corporation or any of their respective officers, directors,
agents or affiliates with respect to the certificate formerly representing
shares of Entegris Common Stock alleged to have been lost, stolen, or
destroyed.



ARTICLE X

As of the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Entegris of the shares of Entegris Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, after the Effective Time, if certificates formerly representing
shares of Entegris Common Stock are presented to Eagle Delaware for transfer,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the same number of shares of Eagle
Delaware Common Stock as provided in Articles I and II. After the Effective
Time, the Reincorporation Merger Surviving Corporation shall cause the shares
of Entegris Common Stock to be delisted from NASDAQ and at or prior to the
Effective Time, Eagle Delaware shall take such action as is necessary to cause
Eagle Delaware to be treated as a "successor issuer" to Entegris within the
meaning of Rule 12g-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange
Act"), as amended, and shall cause the shares of Eagle Delaware Common Stock

included in each such series, and to fix the designation,
powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series and any
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The number of authorized
shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the

the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such
holders is required pursuant to the terms of any Preferred Stock Designation.



_ARTICLE V _



Unless and except to the extent that the By-Laws of this Corporation shall so
require, the election of directors need not be by written ballot.



_ARTICLE VI_



In furtherance of and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute,
the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the
By-Laws of this Corporation, subject to the right of the stockholders entitled
to vote with respect thereto to alter and repeal the By-Laws adopted or
amended by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, the By-Laws shall
not be altered, amended or repealed by the stockholders of the Corporation
except by the affirmative vote of holders of not less than seventy-five
percent (75%) of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the

Incorporation or the By-Laws, each as amended, and notwithstanding the fact
that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, this Certificate of
Incorporation or the By-Laws of the    Corporation, the affirmative vote of seventy-five percent (75%) of the then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors shall be required to amend or repeal,
or to adopt any provisions inconsistent with the purpose or intent of, this

into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III. No one class shall have
more than one director more than any other class.



3\. _Terms of Office_. Except as provided in Section 4 of this Article IX,
each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual

that purpose, notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be

of this Corporation.



7\. _Amendment to Article_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, this
Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws, each as amended, and

affirmative vote of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors shall be required to amend or repeal,
or to adopt any provisions inconsistent with the purpose or intent of, this
Article IX.

1\. _Dividends_. The Board of Directors shall have authority from time to
time to set apart out of any assets of the Corporation otherwise available for
dividends a reserve or reserves as working capital or for any other purpose or
purposes, and to abolish or add to any such reserve or reserves from time to
time as said board may deem to be in the interest of the Corporation; and

available for dividends in excess of such reserve or reserves shall be
declared in dividends and paid to the stockholders of the Corporation.



2\. _Location of Meetings, Books and Records_. Except as otherwise provided in

supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors,
(b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of

meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual
meeting by a stockholder, if such business relates to the election of
directors of the Corporation, the procedures in Section 2.11 must be complied
with. If such business relates to any other matter, the stockholder must have
given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a
stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the

public disclosure was made, whichever occurs first. A stockholders notice to
the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to
bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business

conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as

stockholder proposal which complies with Rule 14a-8 or any successor provision
or Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and is to be included in the Corporations proxy statement for an
annual meeting of stockholders shall be deemed to comply with the requirements
of this Section 2.13.

to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in

of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a
committee, the member or members of the committee present at any meeting and
not disqualified from voting, whether or not he, she or they constitute a
quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to
act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any

5.4 _Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may determine
the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders, or to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or
allotment of any rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may, except as otherwise required by law, fix a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which record date shall not
be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any
meeting of stockholders, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the time for
such other action as hereinbefore described; provided, however, that if
no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held, and,
for determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise any rights of
change, conversion or exchange of stock or for any other purpose, the record
date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts a resolution relating thereto.



A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote
at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.



 

8 5.5 _Dividends_. Subject to limitations contained in the Delaware General
Corporation Law, the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-laws, the

between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association,
or other organization in which one or more of the directors or officers
are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or
voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is
present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or a
committee of the Board of Directors which authorizes the contract or
transaction or solely because his, her or their votes are counted for such
purpose, if:



(1) The material facts as to his, her or their relationship or interest and as
to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of
Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee of the
Board of Directors in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the

of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the Corporation or of
its subsidiaries, including any officer or employee who is a Director of the
Corporation or its subsidiaries, whenever, in the judgment of the Directors,
such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the
Corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without
interest, and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of
Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of
stock of the Corporation. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to deny,
limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the Corporation at
common law or under any statute.

ARTICLE 7  INDEMNIFICATION



7.1 _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was
a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer or trustee of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an
"indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer or trustee or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer or trustee, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but,
in the case of any such  



 

10  amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the
Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that,
except as provided in Section 7.3 of this Article 7 with respect to
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.



7.2 _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in Section 7.1 of this Article 7, an indemnitee
shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses");
provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an
advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of
an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under Section 7.1 or otherwise.



7.3 _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit._ If a claim under Section 7.1 or 7.2
of this Article 7 is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60)
days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the
case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable
period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter
bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.
If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms
of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the
expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it
shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to
recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking,
the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither
the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the
circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties
to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses
hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that
the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this Article 7 or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.



7.4 _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses conferred in this Article 7 shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws, agreement,
vote of stockholders or directors or otherwise.



7.5 _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other  



 

11  enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.



7.6 _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation_. The
Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of
Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses
to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement
of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.



7.7 _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article
7 shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee
who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the
benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article 7 that adversely affects any
right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall
not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving
any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that
took place prior to such amendment or repeal.



ARTICLE 8  AMENDMENTS



8.1 _By the Board of Directors_. These By-Laws may be altered, amended or
repealed or new By-Laws may be adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority
of the directors present at any regular or special meeting of the Board of
Directors at which a quorum is present.



8.2 _By the Stockholders_. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, and notwithstanding the fact
that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the shares of the capital
stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote shall be
required to alter, amend or repeal any provision of these By-Laws or to adopt
new By-Laws.
