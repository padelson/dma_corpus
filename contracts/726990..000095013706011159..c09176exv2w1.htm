as a director of Far West or Far West Bank. Nothing in this Voting Agreement shall be deemed in
any manner to limit the discretion of Shareholder to take any action, or fail to take any action,
in his or her capacity as a director of Far West or Far West Bank, that may be required of
Shareholder in the exercise of his or her duties and responsibilities as a director of Far West or

means any direct or indirect communication of any kind,
regardless of who initiates it, that in any way invites, advises, encourages or

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Agreement</U>. Director agrees that for the period commencing on the Effective Date
(as defined in the Merger Agreement) and ending on the date that is the 24-month anniversary of the

its affiliates or to apply for or accept employment with, or to act as an agent, consultant,
independent contractor or partner in, any other business or enterprise. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to prohibit general advertising or solicitation not directed at any or all of
the Clients or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates. For purposes of subsection (iv)
of this Section&nbsp;1(c), Director shall not be prohibited from soliciting any former employees of the
Company or its affiliates who have been terminated by the Company or one of its affiliates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>Confidentiality</U>. Director hereby acknowledges that, as a director of Far West
and/or Far West Bank, he makes use of, acquires and adds to confidential information of a special
and unique nature and value relating to Far West and Far West Bank and their respective strategic
plans and financial operations (such information, the <B>&#147;</B><I>Confidential Information</I><B>&#148;</B>). Director
further recognizes and acknowledges that all Confidential Information is the exclusive property of
Far West or Far West Bank, as the case may be, is material and confidential, and is critical to the
successful conduct of the business of Far West or Far West Bank, as the case may be. Accordingly,
Director hereby covenants and agrees that he will use Confidential Information for the benefit of
the Company only and shall not at any time, directly or indirectly, during the term of this
Agreement and thereafter, divulge, reveal or communicate any Confidential Information to any
person, firm, corporation or entity whatsoever, or use any Confidential Information for his own
benefit or for the benefit of others.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <U>Separate Covenants</U>. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to
enforce any of the separate covenants (or any part thereof) contained in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section&nbsp;1, then such unenforceable covenants (or such part) shall be deemed eliminated from
this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining
separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <U>Reformation</U>. In the event that the provisions of this Section&nbsp;1 should ever be
deemed to exceed the duration or geographic limitations or scope permitted by applicable law, then
such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations or scope, as the
case may be, permitted by applicable laws.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <U>Specific Performance</U>. Director acknowledges that it would be impossible to
determine the amount of damages that would result from any breach of any of the provisions of this
Section&nbsp;1 and that the remedy at law for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such
provisions would likely be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that AmericanWest shall, in addition
to any other rights or remedies which it may have, be entitled to seek such equitable and
injunctive relief as may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain Director
from violating any of such provisions of this Agreement. In connection with any action or
proceeding for injunctive relief, Director hereby waives the claim or defense that a remedy at law
alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to have each such provision
of this Section&nbsp;1 specifically enforced against Director, without the necessity of posting bond or
other security against Director, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief against Director
enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such provisions of this Section&nbsp;1.

breach of this Agreement by Director or AmericanWest) shall have no effect on the continuing
operation of this Section&nbsp;1.

written instrument signed by authorized representatives of both parties and referring specifically
to this Agreement. No waiver of any breach or default hereunder shall be considered valid unless
in writing and signed by the party giving such waiver, and no such waiver shall be deemed a waiver
of any subsequent breach of the same or similar nature.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Counterparts</U>. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts or facsimile counterparts, each such counterpart being
deemed to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and
the same agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Attorney&#146;s Fees</U>. The prevailing party or parties in any litigation, arbitration,
mediation, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding (<B>&#147;</B><I>Proceeding</I><B>&#148;</B>) relating to the enforcement or
interpretation of this Agreement may recover from the unsuccessful party or parties all reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel (including expert witness and other consultants&#146; fees and costs)
relating to or arising out of (a)&nbsp;the Proceeding (whether or not it proceeds to judgment) and (b)
any post judgment or post-award proceeding including, without limitation, one to enforce or collect
any judgment or award resulting from the Proceeding. All such judgments and awards shall contain a
specific provision for the recovery of all such subsequently incurred costs, expenses, and fees and
disbursements of counsel.

validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to the
conflicts of law principles thereof.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of Far
West Bancorporation, a Utah corporation (the <I>&#147;Company&#148;</I>), as the term &#147;affiliate&#148; is defined for
purposes of paragraphs (c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 (&#147;Rule&nbsp;145&#148;) of the Rules and Regulations (the
&#147;<I>Rules and Regulations</I>&#148;) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;<I>SEC</I>&#148;) under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;<I>Act</I>&#148;). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October &#95;&#95;&#95;, 2006 (the &#147;<I>Merger Agreement</I>&#148;), by and
between AmericanWest Bancorporation (&#147;<I>AmericanWest</I>&#148;) and the Company, the Company will be merged
into AmericanWest (the &#147;<I>Merger</I>&#148;), and that as a result of the Merger, I may be eligible to receive
shares of common stock of AmericanWest (&#147;<I>AmericanWest Common Stock</I>&#148;) in exchange for shares of
Company Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) owned by me.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby represent, warrant and covenant to AmericanWest that in the event I receive any
AmericanWest Common Stock pursuant to the Merger:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the AmericanWest Common Stock
in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements
and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
AmericanWest Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or with counsel for
the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;I have been advised that any issuance of AmericanWest Common Stock to me pursuant to the
Merger Agreement has been registered with the SEC on a registration statement on Form S-4.
However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company for approval I may be an &#147;affiliate&#148; of the Company, any sale or
disposition by me of any of the AmericanWest Common Stock may only be made, under current law, in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 under the Act, pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Act or pursuant to an exemption thereunder. I agree that I will
not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of AmericanWest Common Stock issued to me in the Merger
unless (i)&nbsp;such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act; (ii)&nbsp;such
sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of
Rule&nbsp;144 promulgated by the SEC under the Act; or (iii)&nbsp;in the written opinion of counsel, which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to AmericanWest, such sale, transfer or other
disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;I understand that AmericanWest is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or
other disposition of the AmericanWest Common Stock by me or on my behalf or to

with respect to AmericanWest Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for the

substance:

pursuant to a registration statement under said act or an exemption from such

were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule
145 promulgated under the Securities Act applies. The shares have been acquired by
the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution
thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that this letter agreement shall terminate and be of no further
force and effect and the legends set forth in paragraphs (5)&nbsp;or (6)&nbsp;above, as the case may be,
shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and the related stop
transfer of restrictions shall be lifted forthwith, if (i)&nbsp;any such shares of AmericanWest Common
Stock shall have been registered under the Act for sale, transfer or other disposition by me or on
my behalf and are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or (ii)&nbsp;any such shares of
AmericanWest Common Stock are sold in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), (f)
and (g)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;144 promulgated under the Act, or (iii)&nbsp;I am not at the time an affiliate of
AmericanWest and have been the beneficial owner of the AmericanWest Common Stock for at least one
year (or such other period as may be prescribed by the Act and the Rules and Regulations), and
AmericanWest has filed with the SEC all of the reports it is required to file under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the preceding 12&nbsp;months, or (iv)&nbsp;I am not and have not
been for at least three months an affiliate of AmericanWest and have been the beneficial owner of
the AmericanWest Common Stock for at least two years (or such other period as may be prescribed by
the Act and the Rules and Regulations), or (v)&nbsp;AmericanWest shall have received a letter from the
Staff of the SEC, or a written opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to AmericanWest, to the effect that the stock transfer restrictions and the legend are
not required.
