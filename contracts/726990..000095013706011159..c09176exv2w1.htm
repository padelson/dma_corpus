 (a) _Parent Common Stock_. Each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Parent Common Stock as to which a shareholder has taken the actions required by Section 23B.13.230 of the WBCA to exercise dissenters rights) shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of Parent and shall not be affected by the Merger. 

  

 (b) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Dissenters Shares and Treasury Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive either Parent Common Stock or cash as provided herein. 

  

 (c) _Company Dissenters  Shares_. All shares of Company Common Stock as to which a shareholder has taken the actions required by Section 16-10a-1323 of the URBCA relating to dissenters rights (" _Company Dissenters  Shares_") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Parent Common Stock or cash hereunder unless and until such shares have lost their status as dissenting shares, at which time such shares shall either be converted into cash or Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.08. 

  

 (d) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or the Company or the Company Bank, other than those held in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted (" _Treasury Shares_ "), shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

The " _Company Common Stock Value_ " as calculated immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent shall mean an amount equal to (i) $150,000,000 divided by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 3.03. _Election and Proration Procedures_. 

  

 (a) _Election Forms and Types of Elections_. An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the exchange agent selected by Parent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")) in such form and substance as designated by Parent (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed at Parents expense no less than 40 days prior to the Effective Time or on such earlier date as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of a date of Parents choice which is at least three Business Days prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_"). Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may be reasonably requested by all persons who become holders of Company Common Stock after the Election Form Record Date and prior to the Election Deadline, and the Company shall promptly provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein. Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to elect (an " _Election_ ") to receive either (i) Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") with respect to all of such holders shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") with respect to all of such holders shares of Company Common Stock, or (iii) Parent Common Stock in exchange for a specified number of shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Combination Stock Election_ ") and cash in exchange for a specified number of shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Combination Cash Election_ "). Any shares of Company Common Stock (other than Company Dissenters Shares or Treasury Shares) with respect to which the holder (or indirectly the beneficial owner) shall not have submitted to the Exchange Agent an effective, properly completed Election Form, which was received prior to the Election Deadline, shall be deemed to be an "undesignated share" (each an " _Undesignated Share_ ") hereunder. 

  

 (b) _Proper and Timely Election_. Any Election shall have been properly made and effective only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by 5:00 P.M. Central Time on the 30th day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the Company and Parent may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ "). An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if an Election is indicated for each share of Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form and if accompanied by one or more certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included in or required by the Election Form. Any
Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such
Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form
is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall automatically become Undesignated
Shares unless and until a new Election is properly and timely made with
respect to such shares on or before the Election Deadline, and Parent shall
cause the certificates representing such shares of Company Common Stock to be
promptly returned without charge to the person submitting the revoked
Election Form upon written request to that effect from the holder who
submitted such Election Form. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of
the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion
to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and
any decisions of Parent and Company required by the Exchange Agent and made
in good faith in determining such matters shall be binding and conclusive.
Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify
any person of any defect in an Election Form. 

  

 (c) _Allocation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration in the Merger (the " _Cash Election Number_ ") shall be equal to 20% of the difference between (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the number of Company Dissenters Shares, if any. The number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration in the Merger (the " _Stock Election Number_ ") shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger less the sum of (i) the Cash Election Number and (ii) the number of Company Dissenters Shares, if any. 

  

 (d) _Proration_. As promptly as practicable but not later than the Effective Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive Parent Common Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows: 

   

 (i) In the event that the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which Cash Elections and Combination Cash Elections have been made (collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ ") exceeds the Cash Election Number, all shares in respect of which Stock Elections and Combination Stock Elections have been made (the " _Stock Election Shares_ ") and all Undesignated Shares in respect of which Stock Elections are deemed to have been made (it being understood that in such case all Undesignated Shares shall be deemed to be shares in respect of which Stock Elections have been made) shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration, and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration in the following manner: 

   

 (A) that number of Cash Election Shares which represent in excess of 20% of the total number of shares of Company Common Stock held by any Company shareholder (" _Excess Cash Election Shares_ ") shall be deemed 

   ##### 

  

    

converted to Stock Election Shares, on a pro-rata basis for each record
holder of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to those shares, if
any, of such record holder that are Excess Cash Election Shares, so that the
number of Excess Cash Election Shares so converted, when added to the
existing Stock Election Shares, shall equal as closely as practicable
the Stock Election Number, and all such Excess Cash Election Shares so
converted shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration
(and cash in lieu of fractional shares); and 

   

 (B) any remaining Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration. 

   

 (ii) In the event that the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares exceeds the Stock Election Number, all Cash Election Shares and all Undesignated Shares in respect of which Cash Elections are deemed to have been made (it being understood that in such case all Undesignated Shares shall be deemed to be shares in respect of which Cash Elections have been made) shall be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration, and all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration in the following manner: 

   

 (A) Stock Election Shares shall be deemed converted into Cash Election Shares, on a pro-rata basis for each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to those shares, if any, of such record holder that are Stock Election Shares, so that the number of Stock Election Shares so converted, when added to the existing Cash Election Shares, shall equal as closely as practicable the Cash Election Number, and all such Stock Election Shares so converted shall be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration; and 

   

 (B) the remaining Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). 

   

 (iii) In the event that neither clause (i) nor clause (ii) of this Section 3.03(d) is applicable, Undesignated Shares, on a pro rata basis, shall be deemed Stock Election Shares such that the total number of Stock Election Shares equals the Stock Election Number and any remaining Undesignated Shares shall be deemed Cash Election Shares and (A) all Cash Election Shares and all Undesignated Shares in respect of which Cash Elections are deemed to have been made shall be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration, and (B) all Stock Election Shares and all Undesignated Shares in respect of which Stock Elections are deemed to have been made shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares). 

  

 (e) _Calculations_. Any calculation of a portion of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share, and any cash payment shall be rounded to the nearest cent. 

  

 3.04. _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company other than to receive the consideration provided under this Article III. After the 

   ##### 

  

    

Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company of shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

 3.05. _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger; instead, Parent shall pay to each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all certificates of Company Common Stock delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction by the Parent Measuring Price. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights as a shareholder in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 3.06. _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger and the amount of cash payable in the Merger (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, and any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Parent. 

  

 (b) _Exchange of Certificates and Cash_. After completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 3.03, each holder of a certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (other than Company Dissenters Shares or Treasury Shares) who surrenders or has surrendered such certificate (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificate), together with duly executed transmittal materials included in or required by the Election Form, to the Exchange Agent shall, upon acceptance thereof, be entitled to a certificate representing Parent Common Stock and/or cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock shall have been converted pursuant hereto, as well as cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock upon compliance with such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.06, each certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive cash and/or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, upon such surrender. Parent shall not be obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former holder of Company Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his certificate or certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Article III. If any certificate for shares of Company Common Stock, or any check representing cash and/or declared but unpaid dividends, is to be issued in a name other than that in which a certificate surrendered for exchange is issued, the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such exchange shall affix any requisite stock transfer tax stamps to the certificate

surrendered or provide funds for their purchase or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes are not payable. 

  

 (c) _Delivery of Payment_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each former holder of Company Common Stock who surrendered such former holders certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock together with duly executed transmittal materials included in or required by the Election Form prior to the Election Deadline the shares of Parent Common Stock or cash to which such former holder is entitled; provided, however, that Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to any such former holder who is entitled to receive cash in the amount of $1,000,000 or more such amount on the Effective Date (or next Business Day thereafter if the Effective Date is not a Business Day) by wire transfer provided that such holder has provided proper wire transfer instructions on the Election Form. 

  

 (d) _Affiliates_. Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act shall not be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock until Parent has received a written agreement from such person as provided in Section 6.06. 

  

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (f) _Voting and Dividends_. Former shareholders of record of the Company shall not be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent shareholders until such holders have exchanged their certificates representing Company Common Stock for certificates representing Parent Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.06, each certificate theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock (other than Company Dissenters Shares and Treasury Shares) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or cash as set forth in this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate of Company Common Stock with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, until the holder of such certificate of Company Common Stock shall surrender such certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such certificates of Company Common Stock for which shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates without interest, (i) the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.05 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) _Unclaimed Portion of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be paid to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of cash, shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. 

  

 3.07. _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event Parent or the Company changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Date, the amount of Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration per share shall be proportionately adjusted. If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, Parent shall merge, be acquired or consolidate with, by or into any other corporation (a " _Business Combination_ ") and the terms thereof shall provide that Parent Common Stock shall be converted into or exchanged for the shares of any other corporation or entity, then provision shall be made as part of the terms of such Business Combination so that shareholders of the Company who would be entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of each share of Parent Common Stock issuable to such shareholders as provided herein, the same kind and amount of securities or assets as shall be distributable upon such Business Combination with respect to one share of Parent Common Stock (provided that nothing herein shall be construed so as to release the acquiring entity in any such Business Combination from its obligations under this Agreement as the successor to Parent). 

  

 3.08. _Company Dissenters  Rights_. 

  

 (a) _No Consideration_. Any Company Dissenting Shareholder who shall be entitled to be paid the value of such shareholders shares of Company Common Stock, as provided in Part 13 of Title 16, Chapter 10a of the URBCA, shall not be entitled to Merger Consideration in respect thereof provided for under Section 3.01 unless and until such Company Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Company Dissenting Shareholders right to dissent from the Merger under the URBCA, and shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided for by Part 13 of Title 16, Chapter 10a of the URBCA with respect to such Company Dissenters Shares. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Failure to Perfect_. If any Company Dissenting Shareholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to dissent, each share of Company Common Stock of such Company Dissenting Shareholder shall be deemed to be an Undesignated Share and shall be converted at Parents discretion into the right to receive the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration. 

  

 (c) _Notice_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any notice received from a Company shareholder desiring to exercise dissenters rights under the URBCA. The Company shall not, except with the Parents prior consent, make any payment or offer of payment with respect to such notice or waive any failure to take any action required to protect dissenters rights under the URBCA.

   ##### 

  

    

circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable

threatened litigation relating to the Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor
the Company Bank has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Benefit
Plan or Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction

Section 4043.33 or 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has been required to file information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed plan year. It is not reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased by application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither the Company nor the Company Bank has provided, nor is either required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current
value of the assets of such Pension Plan, and there has been no material
change in the financial condition of such Plan since the last day of the most
recent plan year. 

   

 (vi) Neither the Company nor the Company Bank has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit Plan. The Company and the Company Bank may amend or terminate any such Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder. 

   

 (vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or the Company Bank relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year.

Each of the Company and Parent agrees that, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto shall not, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Company Meeting and Parent Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of the Company and Parent further agrees that if such party shall become aware prior to the Effective Date of any information furnished by such party that would cause any of the statements in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, it shall promptly inform the other party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement. 

  

 (c) _Status_. Parent agrees to advise the Company, promptly after Parent receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent Parent is aware thereof, threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information. 

  

 6.04. _Press Releases_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and neither shall issue any such press release or make any such public statements without the prior consent of the other 

   ##### 

  

    

party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided, however,_ that a
party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after such
consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such
press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice
of outside counsel be required by law or the rules or regulations of Nasdaq.
The Company and Parent shall cooperate to develop all public announcement
materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by
the other party. 

  

 6.05. _Access; Information_. 

  

 (a) _Right to Access_. Each of the Company and Parent agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford the other party and the other partys officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives such access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties and personnel and to such other information as the other party may reasonably request and, during such period, each party shall, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, furnish the other party all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. 

  

 (b) _Right to Review_. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.05(a), prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Parents respective representatives shall have the right, subject to the notice provision set forth in Section 6.05(a), to conduct a review to determine (i) that the assets, books, records and operations of the Company are in satisfactory condition and will not in a material way have an adverse impact on Parent after consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the conditions to closing as provided hereunder. 

  

 (c) _Operating Issues_. The Company agrees that, subject to applicable laws, it shall cooperate in good faith with Parent on mutually agreed operating issues which the parties agree have priority. 

  

 (d) _Access_. Parent agrees that, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford the Company and its authorized representatives such access to Parents personnel as the Company may reasonably request. 

  

 (e) _Confidentiality_. Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.05 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of law, each party shall keep confidential, and shall cause its representatives to keep confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.05 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement) unless such information (i) was already known to such party, (ii) becomes available to such party from other sources not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the party to which such information pertains or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from 

   ##### 

  

    

publicly available sources. In the event that this Agreement is terminated or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be
consummated each party shall promptly cause all copies of documents or
extracts thereof containing information and data as to another party hereto to
be returned to the party which furnished the same. No investigation by any
party of the business and affairs of any other party shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
in this Agreement, or the conditions to any partys obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (f) _Exception to Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company, the Company Bank, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries (and each of their respective employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" of the transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to any such party relating to such "tax treatment" or "tax structure." For the purposes of this Section 6.05(f), "tax treatment" and "tax structure" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1.6011-4(c)(7) and (8) of the United States Treasury Regulations. 

   

 6.06. _Affiliates_. The Company shall cooperate with Parent to identify those Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act (such Persons being " _Company Affiliates_ "). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each Person so identified to deliver to Parent, prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, a written agreement (which agreement shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit C). Parent shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement or any other registration statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale of Parent Common Stock by such Company Affiliates received in the Merger. The certificates representing Parent Common Stock received by Company Affiliates shall bear a customary legend regarding applicable Securities Act restrictions and the provisions of this Section. 

  

 6.07. _Acquisition Proposals_. The Company agrees that neither the Company nor the Company Bank nor any of their respective officers or directors shall, and that it shall direct and use its best efforts to cause the Company Banks employees, agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction involving, or any purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or more than 10% of the outstanding equity securities of the Company (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "). The Company further agrees that neither the Company nor the Company Bank nor any of their respective officers or directors shall, and that it shall direct and use its best efforts to cause any of the Company Banks employees, agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (A) complying with its disclosure obligations under federal or state law; (B) providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board receives from the Person so requesting such 

   ##### 

  

    

information an executed confidentiality agreement; (C) engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal; or (D) recommending such an Acquisition
Proposal to the shareholders of the Company, if and only to the extent that,
(i) in each such case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D) above, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that such action is, in the absence of the foregoing
proscriptions, necessary in order for its directors to comply with their
respective fiduciary duties under applicable law and (ii) in the case
referred to in clause (D) above, the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Acquisition
Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal and would, if consummated, result in a transaction
more favorable to the Companys shareholders than the Merger. The Company
agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that it will
notify Parent promptly if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are
received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of
its representatives. 

  

 6.08. _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective Date, on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger. 

  

 6.09. _Regulatory Applications_. 

  

 (a) _Preparation and Filing_. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company shall provide to Parent all information necessary or otherwise reasonably requested in connection with such filings; and any initial filings with Governmental Authorities (other than the Registration Statement) shall be made by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution hereof but, provided that the Company has cooperated as described above, in no event later than 45 days after the date hereof; provided, however, that any request to the Federal Reserve Board for a waiver shall be made in accordance with the policies of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Each of Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it shall consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party shall keep the other parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Furnishing Information_. Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of the other party or any of its subsidiaries to any third party or Governmental Authority. 

  

 6.10. _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) _Coverage_. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company and the Company Bank (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " _)_ against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ " _)_ incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any related agreement, but excluding any Costs arising out of any violation or alleged violation of the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to insider trading) to the fullest extent that the Company is permitted to indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors or officers under the URBCA, the Company Articles and the Company By-Laws as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under the URBCA, the Company Articles and the Company By-Laws shall be made by independent counsel selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. 

  

 (b) _D andO Insurance_. For a period of three years from the Effective Time, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide that portion of directors and officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors (determined as of the Effective Time) of the Company (as opposed to the portion that serves to reimburse the Company) with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time, which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by the Company; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall Parent be required to expend on an annual basis more than 200% of the current amount expended on an annual basis by the Company (the " _Insurance Amount_ " _)_ to maintain or procure such directors and officers insurance coverage; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.10(b), Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that officers and directors of the Company may be required to make application and provide customary representations and warranties to Parents insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. 

  

 (c) _Notice and Procedure_. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.10(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, shall promptly notify Parent thereof; _provided_ that the failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under Section 6.10(a) unless and to the extent that Parent is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent shall 

   ##### 

  

    

have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be liable to
such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Parent shall elect not to assume such
defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises in writing that there
are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction promptly
as statements thereof are received, (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and _provided, further_ ,
that Parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party
when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement is not permitted or prohibited by applicable law. 

  

 (d) _Successors_. If Parent or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, Parent will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent will assume the obligations set forth in this Agreement that at that time have not yet been performed by Parent. 

  

 6.11. _Benefit Plans_. 

  

 (a) _Continuing Employees_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide former employees of the Company or the Company Bank who remain as employees of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries with pension and welfare benefits under employee benefit plans no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be. Parent shall cause each employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of Parent in which employees of the Company or the Company Bank are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder, except for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, service by employees of the Company and Parent Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall obligate Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to (i) maintain any particular Benefit Plan or (ii) retain the employment of any particular employee. 

  

 (b) _Transaction_. If employees of the Company or the Company Bank become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Parent, Parent shall cause, to the extent practicable, each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of the Company or the Company Bank, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on 

   ##### 

  

    

or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the
Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _Company Plans_. If Parent determines that one or more Benefit Plans of the Company or the Company Bank should be amended, modified or terminated prior to the Effective Time, the Company or the Company Bank, as the case may be, shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably requested by Parent to so amend, modify or terminate and, if reasonably necessary or appropriate, obtain applicable determination letters or other required approvals from the IRS and/or the Department of Labor, as appropriate, in connection with such action. 

  

 (d) _401(k) Plan_. Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Date, the Company shall terminate its 401(k) Plan unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plan shall not be terminated. If the Companys 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to the previous sentence, Parent will offer the plan participants an election to roll over their plan accounts into Parents 401(k) Plan, or the Companys 401(k) Plan may distribute its net assets to participants and beneficiaries in accordance with such 401(k) Plan and applicable laws. If the Companys 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.12(d), the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that its 401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the review and reasonable and timely approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating its 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require. 

  

 (e) _Stock Option Plan_. Employees of the Company and the Company Bank will also be entitled to participate in the employee stock option plan(s) of Parent and Parent Bank in the same manner as employees of Parent and Parent Bank. Employees of the Company and the Company Bank will be entitled to carry over unused vacation days and sick leave accrued as of the Effective Time consistent with guidelines applicable to employees of Parent and Parent Bank. 

  

 (f) _Change in Control Agreements_. As of the Effective time, Parent will assume and honor and cause Parent Bank to assume and honor in accordance with their terms any agreements of the Company or the Company Bank with respect to any benefits or payments triggered by a change of control of the Company or the Company Bank set forth in Section 6.11(f) of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _CIC Agreements_ "). Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Merger will constitute a merger, sale or a change of control of the Company and the Company Bank for all purposes under the CIC Agreements. The provisions of this Section 6.11(f) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each director, officer or employee that is a party to any such agreement. 

  

 6.12. _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements_. Each director of the Company except Brent Anderson and Mike Andersen shall, simultaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, execute and deliver to Parent a Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, and each of Brent Anderson and Mike 

   ##### 

  

    

Andersen shall, simultaneously with the execution and delivery hereof,
execute and deliver to Parent a mutually agreeable non-solicitation
agreement. 

  

 6.13. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. 

  

 6.14. _Human Resources Issues_. The Company agrees to cooperate with Parent with respect to any formal meetings or interviews with one or more employees called or arranged by the Company and held for the purpose of discussing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or their effect on such employees, with Parent given the opportunity to participate in such meetings or interviews. This Section is not intended to apply to casual conversations about the transaction or informal meetings initiated by employees, or to prohibit discussion in general, but rather to allow Parent a role in the formal presentation of the transaction to employees, and an opportunity to participate in significant, formal meetings at which the transaction is explained and discussed. Additionally, prior to making any written or oral communications to the directors, officers or employees of the Company or the Company Bank pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication. 

  

 6.15. _Assistance with Third-Party Agreements_. 

  

 (a) _Required Consents_. The Company shall cooperate with and use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in (i) gaining access to and obtaining any required consents from all of its third-party vendors, landlords of all of the Companys leased properties and other parties to material agreements, promptly after the date of this Agreement, and (ii) obtaining the cooperation of such third parties in a smooth transition in accordance with Parents timetable at or after the Effective Time of the Merger. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in minimizing the extent to which any information technology contracts (that Parent does not wish to continue) will continue in effect following the Effective Time of the Merger by paying any required exit fees, in addition to complying with the prohibition of Section 4.01(l) hereof. 

  

 (b) _Data Conversion_. Without limiting Section 6.15(a), the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to provide data processing and other processing support or outside contractors to assist Parent in performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion of the Companys and the Company Banks data and other files and records to Parents production environment, when requested by Parent and sufficient to ensure that a successful conversion can occur at such time as Parent requests on or after the Effective Time of the Merger. Among other things, the Company shall: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) cooperate with Parent to establish a mutually agreeable project plan to effectuate the conversion; 

   

 (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Companys and the Company Banks outside contractors continue to support both the conversion effort and their needs until the conversion can be established; 

   

 (iii) provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts requested by Parent for use in planning the conversion, as soon as reasonably practicable; 

   

 (iv) provide reasonable access to personnel at corporate headquarters, data and other processing centers, all branches and, with the consent of outside contractors, at outside contractors, to enable the conversion effort to be completed on schedule; and 

   

 (v) to the extent reasonably practicable, give notice of termination, conditioned upon the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, of the contracts of outside data and other processing contractors or other third-party vendors when directed to do so by Parent. 

 

Parent agrees that all actions taken pursuant to this Section 6.15 shall be
taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption to the customary business
activities of the Company. 

   

 6.16. _Bank Merger_. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Bank to, at the request of Parent (i) take all necessary corporate and other action, to adopt and approve the Bank Merger; (ii) execute, deliver and, where appropriate, file any and all agreements and other documents necessary or desirable to permit the Bank Merger at such time following consummation of the Merger as, in Parents sole discretion, is appropriate; and (iii) take and cause to be taken any other action to permit the consummation of any transactions contemplated in connection with the Bank Merger. The Company shall not, and shall not permit the Company Bank to, take any action that would prevent performance of the agreement of Bank Merger or any other transactions contemplated in connection with the Bank Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Parent Bank may at any time prior to the time the Bank Merger becomes effective change the method of effecting the combination of Parent Bank with the Company Bank if and to the extent Parent or Parent Bank deems such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of Merger Consideration to be issued to the holders of the Company Common Stock as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of the Companys shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration, including, without limitation, any adverse effect upon the tax-free treatment, (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) otherwise be materially prejudicial to the interests of the shareholders of the Company. Parent acknowledges that Parent intends to operate the Company Bank for the foreseeable future following the Merger as a division of Parent Bank operating in the State of Utah as "Far West Bank". 

  

 6.17. _Voting Agreements_. Each director of the Company, as a shareholder of Company Common Stock, shall execute and deliver to Parent simultaneously with the execution of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement a Voting Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto,
committing each such person, among other things, to vote his or her shares of
Company Common Stock in favor of the principal terms of the Merger at the
Company Meeting and to certain representations and covenants. 

  

 6.18. _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time of the Merger any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest Parent or Parent Bank with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of the Company and the Company Bank, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all necessary or appropriate action. 

  

 6.19. _Pre-Closing Adjustments_. At or before the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Bank to, make such accounting entries or adjustments, including additions to their ALLL and charge-offs of loans, as Parent shall direct as a result of its on-going review of the Company and the Company Bank (including its review of the information provided to it pursuant to Sections 6.05 and 6.14) or in order to implement its plans following the Effective Time or to reflect expenses and costs related to the Merger or made pursuant to Section 6.22; provided, however, that unless the adjustment would otherwise be required by applicable law, rule or regulation, or by regulatory accounting principles and GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the financial statements of the Company, (a) the Company shall not be required to take such actions more than one day prior to the Effective Time of the Merger or prior to the time Parent agrees in writing that all of the conditions to its obligation to close as set forth in Section 7.02 have been satisfied or waived and each of the approvals in Section 7.01(b) have been received, and (b) no such adjustment shall (i) require any filing with any Governmental Authority, (ii) violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to Parent, (iii) otherwise materially disadvantage the Company if the Merger was not consummated or (iv) constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. 

  

 6.20. _Tax Treatment of the Merger_. Parent and the Company intend that the Merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization qualifying under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of Parent and the Company will be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. Each party will (and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to) both before and after the Effective Time (i) use reasonable efforts to cause this Agreement to so qualify; (ii) refrain from taking any action that would reasonably be expected to cause this Agreement to fail to so qualify; and (iii) take the position for all purposes that this Agreement so qualifies. 

  

 6.21. _Preservation of Insurance Claims_. The Company will take, and will cause the Company Bank to take, all commercially reasonable action (including, without limitation, the making of claims and the giving of notices) pursuant to any of the insurance policies listed in Section 5.03(s) of the Disclosure Schedule in order to preserve all material rights thereunder with respect to all matters which could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim thereunder prior to the Effective Time, and in any event, upon the reasonable request of Parent. The Company will, and will cause the Company Bank to, provide Parent with proof of such claim or notice in a form satisfactory to Parent. 

    ##### 

 

   

 6.22. _Special Dividend_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section, and upon prior written notice to Parent of the Companys intention to do so, the Company may declare and pay, prior to the Closing Date, a special cash dividend per outstanding share of Company Common Stock, but only if, after giving effect to the payment of such special cash dividend, the Companys total consolidated stockholders equity shall not be less than $50,000,000. Satisfaction of the foregoing condition shall be demonstrated by the Companys delivery to Parent not more than twenty (20) nor less than ten (10) days prior to the anticipated Effective Time of a pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of the declaration date, reporting total consolidated stockholders equity of not less than $50,000,000, together with a year to date pro forma consolidated statement of income and a year to date pro forma consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity. The above-described pro forma financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information, consistently applied, giving effect to all accruals and adjustments reasonably considered necessary for a fair presentation including, without limitation, those adjustments anticipated to be made pursuant to Section 6.19; legal, investment banking, accounting and other professional fees; expenses and transaction costs incurred in connection with the Merger and the Bank Merger; all adjustments required to conform the ALLL to the methodology of Parent in accordance with GAAP (provided that consideration is given to any payoffs, paydowns, additional collateral and guarantees and updated financial information reasonably satisfactory to Parent and in any event such adjustments do not exceed $2.0 million); all contract termination costs; accrual of all contingent liabilities in accordance with SFAS No. 5 (provided that no accruals shall be required for any contingent liabilities associated with the repurchase of Company Common Stock by the Company); accrual of severance and retention benefits and related payroll tax liabilities; accrual for any airline mileage program (provided that such adjustments do not exceed $75,000); and accrual for payments to be made under supplemental compensation agreements or similar agreements as a result of the Merger or Bank Merger (with the amount of such accrual to be confirmed by Benmark), and accompanied by a written certification of the Parents independent public accounting firm to the effect that such firm has reviewed such financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, based thereon, that such firm is not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial statements for the financial statements to be in conformity with GAAP. Parent shall have five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Companys notice and the pro forma financial statements in which to object to the declaration and payment of the special cash dividend. In the event Parent does not object within such time period, the Company may declare and pay such special cash dividend, provided that the special cash dividend is paid prior to the Effective Time.

 _EXHIBIT A_  

   

VOTING AGREEMENT  

  

 This VOTING AGREEMENT ( _"Voting Agreement"_ ) is made and entered into as of October ___, 2006 by and between AmericanWest Bancorporation, a Washington corporation ( _"AmericanWest"_ ), and the signatory hereto ( _"Shareholder"_ ). 

  

 WHEREAS, AmericanWest and Far West Bancorporation, a Utah corporation ( _"Far West"_ ), have entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the _"Merger Agreement"_ ), pursuant to which Far West will be merged (the _"Merger"_ ) with and into AmericanWest, and Far West Bank, a Utah bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Far West ( _"Far West Bank"_ ), will be merged with and into AmericanWest Bank, a Washington banking corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AmericanWest ( _"AmericanWest Bank"_ ), and pursuant to which Shareholder will receive, for each share of Far West common stock ( _"Far West Common Stock"_ ) held, such consideration as set forth in the Merger Agreement for all of Shareholders shares of Far West Common Stock; and 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, AmericanWest has required that Shareholder, solely in Shareholders capacity as a Far West shareholder, enter into, and Shareholder has agreed to enter into, this Voting Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt, adequacy and sufficiency of which the parties hereby acknowledge by their execution hereof), the parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_ _._ Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to AmericanWest as follows: 

   

 (a) _Authority_ _._ Shareholder has all necessary power and authority to enter into this Voting Agreement and perform all of such Shareholders obligations hereunder. This Voting Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Shareholder (and Shareholders spouse, if the Shares (as defined below) constitute joint or community property) and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of and is enforceable against Shareholder, and Shareholders spouse, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (b) _Ownership of Shares_ _._ Shareholder is the beneficial owner or record holder of the number of shares of Far West Common Stock indicated under Shareholders name on the signature page hereto (the _"Existing Shares"_ , and together with any shares of Far West Common Stock acquired by Shareholder after the date hereof, the _"Shares"_ ) and, as of the date hereof, the Existing Shares constitute all the shares of Far West Common Stock owned of record or beneficially by Shareholder. With respect to the Existing Shares, subject to applicable community property laws, Shareholder has sole voting power and sole power to issue instructions with respect to the matters set forth in Section 2 hereof, sole power of disposition, sole power to demand appraisal rights and sole power to engage in actions set forth in Section 2 hereof, with no restrictions on the voting rights, rights of disposition or otherwise, subject to applicable laws and the terms of this Voting Agreement. 

   

 (c) _No Conflicts_ _._ Neither the execution and delivery of this Voting Agreement nor the performance by Shareholder of Shareholders obligations hereunder will conflict with or constitute a violation of or default under any contract, commitment, agreement, 

   ##### 

  

   

arrangement or restriction of any kind to which Shareholder is a party or by
which Shareholder or the Shares are bound. 

  

 2. _Voting Agreement and Agreement Not to Transfer_ _._  

   

 (a) _Voting_. Shareholder hereby agrees to vote all of the Shares held by Shareholder (i) in favor of the principal terms of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Far West under the Merger Agreement; and (iii) except with the prior written consent of AmericanWest, against the following actions (other than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement): (A) any extraordinary corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Far West or Far West Bank; (B) any sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of the assets of Far West or Far West Bank; (C) any change in the majority of the board of directors of Far West; (D) any material change in the present capitalization of Far West; (E) any amendment of Far Wests Articles of Incorporation or the equivalent organizational documents of Far West Bank; (F) any other material change in the corporate structure or business of Far West or Far West Bank; or (G) any other action which is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially adversely affect the contemplated economic benefits to AmericanWest of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Shareholder shall not enter into any agreement or understanding with any person or entity prior to the Termination Date (as defined below) to vote or give instructions after the Termination Date in any manner inconsistent with clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence. 

   

 (b) _Transfers_. Shareholder hereby agrees not to (i) sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any of his or her Shares without the prior written consent of AmericanWest, other than Shares sold or surrendered to pay the exercise price of any stock options or to pay taxes or satisfy Far Wests withholding obligations with respect to any taxes resulting from such exercise or (ii) pledge, mortgage or encumber such Shares. Any permitted transferee of Shares must become a party to this Voting Agreement and any purported transfer of Shares to a person or entity that has not become a party hereto shall be null and void. 

  

 3. _Cooperation_ _._ Shareholder agrees that he or she will not directly or indirectly solicit any inquiries or proposals from any person relating to any proposal or transaction for the disposition of the business or assets of Far West or Far West Bank or the acquisition of voting securities of Far West or Far West Bank or any business combination between Far West or Far West Bank and any person other than AmericanWest and AmericanWests affiliates. 

  

 4. _Shareholder Capacity_ _._ Shareholder is entering this Voting Agreement in his or her capacity as the record or beneficial owner of Shareholders Shares, and not in his or her capacity as a director of Far West or Far West Bank. Nothing in this Voting Agreement shall be deemed in any manner to limit the discretion of Shareholder to take any action, or fail to take any action, in his or her capacity as a director of Far West or Far West Bank, that may be required of Shareholder in the exercise of his or her duties and responsibilities as a director of Far West or Far West Bank. 

  

 5. _Termination_ _._ The obligations of Shareholder hereunder shall terminate upon the consummation of the Merger. If the Merger is not consummated, the obligations of Shareholder hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its 

   ##### 

  

 

terms; _provided_ that if, in the event of such termination, Far West is
required to pay AmericanWest a termination fee specified in Section 8.02 of
the Merger Agreement, those obligations set forth in Sections 2(a)(ii),
2(a)(iii)(G) and the last sentence of Section 2(a) hereof shall survive until
Far West pays the specified termination fee to AmericanWest. In addition, if
Far West is required to pay AmericanWest a termination fee specified in
Section 8.02 of the Merger Agreement, Far Wests payment of the termination
fee is the sole remedy for any breach of this Voting Agreement. The "
_Termination Date_ " for any particular provision hereunder shall be the
date of termination of Shareholders obligations for such provision. 

   

 6. _Specific Performance_ _._ Shareholder acknowledges that damages would be an inadequate remedy to AmericanWest for an actual or prospective breach of this Voting Agreement and that the obligations of Shareholder hereto shall be specifically enforceable. 

  

 7. _Liability_ _._ Notwithstanding any breach of this Voting Agreement by Shareholder, if the Merger is completed on substantially the same terms as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, no liability will accrue to Shareholder. 

  

 8. _Miscellaneous_ _._  

   

 (a) _Definitional Matters_ _._  

   

 (i) Unless the context otherwise requires, "person" shall mean a corporation, association, partnership, joint venture, organization, business, individual, trust, estate or any other entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act). 

   

 (ii) All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Voting Agreement shall have the respective meanings that the Merger Agreement ascribes to such terms. 

   

 (iii) The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Voting Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Entire Agreement_ _._ This Voting Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

   

 (c) _Parties in Interest_ _._ This Voting Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives. Nothing in this Voting Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Voting Agreement. 

   

 (d) _Assignment_ _._ This Voting Agreement shall not be assigned without the prior written consent of the other party hereto; provided, that AmericanWest may assign any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any of its affiliates. 

   

 (e) _Modifications_ _._ This Voting Agreement shall not be amended, altered or modified in any manner whatsoever, except by a written instrument executed by the parties hereto. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) _Severability_ _._ If any provision of this Voting Agreement or the application of such provision to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision or application shall be unenforceable only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, and the remainder of the provision held invalid or unenforceable and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances, other than the party as to which it is held invalid, and the remainder of this Voting Agreement, shall not be affected. 

   

 (g) _Governing Law_ _._ This Voting Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof. 

   

 (h) _Attorney s Fees_ _._ The prevailing party or parties in any litigation, arbitration, mediation, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding ( _"Proceeding"_ ) relating to the enforcement or interpretation of this Voting Agreement may recover from the unsuccessful party or parties all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel (including expert witness and other consultants fees and costs) relating to or arising out of (a) the Proceeding (whether or not it proceeds to judgment) and (b) any post judgment or post-award proceeding including, without limitation, one to enforce or collect any judgment or award resulting from the Proceeding. All such judgments and awards shall contain a specific provision for the recovery of all such subsequently incurred costs, expenses, and fees and disbursements of counsel. 

   

 (i) _Validity_ _._ The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Voting Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Voting Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. 

   

 (j) _Counterparts_ _._ This Voting Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts or facsimile counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

   

 (k) _Notices_ _._ Any notices or other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given upon (i) transmitters confirmation of a receipt of a facsimile transmission, (ii) confirmed delivery by a standard overnight carrier or (iii) the expiration of five business days after the day when mailed by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, addressed at the following addresses (or at such other address as the parties hereto shall specify by like notice):

 _EXHIBIT B_  

   

NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT  

  

 This NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of October ___, 2006, by and between ___(" _Director_ ") and AmericanWest Bancorporation, a Washington corporation (" _AmericanWest_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, Director is a director of Far West Bancorporation, a Utah corporation with its principal place of business in Provo, Utah (" _Far West_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, AmericanWest and Far West have proposed to enter into the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which (i) Far West will merge with and into AmericanWest, (ii) Far West Bank, a Utah bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Far West (" _Far West Bank_ "), will merge with and into AmericanWest Bank, a Washington banking corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AmericanWest (" _AmericanWest Bank_ "), and (iii) Director will receive such consideration as is set forth in the Merger Agreement for all of Directors shares of common stock of Far West; and 

  

 WHEREAS, in order to induce AmericanWest to enter into the Merger Agreement and to minimize the risk that AmericanWest will lose the benefit of the goodwill and other assets being acquired, Director has agreed to restrict his activities in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of and sufficiency of which the parties hereto hereby acknowledge, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality_. 

  

 (a) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement: 

    

 (i) " _Client_ " means any client or prospective client of the Company (as defined below) or its affiliates whose identity became known to Director in connection with his relationship with the Company or its affiliates; 

   

 (ii) "Company" means (i) Far West and Far West Bank prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and (ii) at and following the Effective Time " _Company_ " means AmericanWest and its affiliates; 

   

 (iii) " _Restricted Business_ " shall mean any activity closely and customarily associated with commercial banking or the operation of an institution the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (but for purposes of clarification and removal of doubt, Restricted Business shall not include investment banking (including bond issues supported by bank or other letters of credit), investment advisory, broker-dealer or similar investment activities); 

   

 (iv) "Restricted Territory" shall mean the geographic area consisting of the State of Utah; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) "Solicit" means any direct or indirect communication of any kind, regardless of who initiates it, that in any way invites, advises, encourages or requests any person to take or refrain from taking any action. 

  

 (b) _Agreement_. Director agrees that for the period commencing on the Effective Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and ending on the date that is the 24-month anniversary of the Effective Date, Director shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in or have any ownership interest in, or participate in the financing, operation, management or control of, any person, firm, corporation or other entity or business that engages in a Restricted Business in the Restricted Territory; provided, that this provision shall not prohibit Director from owning bonds, preferred stock or up to five percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of any such entity if such common stock is publicly traded. 

   

 (c) _No Solicitation_. Director further agrees that he shall not, directly or indirectly, during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the date that is the 24-month anniversary of the Effective Date, nor shall he cause or induce any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity to: (i) solicit any Client for any purpose with respect to a Restricted Business or Solicit any Client to reduce or refrain from doing any business with the Company or its affiliates, (ii) transact business with any Client that would cause Director to be engaged in a Restricted Business with such Client in a Restricted Territory, (iii) interfere with or damage any relationship between the Company or its affiliates and a Client or (iv) Solicit anyone who is then an employee of the Company or its affiliates (or who was an employee of the Company or its affiliates within the prior 12 months) to resign from the Company or its affiliates or to apply for or accept employment with, or to act as an agent, consultant, independent contractor or partner in, any other business or enterprise. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to prohibit general advertising or solicitation not directed at any or all of the Clients or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates. For purposes of subsection (iv) of this Section 1(c), Director shall not be prohibited from soliciting any former employees of the Company or its affiliates who have been terminated by the Company or one of its affiliates. 

   

 (d) _Confidentiality_. Director hereby acknowledges that, as a director of Far West and/or Far West Bank, he makes use of, acquires and adds to confidential information of a special and unique nature and value relating to Far West and Far West Bank and their respective strategic plans and financial operations (such information, the " _Confidential Information_ "). Director further recognizes and acknowledges that all Confidential Information is the exclusive property of Far West or Far West Bank, as the case may be, is material and confidential, and is critical to the successful conduct of the business of Far West or Far West Bank, as the case may be. Accordingly, Director hereby covenants and agrees that he will use Confidential Information for the benefit of the Company only and shall not at any time, directly or indirectly, during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, divulge, reveal or communicate any Confidential Information to any person, firm, corporation or entity whatsoever, or use any Confidential Information for his own benefit or for the benefit of others. 

   

 (e) _Separate Covenants_. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants (or any part thereof) contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 1, then such unenforceable covenants (or such part) shall be deemed eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) _Reformation_. In the event that the provisions of this Section 1 should ever be deemed to exceed the duration or geographic limitations or scope permitted by applicable law, then such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations or scope, as the case may be, permitted by applicable laws. 

   

 (g) _Specific Performance_. Director acknowledges that it would be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any breach of any of the provisions of this Section 1 and that the remedy at law for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would likely be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that AmericanWest shall, in addition to any other rights or remedies which it may have, be entitled to seek such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain Director from violating any of such provisions of this Agreement. In connection with any action or proceeding for injunctive relief, Director hereby waives the claim or defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to have each such provision of this Section 1 specifically enforced against Director, without the necessity of posting bond or other security against Director, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief against Director enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such provisions of this Section 1. 

   

 (h) _Survival_. Any termination of Directors employment or of this Agreement (or breach of this Agreement by Director or AmericanWest) shall have no effect on the continuing operation of this Section 1. 

   

 2. _Miscellaneous_. 

  

 (a) _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by a written instrument signed by authorized representatives of both parties and referring specifically to this Agreement. No waiver of any breach or default hereunder shall be considered valid unless in writing and signed by the party giving such waiver, and no such waiver shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or similar nature. 

   

 (b) _Counterparts_. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts or facsimile counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same agreement. 

   

 (c) _Attorney s Fees_. The prevailing party or parties in any litigation, arbitration, mediation, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding (" _Proceeding_ ") relating to the enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement may recover from the unsuccessful party or parties all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel (including expert witness and other consultants fees and costs) relating to or arising out of (a) the Proceeding (whether or not it proceeds to judgment) and (b) any post judgment or post-award proceeding including, without limitation, one to enforce or collect any judgment or award resulting from the Proceeding. All such judgments and awards shall contain a specific provision for the recovery of all such subsequently incurred costs, expenses, and fees and disbursements of counsel. 

   

 (d) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof. 

   

 (e) _Jurisdiction_. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the Merger Agreement may be brought in the courts of the State of Utah or of the United States of 

    ##### 

  

    

America for the District of Utah and, by execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each of Director and AmericanWest hereby accepts for himself and
itself and in respect of his or its property, generally and unconditionally,
the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of Director and AmericanWest
irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of
the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the delivery of
notice as provided in Section 2(f) below, such service to become effective 30
days after such delivery. 

   

 (f) _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered personally or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid or next-day courier:

 (h) _Captions_. The section and paragraph captions herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. 

   

 3. _Term of Agreement; Termination_.

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Far West Bancorporation, a Utah corporation (the _"Company"_ ), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 ("Rule 145") of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October ___, 2006 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between AmericanWest Bancorporation (" _AmericanWest_ ") and the Company, the Company will be merged into AmericanWest (the " _Merger_ "), and that as a result of the Merger, I may be eligible to receive shares of common stock of AmericanWest (" _AmericanWest Common Stock_ ") in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) owned by me. 

  

 I hereby represent, warrant and covenant to AmericanWest that in the event I receive any AmericanWest Common Stock pursuant to the Merger: 

  

 1. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the AmericanWest Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations. 

  

 2. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of AmericanWest Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or with counsel for the Company. 

  

 3. I have been advised that any issuance of AmericanWest Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger Agreement has been registered with the SEC on a registration statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted to the shareholders of the Company for approval I may be an "affiliate" of the Company, any sale or disposition by me of any of the AmericanWest Common Stock may only be made, under current law, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Act, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or pursuant to an exemption thereunder. I agree that I will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of AmericanWest Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act; (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 144 promulgated by the SEC under the Act; or (iii) in the written opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to AmericanWest, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act. 

  

 4. I understand that AmericanWest is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the AmericanWest Common Stock by me or on my behalf or to 

   ##### 

  

 

take any other action necessary to make compliance with an exemption from
registration available. 

   

 5. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to AmericanWests transfer agent with respect to AmericanWest Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for the AmericanWest Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

   

"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies and may be sold or otherwise transferred only in compliance with the
requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under said
act or an exemption from such registration." 

  

 6. I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my AmericanWest Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, AmericanWest reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: 

   

"The sale of the shares represented by this certificate has not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), and the shares were acquired from a person who received such shares in
a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act applies.
The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except
in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act." 

  

 It is understood and agreed that this letter agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect and the legends set forth in paragraphs (5) or (6) above, as the case may be, shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and the related stop transfer of restrictions shall be lifted forthwith, if (i) any such shares of AmericanWest Common Stock shall have been registered under the Act for sale, transfer or other disposition by me or on my behalf and are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or (ii) any such shares of AmericanWest Common Stock are sold in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), (f) and (g) of Rule 144 promulgated under the Act, or (iii) I am not at the time an affiliate of AmericanWest and have been the beneficial owner of the AmericanWest Common Stock for at least one year (or such other period as may be prescribed by the Act and the Rules and Regulations), and AmericanWest has filed with the SEC all of the reports it is required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the preceding 12 months, or (iv) I am not and have not been for at least three months an affiliate of AmericanWest and have been the beneficial owner of the AmericanWest Common Stock for at least two years (or such other period as may be prescribed by the Act and the Rules and Regulations), or (v) AmericanWest shall have received a letter from the Staff of the SEC, or a written opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to AmericanWest, to the effect that the stock transfer restrictions and the legend are not required.
