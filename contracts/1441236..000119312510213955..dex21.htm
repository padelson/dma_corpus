iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 15, 2010 (the "
_Agreement_ "), by and among Clearwater Paper Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Sand Dollar Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "),
and Cellu Tissue Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").
All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the respective
meanings ascribed thereto in _Section 9.14_.

 

WHEREAS, the Company Board, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a
committee of the Company Board (the " _Transaction Committee of the Board of
Directors_ "), and the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub
have each unanimously approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, and
have approved and declared advisable this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the
stockholder parties named therein (the " _Stockholder Parties_ ") have
entered into the agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Voting
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms thereof, the
Stockholder Parties have agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of
Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement;
and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and to prescribe certain conditions
to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company. The
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with
all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at
the offices of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, 50 Fremont Street, San
Francisco, CA, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto, at 8:00 a.m., local time, on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ")
specified by the parties, which date shall be no later than two (2) Business
Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the
latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than
those conditions that relate to action to be taken at the Closing, but subject
to the



 

1  satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), unless this Agreement has been
theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless extended by mutual
written agreement of the parties. As soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , the
Merger shall become effective upon the filing with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware of a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "), and the parties shall take all reasonable further actions as may
be required by the DGCL to make the Merger effective. The term " _Effective
Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set
forth in the Certificate of Merger.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the appropriate
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and be
subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities and duties, of the Company
and Merger Sub, as provided under Section 259 of the DGCL.

 

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated in its
entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto and as so amended shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable Law (the "
_Surviving Corporation Charter_ "). From and after the Effective Time, the
Bylaws, as amended, of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated in their entirety as set
forth in _Exhibit C_ hereto, and as so amended shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided therein and in
accordance with applicable Law (the " _Surviving Corporation Bylaws_ ").

1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, until their successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Surviving Corporation Charter and the Surviving Corporation Bylaws.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company at the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their
successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Corporation Charter and the Surviving Corporation Bylaws.



 

2 ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON COMPANY

 

CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any party hereto or of the
holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or the holder of any
share of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by the Company (whether held in treasury or otherwise) or by any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, and any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent or Merger Sub or by any of their respective Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.2_ and
_Section 2.4_, each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive $12.00 per share, payable to the holder
thereof in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and
after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ " and
collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry share (each, a " _Book-
Entry Share_ " and collectively, the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") representing
any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section
2.2_.

(d) _Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock_.

(i) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the Company prior to
the Effective Time, immediately prior to the Effective Time, all Company
Stock Options, whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled by the
Company and shall no longer be outstanding thereafter. In consideration for
such cancellation, the holder thereof shall thereupon be entitled to receive,
at the Effective Time, a cash payment, without interest, from the Company in
respect of such cancellation in an amount (if any) equal to the product of (x)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option, whether or not then exercisable, and (y) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option.

 



 

3 (ii) All cash payments to holders of Company Stock Options and vesting
of Company Restricted Stock shall be treated as compensation and shall be net
of any applicable federal, state, foreign or other withholding Tax.

 

(iii) Any right of repurchase, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any
restricted stock agreement outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall lapse and any vesting thereon shall fully accelerate, in each case,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(iv) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that may be necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.1(d)_.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_. The procedures for
exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration
are as follows:

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) designate,
or cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a
paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares entitled
thereto. On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds in an amount sufficient to make the
payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(c)_ in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_ (such funds, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make all such payments, Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the
Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of
funds required to make such payments, and Parent and Surviving Corporation
shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Paying Agent shall make
payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance
with this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event
later than five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to  _Section
2.2(g)_ hereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Book-Entry
Shares) as Parent and the Company may mutually agree or the Paying Agent may
reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for effecting the

 



 

4  surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate together with such
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required pursuant to such instructions or receipt of an "agents message" with
respect to a Book-Entry Share, the holder of such Certificate or such Book-
Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash equal to
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificate or such Book-Entry Share,
and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of Company, payment may be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate or such Book-
Entry Share is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or receipt of an "agents message" with
respect to Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, and from and after the Effective Time the stock transfer
books of Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this Agreement, except as otherwise provided by Law.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any holder of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share (other than
Dissenting Shares) who has not previously complied with this _Section 2.2_
prior to the end of such twelve (12) month period shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration upon
compliance with the instructions in the form of letter of transmittal referred
to in _Section 2.2(b)_, without any interest thereon.

 

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or any
of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any Person in respect of
Merger

 



 

5  Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to the requirements of
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange
Fund as reasonably directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors, respectively, in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be placed in the
Exchange Fund and be payable to Parent.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

2.3 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held of
record by Company Stockholders who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(the " _Appraisal Rights Provisions_ "), (i) have not voted in favor of
adopting this Agreement, (ii) shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such shares, (iii) have otherwise complied in all respects with
the Appraisal Rights Provisions, and (iv) have not effectively withdrawn,
lost or failed to perfect their rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting
Stockholders_ "), will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive only those rights
provided under the Appraisal Rights Provisions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
all shares or former shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares or former
shares of Company Common Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall
thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
relating thereto, without interest, in the manner provided in _Sections
2.1(c)_ and subject to _Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.4_.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt written notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations

  

 

6  and proceedings with respect to such demands subject, prior to the Effective
Time, to consultation with the Company. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle or negotiate, any such demands.

2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Merger Consideration or consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of a Certificate, a Book-Entry Share, Company
Restricted Stock or a Company Stock Option, as the case may be, such amounts
as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable
provision of Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to
the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such deducted,
withheld and remitted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in (a) the Company SEC Reports filed by the Company on the
SECs Edgar system on or after January 1, 2009 and prior to the date hereof
(but only to the extent a particular disclosure therein is disclosed in such a
way that it is readily apparent based on the substance of such disclosure that
such disclosure is applicable to any representation and warranty contained in
_Article III_ of this Agreement, and excluding any exhibits thereto and any
disclosures therein under the caption "Risk Factors," and any other
disclosures therein of risks that are predictive or forward-looking in
nature) or (b) the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent on
the date hereof (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Section numbers
of which are numbered to correspond to the Section numbers of this Agreement
to which they refer (provided, however, that (i) an item disclosed in any
Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have been
disclosed for each other Section of this Agreement to the extent the relevance
of such disclosure to such other Section of this Agreement is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item
in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
constitutes a Company Material Adverse Effect), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except 



 

7  where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company, copies of
which have previously been made available to Parent and Merger Sub, are true,
correct, and complete copies of such documents as currently in effect.

 

(b) _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
the Subsidiaries of the Company, and for each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, sets forth its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.
Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is directly or indirectly wholly-owned by
the Company. All the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of each Subsidiary of the Company have been validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassesable and are owned by the Company, directly or
indirectly, free and clear of all Encumbrances. Except for its interests in
the Subsidiaries of the Company, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest,
joint venture interest or other equity interest in any Person. Neither the
Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, has any obligation to make any capital
contributions, or otherwise provide assets or cash to any Person. Each of the
Companys Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability
company, as applicable, duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or

of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, is or may be subject to Tax in that

Tax shelter within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6111-2, nor
has any Tax

 



 

15  item or any Tax strategy that has been derived from or related to any such
transaction been reflected in any Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries will be required to include in income, or exclude any item of
deduction from, Taxable income for any Taxable period (or portion thereof)

described in Code Section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local or foreign income Tax Law); (ii) intercompany transactions

Affiliate has ever within the last six (6) years contributed or had an
obligation to contribute to any such plan. Each of the Company Pension Plans
that is intended to be a qualified plan within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination and/or opinion letter from
the IRS which was issued within the current remedial amendment period (or for
which a timely request is currently pending with the IRS) and, to the
Companys Knowledge, nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to
cause the loss or denial of such tax-favored status.

 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries provides or has agreed to
provide health or any other non-pension coverage or benefits to any Company



 

18  Personnel after his/her employment is terminated (other than as required by
Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or state health continuation Laws).

 

(g) No lawsuits, governmental administrative proceedings or written claims
(other than routine claims for benefits) to, or by, any Person or
Governmental Authority have been filed, are pending, or to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened with respect to any Company Plan concerning any matter
that would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability
to Parent (after the Effective Time), the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or any
Company Plan. There is no written correspondence between the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any other ERISA Affiliate, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority, on the other hand, related to any Company Plan
concerning any matter that would reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability to Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
Company Plan.

 

(h) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will, either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events, constitute an
event that will or may result in any payment, acceleration of payment,
forgiveness of Indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits
or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company Personnel.

(i) There is no voluntary employees beneficiary association within the
meaning of Sections 501(c)(9) and 505 of the Code maintained with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan. No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiple employer
welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. No Company
Benefit Plan that provides post-retirement medical coverage has unfunded
material liabilities that will not be offset by insurance or accrued on the
Company Balance Sheet.

representation proceeding seeking to compel, require or demand it to
bargain with any labor union or labor organization nor is there pending or

of its Subsidiaries. To the Companys Knowledge, neither the Company nor any
of its

Persons employed by or otherwise performing services primarily for the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default), in
each case, on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under the Commitment Letter or,
to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, any of the Financing Sources, and
(ii) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Section 7.1_

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

6.1 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any
event within twenty-five (25) Business Days after the date hereof, unless
Parent otherwise consents to an extension, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to the Company
Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company agrees that, assuming
Parents compliance with the last sentence of this  _Section 6.1(a)_, at the
date of mailing to the Company Stockholders and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act, and (ii) none of
the information supplied by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstance under which they were made, not
misleading. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company all 



 

31  information reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of the
Proxy Statement, and each of Parent and Merger Sub agree that, at the date of
mailing to the Company Stockholders and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, none of the information supplied by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will contain any untrue statements of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

 

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement, or for other information, shall consult
with Parent and Merger Sub prior to responding to any such comments or
requests or filing any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, and
shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives on the one hand and the SEC and its staff
on the other hand. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after
filing and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders
as promptly as practicable following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by
the SEC (or expiration of the applicable period for comments). If any party
hereto becomes aware of any information that, pursuant to the Exchange Act,
should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, then
the party that discovers such information shall promptly inform the other
parties hereto and the Company shall file an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information with the SEC and, if required by Law,
disseminate such amendment or supplement to the Company Stockholders.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing and
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent and its Representatives a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such Proxy Statement or response and shall discuss
with Parent and include in such Proxy Statement or response, comments
reasonably and promptly proposed by Parent and its Representatives.

 

6.2 _Company Stockholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance
with applicable Law and the Companys Organizational Documents, the Company
shall call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting
as soon as reasonably practicable following clearance of the Proxy Statement
by the SEC (and on a date selected by the Company in consultation with
Parent) for the purpose of the Company Stockholders considering and voting on
a proposal to adopt and approve this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company
may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) with the
consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a



 

32  quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing
of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board reasonably
determines is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company Stockholders
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting or (iv) if the Company has provided
a written notice to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 6.4(c)(iii)_
hereof and the deadline contemplated by _Sections 6.4(c)(iii)_ - _(v)_ with
respect to such notice has not expired. The foregoing sentence
notwithstanding, if on a date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, the Company may make one or more successive postponements
or adjournments of the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that the
Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is
later than the earlier of (x) the date that is thirty (30) days after the
date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled and
(y) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.4_, the Company Board shall recommend that the
Company Stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement (the " _Company
Recommendation_ ") and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit such approval and adoption by the Company Stockholders, including
inclusion of the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to and in accordance with _Article VIII_ , this Agreement
shall be submitted to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Stockholders Approval. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other
than procedural matters) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

6.3  _Third Party Consents and Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto
will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate the Merger as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing, in
consultation with the other party and as promptly as practicable and advisable
after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, and filings and to obtain as promptly as
reasonably practicable all consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, Orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations necessary to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in order to consummate
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain all such consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, Orders,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees (A) to make or cause
to be made, in consultation and cooperation with the other and as promptly as
practicable and



 

33  advisable after the date hereof but in any event no later than seven (7)
days after the date hereof, (y) any necessary filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and (z) all other necessary
registrations, declarations, notices and filings relating to the Merger with
other Governmental Authorities under any other Regulatory Law with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) to respond to any inquiries
received and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and any
other Regulatory Law and (C) to take all other actions reasonably necessary
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act and any other Regulatory Law as soon as practicable and not extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law or enter
into any agreement with a Governmental Authority not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written
consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(b) To the extent permissible under applicable Law, each of the parties hereto
shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 6.3(a)_ to
obtain all requisite approvals, clearances and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Regulatory Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Authority and of
any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other party, or the other partys legal
counsel, to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each
other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any
such other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, (iv) give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences to the
extent allowed by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority,
(v) in the event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Authority from participating in or attending any
meetings or conferences, keep the other promptly and reasonably apprised with
respect thereto and (vi) cooperate in the filing of any memoranda, white
papers, filings, correspondence, or other written communications explaining or
defending the transactions contemplated hereby, articulating any regulatory or
competitive argument, and/or responding to requests or objections made by any
Governmental Authority. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this _Section 6.3_ as "Antitrust Counsel
Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel. Parent shall pay any and all filing fees in connection with any
filings made under this  _Section 6.3_.



 

34 (c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law or if any Action,
whether judicial or administrative, is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any
of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i)
oppose or defend against any Action to prevent or enjoin consummation of this
Agreement (and the transactions contemplated herein); and/or (ii) take such
action as reasonably necessary to overturn any action by any Government
Authority or private party to block consummation of this Agreement (and the
transactions contemplated herein), including by defending any Action brought
by any Governmental Authority or private party in order to avoid entry of, or
to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary,
any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing
or the other transactions contemplated herein, or in order to resolve any such
objections or challenge as such Governmental Authority or private party may
have to such transactions under such Regulatory Law so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.3_ or
otherwise in this Agreement shall require or be deemed to require Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to agree to or take any action that constitutes or
would result in any Burdensome Condition. For purposes of this Agreement, a "
_Burdensome Condition_ " shall mean executing or carrying out agreements,
submitting to Orders (including consent decrees) or taking any other action
(i) providing for the license, sale or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of trust or otherwise) of any assets or business or
categories of assets or businesses of the Company, Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries or the holding separate of the capital stock of a Subsidiary of
Parent (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or the
Company, or (ii) imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability
of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to conduct
their respective businesses (including with respect to market practices and
structure) or own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of
ownership of the business of Parent, the Company or their Subsidiaries that,
in the case of (i) and (ii), individually or in the aggregate, would or would
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, assets,
liabilities, financial condition, operations or results of operations
(with materiality, for purposes of this provision, being measured in relation
to the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, operations and
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent.

6.4 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.4_, the Company agrees
that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or their
respective Representatives shall directly or indirectly through another Person
(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or
the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal, or

 



 

35  provide any information or data to any Person relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person access to the business,
properties, assets or personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with, or otherwise cooperate with any Person with respect to, an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into any acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar definitive agreement, letter of intent or agreement in
principle with respect thereto or any other agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement executed under the circumstances
described in _Section 6.4(b)_) relating to an Acquisition Proposal (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries and
its or their respective Representatives shall immediately cease all
discussions and negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, and deliver a written notice to each such Person
to the effect that the Company is ending discussions and negotiations with
such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and the notice shall
also request such Person to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries. Subject to this
_Section 6.4_, the Company shall not terminate, waive, amend or modify any
material provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it
is a party that relates to a transaction of a type described in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ¸ that the Company may permit
to be taken any of the actions prohibited under a standstill agreement if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal
advisors, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.4_ by any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 6.4_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.4(a)_,
at any time prior to the time the Company Stockholders Approval is obtained,
if the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any
Person (which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach of
this _Section 6.4_), (x) the Company may send a written communication to such
Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, asking such
Person to clarify specified terms and conditions thereof, (y) the Company and
its Representatives may provide information in response to a request therefor
by such Person if the Company receives from such Person (or has received from
such Person) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_
that all such information has previously been made available to Parent or is
provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such Person, and (z) the Company and its Representatives may
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person, in
the case of clauses (y) and (z), if and to the extent that prior to taking any
action (i) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith based on the information then
available and after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

 



 

36 (c) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.4(c)_, the Company Board shall
not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger or fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any of the foregoing, a "
_Change of Recommendation_ "), or adopt, approve or recommend or otherwise
declare advisable (publicly or otherwise), or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend (publicly or otherwise), an Acquisition Proposal, or cause or
permit the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time the Company Stockholders Approval is obtained, the Company Board
may (x) if an event, fact, development, circumstance or occurrence unrelated
to an Acquisition Proposal that affects the business, assets or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries that was not known to the Company as of the
date hereof (or, if known, the consequences of which are not known to or
reasonably foreseen by the Company Board as of the date hereof) becomes known
by the Company Board after the date hereof and prior to the time that the
Company Stockholders Approval is obtained, effect a Change of Recommendation,
or (y) if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
concludes in good faith after consultation with an outside financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, approve or
recommend such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 8.1(h)_, and in the case of either of clause (x) or (y), if,
and only if:

(i) the Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach by the
Company of this  _Section 6.4_;

(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law;

 

(iii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and
Merger Sub, at least three (3) Business Days in advance, that it will effect
a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(h)_, as applicable, which notice shall specify the basis for the Change of
Recommendation or termination and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, the material terms
thereof and the most current drafts of any agreements or other term sheets
relating thereto;

 

(iv) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation or taking action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(h)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and
Merger Sub desire to negotiate) during such three (3) Business Day period to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the Company Board not to effect a Change of Recommendation or take
action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(h)_; and



 

37 (v) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement that may be offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 PM
Eastern time on the third Business Day of such three (3) Business Day period
in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company and,
in the case of a Superior Proposal, shall have determined that the Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were
to be given effect; _provided_ that in the event of any material revisions to
the Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined to be a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.4_
(including  _Section 6.4(c)_) with respect to such new written notice.

(d) Nothing in this  _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company
or the Company Board or any committee thereof from complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), or making any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
Company Stockholders), _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than a
"stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed for all
purposes of this Agreement to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Company
Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such
communications.

(e) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within
two (2) days) notify Parent in writing if any proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for information or inquiry
that could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal are
received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any
of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making such offer, proposal,
request or inquiry, the material terms and conditions of any proposals,
offers, requests or inquiries, and including with such notice, copies of any
written proposal, or offer, request or other communication, and thereafter
the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current
basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers requests or
inquiries (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Companys intentions
as previously notified and promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide
Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies of all documents and other written
communications relating to any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry
exchanged between the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person or group making an
Acquisition Proposal or any of their Affiliates, or their respective
Representatives, on the other hand.



 

38 6.5 _Access to Information; Notice_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the Effective
Time or (ii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, afford to the Representatives of Parent, reasonable access during normal
business hours to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records upon reasonable prior notice. The Company also shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to (x) provide Parent with such access to the
appropriate individuals (including management personnel,
attorneys, accountants and other professionals) for discussion of the
Companys business, properties, prospects and personnel as Parent or Merger
Sub may reasonably request, and (y) furnish or cause to be furnished such
information concerning the business, properties, operations and other aspects
of the Company and it Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may
reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to violate or
result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work product
privilege. The parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Nothing in this _Section
6.5(a)_ shall expand or limit the obligations of the Company to provide
information pursuant to _Section 6.12_.

 

(b) With respect to all information furnished by one party to the other party
or its Representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall comply with,
and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their
respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time,
or the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide notice of:

 

(i) any material breach of any covenant or obligation of the notifying party
under this Agreement; and

 

(ii) the discovery by the notifying party of any event, condition, fact or
circumstance that would cause any representation or warranty made by such
party in this Agreement to be untrue such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.3(a)_ would not be satisfied.

 

(d) No information received by a party pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ or
otherwise shall operate as a waiver with respect to or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made or given by any other
party in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered in connection herewith.

 

(e) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_,
the



 

39  Company shall promptly provide notice to Parent of the commencement of any
material Action against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or related to
the Companys or its Subsidiaries business.

6.6 _Employment and Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date
that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Parent agrees to cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide base salary or standard hourly wage rate
for each Company Personnel, excluding any employee covered by a collective
bargaining agreement or otherwise represented by a labor organization, who
remain employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates after
the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") which is no less
than his or her base salary or standard hourly wage rate as in effect on the
Closing Date, and to provide to Company Employees bonus opportunities that are
no less favorable than the bonus opportunities provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and benefits that are in the aggregate no less
favorable than the benefits in effect under the Company Plans on the date
hereof. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and
cause the applicable benefit plans in which Company Employees are entitled to
participate to treat, the service of Company Employees with the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company attributable to any period before the Closing
Date as service rendered to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of Parent for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting,
vacation, paid time off, seniority rights and applicability of minimum waiting
periods for participation; provided, however, such service shall be excluded
for purposes of benefit accrual (including minimum pension
amount), eligibility for early retirement under any defined benefit pension
plan of Parent, eligibility for retiree welfare benefit plans, or as would
otherwise result in a duplication of coverage or benefits; and provided
further, nothing herein shall obligate Parent or Surviving Corporation to
provide coverage under a defined benefit pension plan to any Company
Personnel. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical
examinations under any health plan of Parent to be waived with respect to
Company Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived or
satisfied under the corresponding plan in which Company Employees
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date and any deductibles paid
by Company Employees under any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries health
plans in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be credited
towards deductibles under the health plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent for such plan year. Company Employees shall be considered to be
employed by the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates "at will" and nothing
shall be construed to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates to terminate the employment of any such
Company Employee at any time.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.6(a)_ hereof, Parent shall have sole discretion
with respect to the determination as to whether or when to terminate, merge
or continue any employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements of the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall continue to maintain such
employee benefit plans and programs of the Company (other than stock based
plans) until the Company Employees



 

40  are permitted to participate in the plans and programs of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with _Section 6.6(a)_.

 

(c) The Company and its Affiliates, as applicable, each agree to terminate any
and all plan(s) established or maintained pursuant to Code Section 401(k) for
employees, unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to
sponsor and maintain such plan(s) by providing the Company with written notice
of such election at least ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company and Parent mutually agree that
the termination of any such Code Section 401(k) plan in conjunction with the
replacement of a 401(k) plan would violate the terms of a collective
bargaining agreement, then such Code Section 401(k) plan shall not be
terminated. Unless Parent provides such notice to the Company, Parent shall
receive from the Company evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and
each Affiliate (as applicable) have been terminated; such evidence shall
include (i) resolutions of each such entitys Board of Directors (the form and
substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Parent) effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, (ii)
such other requirements as set forth in the plan document, and (iii) such
other actions as would be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the 401(k)
plan termination. If a Code Section 401(k) plan is terminated in accordance
with this provision, then the employees who are eligible to participate in
such plan will be offered the opportunity to commence participation in a
Parent 401(k) plan as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing
Date subject to the terms and conditions under such Parent 401(k) plan and the
terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.

 

(d) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, severance
benefits no less favorable than the benefits provided under the group
severance plan maintained by the Company and disclosed on _Section 3.13(c)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, for those participants covered under such
plan as of the Closing Date. The Company has made available to Parent a true,
complete and correct list of all eligible participants under the group
severance plan as of the date hereof and will update such list to
accurately reflect all eligible participants as of the Closing Date.

(e) Except with respect to any employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement or otherwise represented by a labor organization, or as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to be obligated to perform, in
accordance with their terms, all contractual rights of current and former
employees of the Company, or obligations of the Company under any change-in-
control plan, policy, or agreement maintained by the Company disclosed in
_Section 6.6(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Change-in-
Control Arrangements_ "). For purposes of the Change-in-Control Arrangements,
Parent acknowledges that the Merger will constitute a "change-in-control" and
a "change of control" of the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that the executive officers and directors and, as
applicable, employees of the Company shall be entitled to the applicable
payments and benefits as set forth in such Change-in-Control Arrangements in
accordance with the terms thereof. Notwithstanding



 

41  the foregoing, however, no executive officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement or shall otherwise have any rights to enforce the covenants
contained herein.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, nothing herein is
intended to or shall be construed to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Plan or to affect the Companys or Parents ability to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Plan. Nothing herein is intended to or shall be
construed to require the Company or Parent to continue the employment of any
Company Employee and each Company Employee may be terminated by the Company or
Parent or either of their Affiliates after the Closing Date for any reason or
no reason.

 

(g) With respect to all employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement
or otherwise represented by a labor organization, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation make no commitments and shall retain all legal rights available
under federal labor Laws.

 

6.7 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, each present and former director and
officer of the Company (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, Action, litigation, audit, investigation, arbitration, suit in equity
or at Law, administrative, regulatory or quasi-judicial proceeding, or other
proceeding of whatever kind or character before a Governmental Authority,
arbitrator, mediator or similar body, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties
service as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
services performed by such persons at the request of the Company or its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) actions to enforce or interpret this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party. The Surviving
Corporation shall also advance costs and expenses (including attorneys fees)
as incurred by any Indemnified Party within ten (10) days after receipt by the
Surviving Corporation of a written request for such advance to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification (it
being understood and agreed that the Surviving Corporation shall not require
the posting of any bond or any other security for such undertaking).

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall obtain and fully pay the premium
for the extension of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of
the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing directors and officers
insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies, in each case for a claims



 

42  reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions,
coverage limits and limits of liability that are not materially less favorable
than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies in effect on
the date hereof with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If Parent for
any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as
of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best
efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any such
policies pursuant to this  _Section 6.7(b)_ an annual premium or extension
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums paid by the Company
for such insurance as of the date hereof (which such amount is set forth on
_Section 6.7(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), and (y) if the annual
premiums or extension premium of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent or Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.7_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
any applicable contracts or Laws. All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time and rights to advancement of

 



 

43  expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in Organizational Documents of the Company or of any Subsidiary of
the Company or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party
and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Parent.

 

6.9 _Publicity_. Except with respect to any action taken pursuant to, and in
accordance with, _Section 6.4_ or _Article VIII_ , so long as this Agreement
is in effect, neither Parent nor the Company shall, or shall permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement
concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law or the applicable
rules of any stock exchange, in which event such party shall endeavor, on a
basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity
to the other parties to review and comment upon such press release or
other announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the party seeking to issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any such review or comment to the other party in
connection with any disclosure contemplated by _Section 6.4_ or any
disclosure of Parent or Merger Sub in response thereto or in connection
therewith; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the Company may make
public statements in response to specific questions by the press, analysts or
investors so long as any such statement is not inconsistent with previous
public statements permitted by this _Section 6.9_. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the Merger shall be in the
form agreed to by the parties.

 

6.10 _Rule 16b-3 Actions_. Parent and the Company agree that, in order to most
effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of the Company
who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time,
it is desirable that such Persons not be subject to a risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to
the provisions of this _Section 6.10_. Promptly after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.



 

44 6.11 _Other Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto shall refrain (and each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Affiliates to refrain) from taking, directly or
indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to, individually or
in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent shall, promptly following execution of this Agreement,
approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as sole stockholder of
Merger Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by
written consent approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance with
applicable Law and the Organizational Documents of Merger Sub. 

6.12 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or on terms which would not reasonably
be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the
Financing less likely to occur) and execute and deliver to the Company a copy
thereof concurrently with such execution, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions in the Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements for the
Financing that are within Parents control and comply with its obligations
thereunder and (iv) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter in the
event of a breach by the Financing Sources that impedes or materially delays
Closing, including seeking specific performance of the parties thereunder. In
the event that all conditions to the Financing Sources obligations under the
Commitment Letter have been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied,
Parent and Merger Sub shall, except where Parent has available to it
sufficient funding from any alternative financing, use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund on the Closing Date the
Financing required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including by taking enforcement
action, including seeking specific performance, to cause the Financing Sources
to fund such Financing). Parent shall have the right from time to time to
amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights
under, the Commitment Letter, _provided_ that any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of the
Commitment Letter shall not (A) expand upon the conditions precedent to the
Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter or (B) prevent or impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the obligations of Parent
under this _Section 6.12_ with respect to the Commitment Letter, it is
understood and agreed that Parent intends to seek to substitute other
financing for the Financing (such as the issuance of the "Notes," as that
term is used in the Commitment Letter) and it is agreed that Parent shall have
the right to substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion
of the Financing from the same or alternative financing sources. If the
Financing under the Commitment Letter becomes unavailable in an amount such
that Parent and Merger Sub will not be able to satisfy their obligations under
this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as reasonably 



 

45  practicable, alternative financing from alternative financial institutions
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of any
material breach by any party to the Commitment Letter or of any condition that
would not be satisfied, in each case, of which Parent becomes aware or any
termination of the Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed
on a reasonably prompt basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing.

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their
Representatives, including legal, tax and accounting, to provide, at Parents
sole expense, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement
and obtaining of the Financing or any substitute or alternative financing
(collectively with the Financing, the " _Definitive Financing_ ") as may be
reasonably requested by written notice provided a reasonable time in advance
to the Company by Parent ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the business or ongoing operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries), including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
provide, as promptly as reasonably practicable, information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Financing Sources or the lenders and other
financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the
Definitive Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers and placement
agents in connection with the Definitive Financing (the " _Definitive
Financing Sources_ ") (including (A) information to be used in
the preparation of a customary information package regarding the business,
operations, financial condition, projections and prospects of the Company and
its Subsidiaries customary for financings similar to the Definitive Financing,
(B) within 15 days after the end of each month, unaudited consolidated
balance sheets and related statements of income, changes in equity and cash
flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (C) no later that 20 days after the
end of each fiscal quarter of Parent, updated forecasts, prepared by
management of the Company, of balance sheets, income statements and cash flow
statements for each period referenced in Section 2(a)(iii) of the Commitment
Letter, and (D) the financial information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries described in clauses (v) and (vi) of Annex II to the Commitment
Letter) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent and/or the Definitive
Financing Sources to assist in preparation of customary offering or
information documents to be used for the completion of the Definitive
Financing, (ii) cause its senior management and other appropriate employees of
the Company to participate in a reasonable number of meetings (including
customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers for
the Definitive Financing), presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions
with the rating agencies, (iii) assist in the preparation of such documents
and materials as may be reasonably required in connection with the Definitive
Financing, including (A) any customary offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, Form 8-Ks, registration statements,
prospectuses and similar documents (including historical and pro forma
financial statements and information) for the Definitive Financing, and (B)
materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) consent to the use of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries logos to the extent customary in connection
with marketing the Definitive Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or 



 

46  reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or
the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (v)
execute and deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain from their
advisors), and cause its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use
reasonable best efforts to obtain from their advisors), customary certificates
(including with respect to solvency matters), accounting comfort letters
(including consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials
relating to the Definitive Financing), legal opinions or other documents and
instruments relating to guarantees and other matters ancillary to the
Definitive Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent as necessary
and customary in connection with the Definitive Financing, (vi) assist in the
preparation of and entering into one or more credit agreements and other loan
documents, underwriting or note purchase agreements, indentures or other
agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that no obligation of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under any such agreements or documents shall be effective
until the Effective Time, (vii) use its reasonable best efforts, as
appropriate, to have its independent accountants provide their reasonable
cooperation and assistance, including using its reasonable best efforts to

registration statements of Parent, (viii) provide authorization letters to

between the Definitive Financing Sources and the principal existing lenders of
the Company, (x) cooperate reasonably with the Definitive Financing Sources
due diligence investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent
customary and reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably interfering with
the business or operations of the Company, (xi) cooperate with Parent, if
requested by Parent, to appoint Parents designees to the board of directors
or similar governing bodies of the Subsidiaries of the Company, effective as
of the Effective Time, for the purpose of taking corporate action related to
the Definitive Financing as of the Effective Time, (xii) facilitating the
pledging of collateral for the Definitive Financing, including using
reasonable best efforts to take actions necessary to permit the Definitive
Financing Sources to evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries real
property and current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies
and procedures for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements and
establishing, as of the Effective Time, bank and other accounts and blocked
account agreements and lockbox arrangements in connection with the Definitive
Financing, (xiii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain such
consents, waivers, estoppels, approvals, authorizations and instruments which
may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the

engineering reports, surveys, title insurance, landlord consents, waivers and
access agreements, and (xiv) facilitating the consummation of the Definitive
Financing, including cooperating with Parent and Merger Sub to satisfy the
conditions precedent to the Definitive Financing to the extent within the
control of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the

 



 

47  Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub to permit the
consummation of the Definitive Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to
be made available to the Surviving Corporation immediately upon the Effective
Time; _provided_ that (A) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to pay any fees (including commitment or other similar fees) or
incur any other liability or expenses (unless promptly reimbursed by Parent)
in connection with the Definitive Financing prior to the Effective Time, (B)
nothing herein shall require such cooperation from the Company to the extent
it would require the Company to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement
and (C) Parent shall be responsible for the timely provision of any post-
Closing pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other
pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any pro forma financial
information to be delivered by the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.12_.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by them prior to the Effective Time in connection with the
Definitive Financing or the arrangement of the Definitive Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries), except to the extent
such losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses result from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives.

(c) In the event that the Commitment Letter is amended, replaced, supplemented
or otherwise modified, in accordance with _Section 6.12(a)_, or if Parent
substitutes other debt or equity financing for all or a portion of the
Financing, each of Parent and the Company shall comply with its covenants in
_Sections 6.12(a)_ and _(b)_ with respect to the Commitment Letter as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified or with respect to such
other substitute financing to the same extent that Parent and the Company
would have been obligated to comply with respect to the Financing.

(d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives or any other Person pursuant
to this _Section 6.12_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent shall be permitted to disclose
such customary and reasonable information to potential syndicate members
during syndication, ratings agencies and the like in connection with the
Definitive Financing as contemplated by this _Section 6.12_, subject to
customary confidentiality undertakings by such potential syndicate members.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Definitive Financing is not a condition to Closing.

6.13 _Litigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent if it receives notice of any Action
instituted or threatened against the Company or any of its directors, officers
or Affiliates, including by any Company Stockholder, before any court or
Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement, the Merger,



 

48  or the other transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking damages or
discovery in connection with such transactions. Until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective
Time, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense and settlement of any such litigation relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall
not settle any such litigation without Parents prior written consent.

6.14 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement is intended
to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control the Companys or
its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to give the Company, directly or
indirectly, the right to control Parents or its Subsidiaries operations
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company
and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control over its and its Subsidiaries respective
operations.

 

6.15 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
to Parent resignations executed by each director of the Company in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which resignations shall be effective
at the Effective Time and which resignations shall not have been revoked.

 

6.16 _Stock Exchange De-Listing_. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Companys securities to be de-listed from the New York Stock
Exchange and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.

 

6.17 _Debt Tender Offer_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt by the Company of a
written request by Parent (and a reasonable period of time in advance of the
anticipated Closing Date, as reasonably determined by Parent), the Company
shall promptly commence (or, at Parents choice, assist Parent or its
Affiliates in a third party commencement of) (i) an offer to purchase and/or
(ii) a consent solicitation with respect to all of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Companys then outstanding 11.5% Senior Secured Notes
due 2014 (the " _Notes_ ") on such terms and conditions as are reasonably
requested by Parent (including amendments to the terms and provisions of the
Indenture as reasonably requested by Parent) (including the related consent
solicitation, collectively, the " _Debt Tender Offer_ ") (and in any event so
as to accommodate Parents financing with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions provided for herein) and Parent shall assist the Company in
connection therewith. Promptly following the expiration date (as such date
may be extended from time to time) of the consent solicitation, assuming the
requisite consents are received, the Company shall execute, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee (as defined below) to execute, a
supplemental indenture to the Indenture, dated June 3, 2009 (the "
_Indenture_ "), by and between the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors party
thereto (collectively, the " _Issuers_ ") and The Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the " _Trustee_ "), effectuating the
amendments for which consents were obtained pursuant to the Debt Tender Offer,
which supplemental indenture shall become effective immediately 



 

49  upon the later of (i) acceptance for purchase of Notes properly tendered and
not properly withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer and (ii) the Effective Time.
The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt
Tender Offer (including engagement of a dealer manager and a depository agent
with respect thereto, in each case reasonably acceptable to Parent, and
delivery of any Officers Certificates and Opinions of Counsel (as such terms
are defined in the Indenture) required under the Indenture). The Debt Tender
Offer shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and, without
modifying the applicable obligations of the parties under this _Section
6.17_, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Notes to
be accepted for purchase and the supplemental indenture to the Indenture to
become effective on the Closing Date (including by making public announcements
extending the expiration date of the Debt Tender Offer as requested by Parent
and by the Company otherwise complying with the time periods required by Rule
14e-l under the Exchange Act). Unless otherwise agreed by Parent, concurrent
with the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Tender
Offer, the Company shall accept for purchase and purchase the Notes
(including any premium thereon and any consent payments applicable thereto)
properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer. Parent
shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Tender Offer and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs
and expenses suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in connection
with the Debt Tender Offer (except to the extent such losses, damages,
claims, costs and expenses result from the willful misconduct of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives), and the
foregoing obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.17_, the Company
shall not be obligated to consummate the Debt Tender Offer unless the Merger
has occurred or is occurring concurrently with the consummation of the Debt
Tender Offer and sufficient funds are available from the Definitive Financing
or from Parent to pay all consideration for the purchase of the Notes.

 

(b) If the required consents have not been received in the Debt Tender Offer,
or are not reasonably likely to be received, in each case, at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (with the number of Business Days
calculated in accordance with Rule 14e-l of the Exchange Act) or if Parent
determines not to request the commencement of the Debt Tender Offer, then at
Parents written request, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
party to the Indenture to, use reasonable best efforts to promptly take all
actions necessary and required to effect the satisfaction and discharge of
the Indenture and release of all "Liens" on "Collateral" (as such terms are
defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes pursuant to _Article
VIII_ of the Indenture, which satisfaction and discharge shall be effective
upon the Closing, and the Company shall concurrently with the Closing (i) give
irrevocable instructions to mail a notice of redemption to holders of the
Notes pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Indenture, (ii) deposit in trust all
required funds or U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the



 

50  Indenture) with respect to such satisfaction and discharge as set forth in
Section 8.1(a) of the Indenture and give irrevocable instructions to the
Trustee to apply the deposit toward the payment of the Notes upon redemption,
(iii) pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable pursuant to the
Indenture, and (iv) deliver to the Trustee such "Officers Certificates,"
"Opinions of Counsel," any required accountants certificates and "Board
Resolutions" in connection with a redemption (as such terms are defined in the
Indenture) in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee as to
satisfaction of all conditions precedent to such satisfaction and discharge,
such redemption and as to the other matters set forth in Articles V and VIII
of the Indenture; and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Trustee to acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture and
the release of all "Liens" on the "Collateral" in writing concurrently with
the Closing and the mailing of the notice of redemption to holders of the
Notes pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Indenture and the deposit of all
required funds or U.S. Government Obligations with respect to such
satisfaction and discharge. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not
be obligated to make any payments or deposit any funds under this  _Section
6.17(b)_ unless the Company shall have received from Parent the amounts
required to deposit with the Trustee to pay the redemption price for the Notes
as required pursuant to the Indenture and pay or cause to be paid all
other sums payable pursuant to the Indenture in connection therewith.

6.18 _Shareholders  Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent an agreement, in the form attached as Exhibit A to the
Voting Agreement, signed by the Company and Weston Presidio V, L.P.

all respects as of such date, and except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct as of the date of this

does not result in additional aggregate consideration payable by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.1_ in excess of $200,000 in
the aggregate), (ii) each of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in _Section 3.1(a)_, _Section 3.3_,  _Section 3.8(b)_, _Section

this Agreement other than those specifically referred to in clauses (i) and
(ii) immediately above (without giving effect to any limitation as to

as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing
Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly
relate to a specific date, in which case such representations and warranties
shall be true and correct as of such date), except where the failure to be so
true and correct does not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Parent and Merger Sub shall have received a
certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company to such effect.

 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the Company_. The Company shall have
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed

affidavit, in 



 

52  accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2) and in a form and

setting forth the Companys name, address and taxpayer identification number,

Parent, dated as of the Closing Date and executed by the Company.

correct in all respects as of such date); and (ii) each of the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement other
than those specifically referred to in clause (i) immediately above (without

under this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or, subject to the terms hereof, after the
Company Stockholders Approval (with any termination by Parent also being an
effective termination by Merger Sub):

 



 

53 (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if any applicable Law makes consummation
of the Merger illegal or any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
shall have issued a final and non-appealable Order or taken any other final
and non-appealable Action enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger; _provided_ that the right to terminate under this
_Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of this
Agreement (including _Section 6.3_ hereof) has been a proximate cause of, or
resulted in the issuance of, such Order;

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before January 31, 2011 (the " _Outside Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be available to the party whose failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement has been the proximate cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such
date;

 

(d) by Parent, in the event of a material breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein, or if
a representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, which in
either case, (x) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ (a " _Terminating Company Breach_ "),
and (y) is not cured (I) within thirty (30) Business Days following notice by
Parent of such Terminating Company Breach or (II) any shorter period of time
that remains between the date Parent provides notice of such Terminating
Company Breach and the Outside Date, _provided_ that Parent may not terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is in
willful and material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement and such breach would give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ ;

 

(e) by the Company, in the event of a material breach by Parent or Merger Sub,
as the case may be, of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein, or if a representation or warranty of Parent or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall have become untrue, which in either
case, (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in  _Section
7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ (a " _Terminating Parent Breach_ "), and (ii) is
not cured (x) within thirty (30) Business Days following notice by the Company
of such Terminating Parent Breach or (y) any shorter period of time that
remains between the date the Company provides notice of such Terminating
Parent Breach and the Outside Date, _provided_ that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 8.1(e)_ if the Company is in
willful and material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement and such breach would give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_;

(f) by either Parent or the Company, if the Company Stockholders shall
have failed to adopt and approve this Agreement at the Company Stockholders
Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;



 

54 (g) by Parent if (i) the Company Board shall have made a Change
of Recommendation or shall approve or recommend or otherwise declare
advisable to the Company Stockholders an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the
Company Board approves, adopts or recommends or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (iii)
following the date any bona fide Acquisition Proposal or any material
modification thereto is first publicly announced or publicly disclosed prior
to the time when the Company Stockholders Approval is obtained, the Company
fails to issue a press release that reaffirms the Company Recommendation
(prior to the earlier of (x) ten (10) Business Days following Parents written
request (which request may only be made once with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal absent further material changes in such Acquisition Proposal),
unless, in the case of the following clause (y), it would be inconsistent with
the Company Boards fiduciary duties to comply with such request within such
time period, in which case the Company shall comply with such request as
promptly as practicable consistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties)
and (y) five (5) Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, or
(iv) any tender offer or exchange offer constituting an Acquisition Proposal
is commenced or materially modified by any third party with respect to the
outstanding Company Common Stock prior to the time at which the Company
receives the Company Stockholders Approval, and the Company Board shall not
have recommended that the Company Stockholders reject such tender offer or
exchange offer and not tender their Company Common Stock into such tender
offer or exchange offer within ten (10) Business Days after commencement or
material modification of such tender offer or exchange offer, unless the
Company has issued a press release that expressly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation within such ten (10) Business Day period; or

(h) by the Company, at any time prior to the time the Company Stockholders
Approval is obtained, if the Company Board shall have (i) approved a Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.4(c)_, (ii) the Company prior to or
concurrently with such termination pays Parent in immediately available funds
the Company Termination Amount, and (iii) immediately after the termination of
this Agreement, the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to the Superior Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause
(i).

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in  _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall immediately
become null and void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or
directors of any of them shall have any liability or obligation of any nature
whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that _Section 6.5(b)_, the provisions of _Section 6.12_ and
_Section 6.17_ regarding reimbursement of expenses and indemnification, this
_Section 8.2_ and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be relieved or released from
liability for willful and material breach of this Agreement arising prior to
termination (it being understood and agreed that in

 



 

55  circumstances where a party is obligated to consummate the Merger in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such partys
failure to consummate the Merger shall be deemed a willful and material
breach of this Agreement).

(b) In the event this Agreement is:

 



     | (i) | terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or by
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_, and (A) after the date
hereof and prior to such termination date, any Person shall have publicly
made (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to the Company
or the Company Stockholders an Acquisition Proposal and (B) within twelve (12)
months of such termination date, the Company (x) enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to or consummates an Acquisition Proposal with the
Person that originally made such Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause
(A) or such Persons Affiliate, or (y) consummates an Acquisition Proposal
with any Person (for purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ the references to
"20% in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%"), 
---|---|--- 

then the Company shall make a cash payment to Parent in the amount of the
Company Termination Amount.

(c) If required under this _Section 8.2_, the Company Termination Amount
shall be paid in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days
after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such
payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company Termination Amount is
payable as a result of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_, then the
Company Termination Amount is payable prior to or concurrently with such
termination. The parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions for payment
of the Company Termination Amount are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and are included herein in order to induce
Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and to reimburse Parent and
Merger Sub for incurring the costs and expenses related to entering into this
Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that in the event the Company
Termination Amount becomes payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to 
_Section 8.2(b)_, the Company Termination Amount shall be Parent and Merger
Subs sole and exclusive remedy for damages under this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any



 

56  time before or after approval of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders
at the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any
approval of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, no amendment of this
Agreement shall be made that by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
stock exchange requires further approval by the Company Stockholders without
obtaining such approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholders Approval, no
extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof shall be made
that by Law requires further adoption and approval by the Company Stockholders
without obtaining such approval. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. No provision of
this Agreement requiring any party to use commercially reasonable efforts,
reasonable best efforts or to act in good faith in any context shall be
interpreted to require a party, as part of such partys duty to use
commercially reasonable efforts, reasonable best efforts or to act in good
faith in the context in question, to waive any condition to the obligations
of such party hereunder or to refrain from exercising any right or power such
party may have hereunder.

privileges granted by the DGCL and any other law of the State of Delaware.

FOURTH: The Corporation is authorized to issue one class of stock, to be

number of shares of Common Stock that the Corporation shall have authority to
issue is 1,000.

 

FIFTH: The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or
under the direction of the Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and
authority expressly conferred upon direction by statute or by this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the
directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such
acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation. Election of
directors need not be by written ballot, unless the Bylaws so provide.

 

SIXTH: The Board of Directors is authorized to make, adopt, amend, alter or
repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, except as otherwise specifically
provided therein. The stockholders shall also have power to make, adopt,
amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

or (iv) for any transaction  from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is
amended after the effective date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting
the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
the DGCL, as so amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the
foregoing paragraph shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission

director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(hereinafter an "Indemnitee"), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged
action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in
any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent,
shall be indemnified and held harmless and advanced expenses by the
Corporation, in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation, to the fullest
extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
(but, in the case of any such amendment, except as may be prohibited by
applicable law, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto),
against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments,
fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith
and such indemnification shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to
be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of
the Indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators.

 

(b) _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_ The rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

(c) _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the

expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of
Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the advancement of expenses

Incorporation inconsistent with this Article EIGHTH, shall eliminate or reduce
the effect of this Article EIGHTH in respect of any matter occurring, or

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

4.1. _RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (as a witness or
otherwise) in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a
"proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
an officer of the Corporation or, while serving as a director or an officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another corporation or of
a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged
action in an official capacity as a director, officer or trustee or in any
other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee, agent or
trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys
fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or   suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however,
that, except as provided in Section 4.3 with respect to proceedings to enforce
rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board of Directors.

 

4.2. _RIGHT TO ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES_. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in Section 4.1, an indemnitee shall also have the
right to be paid by the Corporation on an as-incurred basis the expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses");
provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL")
requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her
capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an unsecured undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or
on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this
Section 4.2 or otherwise. All advances hereunder shall be interest free and
shall be made without regard to indemnitees financial ability to repay any
amounts advanced. 

4.3. _RIGHT OF INDEMNITEE TO BRING SUIT_. If a claim under Section 4.1 or 4.2
is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim
has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an
advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days,
the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought
by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the
terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the
expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In any suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses),
it shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard
for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that
indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the
indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who
are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee
has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit
brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by
the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of
expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that
the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this Article IV or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. 4.4. _NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS_. The rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses conferred in this Article IV shall not be exclusive
of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement,
vote of stockholders or directors or otherwise.

4.5. _INSURANCE_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

4.6. _INDEMNIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS OF THE CORPORATION_. The
Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of
Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses
to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Article IV with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

 

4.7. _NATURE OF RIGHTS_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this
Article IV shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure
to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article IV that adversely affects any
right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall
not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

ARTICLE V.

 

 _TRANSFER OF SHARE CERTIFICATES_

 

Transfers of share certificates and the shares represented thereby shall be
made on the books of the Company only by the registered holder or by
duly authorized attorney. Transfers shall be made only on surrender of the
share certificate or certificates.

These bylaws may be amended or repealed at any regular or special meeting of
the board of directors by vote of a majority of all directors in office or at
any annual or special meeting of stockholders by vote of holders of a majority
of the outstanding stock entitled to vote. Notice of any such annual or
special meeting of stockholders shall set forth the proposed change or a
