respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as

of outstanding shares of Common Stock is changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or the like, other than pursuant to the Merger, the amount of Merger
Consideration payable per share of Common Stock shall be correspondingly
adjusted.

  

(f) All vested or unvested Company Restricted Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of this Agreement and, without
further action of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of such
Company Restricted Shares, vest and become free of all restrictions
immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be canceled, retired and
shall cease to exist and shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.

  

(g) The Company Options shall be treated as provided in Section 2.4.

  

Section 2.3 PAYMENT OF CASH FOR MERGER SHARES.

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to serve as the disbursing
agent for the Merger Consideration and payments in respect of the Company
Options, unless another agent is designated as provided in Section 2.4(a)
(the " **Disbursing Agent** "). At or prior to the Closing, Parent will
cause to be deposited with the Disbursing Agent cash in the aggregate
amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of all Merger
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus any cash
necessary to pay for Company Options

        



  

pursuant to Section 2.4. Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the
Disbursing Agent, such cash shall be held in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Merger Shares and such Company Options and shall not be used
for any other purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may direct
the Disbursing Agent to invest such cash in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America, as long as (i) no such investments
have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant
to Section 2.3(b) and all such investments are backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, and (ii) no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of the
shares of the Common Stock and following any losses Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Disbursing Agent for the benefit of
stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses.

  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than
five Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall
send, or cause the Disbursing Agent to send, to each record holder of Merger
Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a)) a letter of
transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for the
Merger Consideration payable therefor.  The letter of transmittal will be in
customary form and will specify that delivery of Merger Shares will be
effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon delivery of the
stock certificates representing the Merger Shares to the Disbursing Agent.
Upon surrender of such stock certificate or certificates to the Disbursing
Agent together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of
transmittal and any other documentation that the Disbursing Agent may
reasonably require, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor, less any withholding
Taxes deductible under Section 2.3(i). Until so surrendered and exchanged,
each such certificate shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and until such surrender
and exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder of such certificate in
respect thereof.

  

(c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Merger Shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
certificate or certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Disbursing Agent any applicable stock transfer taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Merger Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the
Disbursing Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not
payable.

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, certificates representing Merger Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, such shares shall be canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article II.

        



  

(e) If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed nine
months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holder who has not surrendered Merger Share
certificates for the Merger Consideration prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Disbursing Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of Merger Shares for an
amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed
property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares as
of a date immediately prior to such time that such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation on such date, free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate for shares of Common
Stock.

  

(g) From and after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common
Stock, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in this Agreement.

  

(h) In the event that any Merger Share certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the Person
claiming such Merger Share certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in
addition to the posting by such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Merger
Share certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue and deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Merger Share certificate the proper amount
of the Merger Consideration.

  

(i) Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
hereunder any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any
applicable Tax Law.  To the extent any amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder
from whose Merger Consideration the amounts were so deducted and withheld.

  

Section 2.4 TREATMENT OF OPTIONS.

  

(a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option other than the Company
Options described in 
 Section 2.4(b), to the extent outstanding and unexercised will be
canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof (each, an "
**Option Holder** ") will be entitled to receive in consideration of
the cancellation and as settlement of all rights of such Option Holder with
respect to such Company Option, an amount in cash equal to the excess (if
any) of (A) the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Company Option and (ii) the Merger Consideration over (B)
the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option, without interest and
less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any applicable

        



  

Law. All payments with respect to canceled Company Options shall be made by
the Disbursing Agent (or such other agent reasonably acceptable to the
Company as Parent shall designate prior to the Effective Time) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at
the direction of Parent to pay such amounts in accordance with Section
2.3(a) but in no event later than five Business Days after the Effective
Time.

  

(b) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option granted on July 5, 2007, to
the extent outstanding and unexercised will be canceled and converted into
the right to receive in consideration of the cancellation and settlement of
all rights of the Option Holder with respect to such Company Option, a cash
payment on the Cashout Payment Date in an amount equal to the excess (if any)
of (A) the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
such Company Option and (ii) the Merger Consideration over (B) the aggregate
exercise price of such Company Option, without interest and less any amounts
required to be deducted and withheld under any applicable Law (the " _Cashout
Payment_ ").

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent (or their respective
boards of directors or applicable committees thereof) will adopt such
resolutions and take such other action as may be reasonably required to
effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.4, without paying any
consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation.

  

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts to be paid hereunder in respect of Company Options
or Company Restricted Shares any amounts required to be deducted and withheld
under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
Option Holder or the holder of such Company Restricted Share from
whose payments in respect of Company Options or Company Restricted Shares the
amounts were so deducted and withheld.

  

Section 2.5 ESPP. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions that may be necessary to shorten the offer period of the ESPP then in
progress by setting a new exercise date under the ESPP which shall be the day
before the date on which the Effective Time occurs. Upon the occurrence of
such new exercise date, each option to purchase shares of Common Stock
granted under the ESPP will be automatically exercised upon such new exercise
date, subject to the completion of the Merger, unless a participant of the
ESPP withdraws from such offer period. Upon the expiration of such offer
period and the occurrence of the new exercise date, no further offering
period or purchase period shall commence under the ESPP. Immediately prior to
and effective as of the Effective Time (and subject to the consummation of
the Merger), the Company shall terminate the ESPP. Each share of Common
Stock purchased under the ESPP shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive the per share Merger Consideration on the same basis as
all other shares of Common Stock, except that each such share shall
be automatically converted into the right to receive the per share
Merger Consideration without the issuance of a certificate representing such
share.

of a material benefit under or give to any other Person any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration, payment or cancellation of, under any
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by

properties or assets is bound or affected, except those consents set forth
in Section 4.4 of the Disclosure Letter (the " **Required Contractual
Consents** "); or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien or

have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No "fair price," "moratorium,"

Subsidiarys certificate of organization, bylaws or similar documents (other

with Section 409A of the Code. No Company Option outstanding as of the

Section 6.5 SOLICITATION.

  

(a) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. (EST) on the 30th day after the date of this Agreement (the
" **Exclusivity Period Start Date** "), the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives shall have the right (acting under the
direction of the Board of Directors) to: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage,
whether publicly or otherwise, Company Acquisition Proposals (as hereinafter
defined), including by way of providing access to non-public information
pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreements (as hereinafter defined); _provided_ that the Company shall
promptly provide to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person
given such access which was not previously provided to Parent and Merger Sub;
and (ii) enter into and maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with
respect to Company Acquisition Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or

discussions or negotiations. Within 24 hours following the Exclusivity Period
Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent of (i) the number of Excluded
Parties and the identity of each such Excluded Party and (ii) the material
terms and conditions of each Excluded Partys indication of interest or
acquisition proposal and any documents and related correspondence provided in
connection therewith (including any amendment and modifications to
the foregoing) received from each Excluded Party.

  

(b) Subject to Section 6.5(c), and except as may relate to an Excluded Party,
from the Exclusivity Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII,
the Company shall not, and shall not direct, authorize or permit any of the
Companys Representatives, and shall be responsible for noncompliance with
the following provisions by any of the foregoing, to, directly or indirectly,
 (A) initiate, continue, solicit or encourage (including by way of providing
information, it being understood that providing non-public information in the
ordinary course of business will not, in and of itself, constitute
encouragement hereunder) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers
or any other efforts or attempts that constitute or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal or engage in any
discussions or negotiations with respect thereto (other than to state only
that they are not permitted to have discussions) or otherwise cooperate with
or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations or (B) accept a Company Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) providing for or relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may continue to take any of the
actions described in clause (A) above from and after the Exclusivity Period
Start Date with respect to any Excluded Party. Subject to Section 6.5(c) and
except as may relate to an Excluded Party, on the Exclusivity Period Start
Date the Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any
Persons conducted theretofore by the Company or any Companys Representatives
with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.5(b), and
in addition to the rights of the Company pursuant to Section 6.5(a) if at any
time prior to

        



  

obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company has otherwise
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.5
and the Company has received a written Company Acquisition Proposal from a
third party that the Board of Directors of the Company believes in good faith
to be bona fide and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
then the Company may (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and
(y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that the Company (A) will not, and will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Companys Representatives not to, disclose any non-
public information to such Person without entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, (B) will promptly provide to Parent and Merger Sub
any material non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which was not previously provided
or made available to Parent and Merger Sub and (C) in the event it receives
such Company Acquisition Proposal, will promptly, and in any case within 24
hours after receipt thereof, notify Parent and Merger Sub of such Company
Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions thereof and
the identity of the party making such proposal or inquiry, and shall keep
Parent and Merger Sub reasonably informed as to the status and any material
developments concerning the same including providing copies of any such
written inquiries, correspondence, and summaries of any material oral
inquiries or discussions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in Section 6.5(b) or this Section 6.5(c), but subject to the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, after the Exclusivity Period Start Date and
prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote, the Company shall in any
event be permitted to take the actions described in clauses (x) and (y) above
with respect to any Excluded Party. Nothing contained in this Section 6.5(c)
shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (x) from
taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect
to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) from making any other
disclosure required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that with
respect to clause (x) any such disclosure that is not a recommendation of
rejection of such offer or a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall directly or indirectly (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee
thereof of this Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any alternative Company Acquisition
Proposal, including any Permitted Alternative Agreement (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as an " **Adverse
Recommendation Change** ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar

        



  

agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and, to the extent a Company
Acquisition Proposal involves the issuance of securities to stockholders of
the Company, other than an appropriate confidentiality agreement that allows
the Company to receive and review confidential information with respect to a
proposed issuer of any such securities) (a " **Company Acquisition Agreement**
"); _provided_ that the Company shall not be prohibited from terminating this
Agreement and entering into a Permitted Alternative Agreement in accordance
with Section 8.1(e). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors
of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if such Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Board
of Directors notifies Parent in writing of its intention to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change at least three days prior to doing so.

  

(e) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall provide notice promptly
to Parent and Merger Sub of any resolution to take any actions described in
this Section 6.5 or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e).

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, the term:

  

(i) " **Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement** " means a confidentiality and
standstill agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in
the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement may include provisions that are less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement so long as the Company
offers to amend and immediately so amends if requested by Parent, the
Confidentiality Agreement, concurrently with execution of such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, to include substantially similar provisions for
the benefit of Parent;

  

(ii) " **Company Acquisition Proposal** " means any inquiry, proposal or
offer from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective Affiliates relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a business that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
15% or more of the outstanding Company Securities, any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group of
Persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding Company
Securities, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the
Company whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole);
provided that, for the purpose of clause (Y) in Section 8.2, the reference to
"15% or more" in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall be
changed to "50% or more";

        



  

(iii) " **Superior Proposal** " means a Company Acquisition Proposal (but
changing the references to "15% or more" in the definition of "Company
Acquisition Proposal" to "50% or more") which the Board of Directors of the
Company in good faith determines after consultation with the Companys
financial advisors and outside legal counsel to be a transaction that is more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company (in their capacities as
stockholders) than the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

Section 6.6 RULE 16B-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

Section 6.7 DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.

  

(a) _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Without
limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any indemnification agreement, employment agreement or the Company Award
Plans, from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, to the full extent permitted by Law, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director
or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " **Indemnified
Parties** "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " **Costs** "), incurred in
connection with any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (each, a " **Proceeding** ") to which an Indemnified Party
is a party or with respect to which an Indemnified Party is otherwise
involved (including as a witness), arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee,
fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or before the
Effective Time (including any Proceeding arising out of or pertaining to this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether such
Proceeding is commenced, or any claim or matter therein is asserted or
claimed, prior to, at or after the Effective Time. In the event of any
such Proceeding (x) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement
from Parent or the Surviving Corporation of fees, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred in
connection with and prior to the final disposition of such Proceedings, such
fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) to be advanced within twenty business days of receipt by
Parent from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to
the extent required by DGCL or the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or
By-Laws, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification, (y) neither Parent nor Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any Proceeding in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party (which term for purposes of this clause (y) only shall
include only those persons who are officers, directors or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement)
hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out

        



  

of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents, and (z) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate
in the defense of any such matter.

  

(b) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers not less
advantageous in any material respect than those set forth in Exhibit A and
Exhibit B hereto, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals in any material respect.

  

(c) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six years from
the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with coverage
containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous in any
material respect to any beneficiary thereof) with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and from insurance carriers
with substantially comparable credit ratings; _provided_  that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_   _further_ that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount. At the Companys option, the
Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail
policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing benefits
which are not less advantageous in any material respect than those of the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering
without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Party
is a party to or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) in any
Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
Section 6.7 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
Proceeding.

  

(e) From and after the Effective Time, this covenant is intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The rights
to indemnification and advancement and the other rights provided for herein
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified
Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

  

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving

        



  

Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in Section 6.6 and this Section 6.7.

  

Section 6.8 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including filing as promptly as practicable, all documentation to
effect all necessary consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations, Permits or
orders from all Governmental Authorities or other Persons and to preserve the
benefit of the Merger for Parent relating to the Subsidiaries located in
Spain in the event that anti-trust approval of the Merger has not been
obtained in Spain prior to the Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to consummate the financings contemplated by the
Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter. Each party shall also
refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would be
reasonably likely to result in a failure of any of the conditions to the
Merger in this Agreement being satisfied or restrict such partys ability to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.  If
any takeover, anti-takeover, moratorium, "fair price," "control share" or
other similar Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger, the parties
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts, to take all action
necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

Section 6.9 CERTAIN FILINGS.

  

(a) The parties shall cooperate with one another (i) in determining whether
any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is
required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from any parties to any Contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in
seeking and obtaining any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or
making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith or with the Company Proxy Statement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the conditions to the parties respective obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to those conditions
specified in Article VII. The parties shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each will consult the other
on, all the information relating to the other and each of their respective
Subsidiaries that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company
and Parent shall promptly notify and provide a copy to the other party of
any substantive written communication received from any Governmental
Authority with respect to any filing or submission or with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Each of
the Company and Parent shall give the other reasonable prior notice of any
substantive communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking
or agreement with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filing or
any such transaction. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they
permit their respective representatives to, participate independently in any
meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such

        



  

filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior
notice of such meeting or conversation and without giving, unless prohibited
by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity of the other party to attend
or participate.  The parties to this Agreement will consult and cooperate
with one another in connection with any analyses, appearance, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party to this Agreement in connection with proceedings under
or related to the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Laws.

  

(b) The Company, subject to Parents prior review, shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken (A) assuming Parent timely supplies
the information required from it and provides reasonable cooperation to the
Company, all actions necessary, proper or advisable with respect to the
prompt preparation and filing with the SEC of the Company Proxy Statement,
(B) such actions as may be required to have the Company Proxy Statement and
any related materials cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable, and (C) such actions as may be required to be taken under the
Exchange Act and state securities or applicable Blue Sky Laws in connection
with the Merger.  In addition, the parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as promptly as reasonably
practicable all necessary documentation, effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions and filings, and use all reasonable best efforts to obtain
all material Permits from any Governmental Authorities necessary to
consummate the Merger (including, without limitation, any filing under the
HSR Act or any applicable Other Antitrust Law), including (1) responding as
promptly as practicable to any inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission
and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for additional
information or documentation; and (2) complying with the requirements of, and
responding as promptly as reasonably practicable to all inquiries and
requests received from any Governmental Authority in connection with, the HSR
Act or Other Antitrust Laws related to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

Section 6.10 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
the parties will consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public
statement as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or quotation system, will not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the consent of the
other parties (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or
withheld). The parties agree that the press release announcing the execution
and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of the parties.

  

Section 6.11 FURTHER ASSURANCES. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company.

        



  

Section 6.12 NOTICES OF CERTAIN EVENTS. Each of the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall use reasonable
best efforts to promptly notify the other party of:

  

(a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to cause any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect as of the Closing;

  

(b) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event, the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to cause
the failure by such party to comply with or satisfy, any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;

  

(c) the receipt by such party of any notice or other communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person, which consent is or could
reasonably be expected to be material to such Person or the operation of
their businesses, is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(d) the receipt by such party of any material notice or other material
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

  

(e) its learning of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced against, or affecting such party that, if they were pending on the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to
this Agreement or which relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

Section 6.13 DISPOSITION OF LITIGATION. The Company will keep Parent and
Merger Sub reasonably apprised of all important developments relating to, and
consult with Parent and Merger Sub with respect to, any action by any third
party to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, subject to Section 6.5, will
use reasonable best efforts to resist any such effort to restrain or prohibit
or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub may participate in (but not control)
the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company
and its Directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
at Parent and Merger Subs sole cost and expense (subject to Section 8.2);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to without
the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld).  In addition, subject to Section 6.5, the Company will
cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to resist any such effort to restrain or
prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

Section 6.14 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

  

(a) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to each current and former employee of the
Company and its

        



  

Subsidiaries (" **Company Employees** ") after the Effective Time (the "
**New Plans** "), except as would result in a duplication of benefits and
benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan, each Company Employee shall be
credited with all years of service for which such Company Employee was
credited before the Effective Time under any similar Employee Plans:
In addition, except as restricted by the insurance carriers for the New Plans
(and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to waive any such
restrictions): (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " **Old Plans** "); and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, disability,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall

(b) by either the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, if:

  

(i) the Merger has not been consummated by the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) if the failure to consummate the Merger by

(including in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) or the failure on the part of
such party (including in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to perform any
covenant or obligation in this Agreement that is required to be performed by
such party (including in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) at or prior to the
Effective Time; and _provided_ _further_  that the Company may not terminate

best efforts to oppose such order, decree or ruling; or

  

(iii) at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment thereof at which
this Agreement has been voted upon, the Company stockholders fail to adopt
this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder Vote; _provided_ that the right
to terminate under this Section 8.1(b)(iii) shall not be available to the
Company if the Company is in material breach of its obligations under
Sections 6.2 or 6.5;

  

(c) by the Company, if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.3(a) or (b) not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of
being cured by the Outside Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company
is not then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.1, 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not to be satisfied;

        



  

(d) by Parent, if:

  

(i) a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the

Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in
material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this

Board of Directors of the Company shall not so resolve unless (A) the Company
shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under
Section 6.5, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined
in good faith (after consultation with the Companys independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel) the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach by the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (C) the Company shall
have first provided Parent with three days prior notice that the Board of
Directors of the Company is prepared to effect such resolution, which notice
shall specify the reasons therefor and include all material terms and
conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal (and shall contemporaneously
provide a copy to Parent of the relevant proposed transaction agreement and

cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith regarding
adjustments to this Agreement that may be proposed by Parent ( _provided_ ,

(including any change in the pricing terms) of such Company Acquisition
Proposal, then the Company must deliver a new notice and recommence the
three-day negotiation period prior to effecting such resolution); (ii)
immediately following the Board of Directors of the Company so resolving, the
Company shall have so notified Parent and provided the final terms and
conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal; and (iii) the Company shall
have the right to enter into such a definitive agreement (a "

of such agreement is conditioned upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) and compliance with Section 8.2 and (C)
immediately following the execution of such agreement, a copy of
such agreement and all related agreements, exhibits, schedules and other
documents are delivered to Parent and Merger Sub.

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)
through (f) shall give written notice of such termination to the other party
in accordance with Section 9.1 of this Agreement; _ provided_ , _however_ ,
that no termination by the Company shall be effective unless and

        



  

until the Company shall have paid the Pre-Exclusivity Termination Fee or the
Termination Fee, as the case may be, and any other amounts then required to
be paid by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2.

  

Section 8.2 TERMINATION FEES. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, (i) if, prior to the Exclusivity Period Start Date, this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and the Company has
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal prior
to the Exclusivity Period Start Date, then the Company shall pay to Parent
and Merger Sub or their designee(s), collectively, at or prior to such
termination, a break-up fee of $25,000,000 (the " **Pre-
Exclusivity Termination Fee** ") plus all of Parents and Merger Subs actual
and reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses and fees (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
**Parent Expenses** "), which amount shall not be greater than $7,500,000
and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii)
or Section 8.1(e) (other than as set forth in the preceding clause (i))
then the Company shall pay to Parent and Merger Sub or their
designee(s), collectively, at or prior to such termination, a break-up fee of
$40,000,000 (the " **Termination Fee** ") plus Parent Expenses, which amount
shall not be greater than $10,000,000. In addition, if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) or Section 8.1(d)(i), then the
Company shall pay to Parent and Merger Sub or their designee(s), the Parent
Expenses, which amount shall not be greater than $10,000,000, immediately
following such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (X) if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), Section 8.1(b)(iii) or
Section 8.1(d)(i), (Y) at the time of such termination a Company Acquisition
Proposal has been made public and not withdrawn, and (Z) within 12 ****
months after such termination, either (A) a Company Acquisition Proposal is
consummated or (B) the Company enters into a definitive agreement in respect
of such a transaction, then the Company shall pay to Parent and Merger Sub,
collectively, the Termination Fee plus Parent Expenses, which amount shall
not be greater than $10,000,000, to the extent not previously paid to Parent
and Merger Sub upon the date of the occurrence of the earliest event
described in clauses (A) and (B). Any payment of Parent Expenses shall be
made by the Company within two Business Days after the date on which Parent
provides the Company appropriate documentation of such fees and expenses. The
parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that
without these agreements the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not have
entered into this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 8.2 do not constitute a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties further agree
that in the event any payment, as the case may be, of (a) the Pre-Exclusivity
Termination Fee plus the Parent Expenses as contemplated in clause (i) above
or (b) the Termination Fee plus the Parent Expenses as contemplated in clause
(ii) above, is made by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
this Section 8.2, such payments shall be the exclusive remedy available
to Parent and Merger Sub and, upon payment of such amounts by the Company,
the Company shall have no further liability to Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder.

        



  

Section 8.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except (i)
Sections 8.2 and 8.3, and Article IX will survive the termination hereof and
(ii) with respect to any liabilities for damages incurred or suffered by a
party as a result of (x) the breach by any other party of Section 6.4(g) or
(y) the willful and material breach by any other party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive

partys obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of
specific performance of its obligations hereunder, in addition to any other

any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue
of any suit, action or proceeding in any of those courts or that any suit,
action or proceeding which is brought in any of those courts has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.  Each of the parties hereto unconditionally agrees
that, to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process
in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of
Delaware as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process.  Process in
any suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the

and such service shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party within the
State of Delaware.

  

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY

WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER,

        



  

(III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

  

Section 9.13 INTERPRETATION. Any statute, regulation, or other law defined or
referred to herein (or in any agreement or instrument that is referred
to herein) means such statue, regulation or other law as, from time to time,
may be amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successors statutes.  References to a person

Section 9.14 GUARANTEE BY THE GUARANTOR.

representations. The Guarantors responsibility shall not be discharged,
released, diminished, or impaired in whole or in part by (a) any setoff,
counterclaim, defense, act or occurrence which the Guarantor may have against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result or arising out of this or
any other transaction, or (b) the amendment, modification, waiver or
alteration of this Agreement, with or without the knowledge or consent of the

Tenth: Indemnification

  

10.1 _Right to Indemnification_ : The Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently

was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved
in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she, or
a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity (an "
_Other Entity_ "), including service with respect to employee benefit plans,
against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys
fees) reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.3, the
Corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection
with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if
the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person
was authorized by the Board.

  

10.2 _Prepayment of Expenses_ : The Corporation shall pay the expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any
Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, _provided_ , _however_
, that, to the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses

upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts
advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not
entitled to be indemnified under this Section Tenth or otherwise.

  

10.3 _Claims_. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses
under this Section Tenth is not paid in full within 30 days after a written
claim therefore by the Covered Person has been received by the Corporation,
the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim
and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the
expense of prosecuting such claim.  In any such action the Corporation shall
have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the
requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.

  

10.4 _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any Covered Person
by this Section Tenth shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such
Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of
this Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

  

10.5 _Other Sources_. The Corporations obligation, if any, to indemnify or
to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its
request as a director, officer, employee or agent of an Other Entity shall be
reduced by any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or
advancement of expenses from such Other Entity.

  

10.6 _Amendment or Repeal_. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing
provisions of this Section Tenth shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of    



  

any Covered Person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the
time of such repeal or modification.

  

10.7 _Other Indemnification and Prepayment of Expenses_.  This Section Tenth
shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons
other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by appropriate corporate    

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 18th day of July, 2007.
