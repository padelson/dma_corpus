WHEREAS, each of the respective boards of directors of Parkway, Cousins and

execution of this Agreement by Parkway LP and Merger Sub, respectively, and
to approve the consummation by Parkway LP and Merger Sub, respectively, of the

as applicable;

 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, immediately after the Merger, pursuant to the

assumed by, a partnership Subsidiary of Parkway LP, (b) the limited
partner interests in such partnership subsidiary will immediately thereafter
be distributed ratably to the partners of Parkway LP, and (c) after such

properties in Houston, together with certain other assets listed on Schedule 2
to _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _Houston Business_ "), as more fully described
in this Agreement and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger and the Reorganization, TPG VI Pantera
Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _TPG_ "), and TPG VI

Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
(b) this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a separate "plan
of reorganization" for the Merger for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code, and (c) it is intended that the contributions conducted pursuant to the
Reorganization (to the extent the Houston Business and/or Non-Houston Business
is contributed to an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in exchange for equity interests in such partnership) will
qualify as contributions of property pursuant to Section 721 of the Code.

 (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), to the Exchange Agent, and which

surrender of the Parkway Certificates or Parkway Limited Voting Certificates,
as the case may be, in exchange for certificates or, at Cousinss option,
evidence of shares in book-entry form representing the shares of Cousins
Common Stock or Cousins Limited Voting Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_, together with, in the case of Cousins
Common Stock, any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in
respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Cousins Common Stock
pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ and any cash such holder
is entitled to receive in lieu of fractional shares of Cousins Common Stock
pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_; and

Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder
of such Parkway Certificate or Parkway Limited Voting Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the shares of Cousins Common Stock or
Cousins Limited Voting Preferred Stock, as applicable, formerly represented by
such Parkway Certificate or Parkway Limited Voting Certificate pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, plus any amounts that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of
Cousins Common Stock pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ and
any cash such holder is entitled to receive in lieu of fractional shares of
Cousins Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to and

Exchange Agents receipt of such Parkway Certificate or Parkway Limited
Voting Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and the Parkway
Certificate or Parkway Limited Voting Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Parkway Certificates and Parkway Limited Voting Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each Certificate shall

entitled to receive in respect of such Parkway Book-Entry Shares or
Parkway Limited Voting Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II, in each
case, automatically without any action on the part of such holder or delivery
of any certificate, Letter of Transmittal or other evidence to the Exchange
Agent, and such Parkway Book-Entry Shares and/or Parkway Limited Voting Book-
Entry Shares shall then be cancelled; and

(B) subject to  _Section 2.5(f)_, to issue and deliver to each holder of

holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions
on shares of Cousins Common Stock pursuant to and in accordance with _Section

-5- ##### Table of Contents

  

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Parkway Common Stock
or Parkway Limited Voting Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of Parkway, it shall be a condition of payment that any Parkway
Certificate and/or Parkway Limited Voting Stock Certificate surrendered in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.2_ shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, or any
Parkway Book-Entry Shares and/or Parkway Limited Voting Book-Entry Shares
shall be properly transferred, and that the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any Transfer Taxes and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Parkway Certificate and/or Parkway Limited Voting Stock
Certificate surrendered or Parkway Book-Entry Shares and/or Parkway Limited
Voting Book-Entry Shares properly transferred, or shall have established to
the satisfaction of Cousins that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of (A)
holders of the Parkway Certificate and/or Parkway Limited Voting Certificates
on the consideration otherwise payable upon the surrender of the Parkway
Certificate and Parkway Limited Voting Certificates pursuant to this Article
II or (B) Parkway Book-Entry Shares and/or Parkway Limited Voting Book-Entry
Shares on the consideration otherwise payable in respect of such shares
pursuant to this Article II.

 

(c) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Cousins Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Cousins
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Parkway Certificate with respect to the shares of
Cousins Common Stock represented thereby and issuable hereunder, and all
such dividends and other distributions shall instead be deposited by Cousins
with the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to  _Section 2.2(e)_, in each case until the holder of such Parkway
Certificate shall surrender such Parkway Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following the surrender
of any such Parkway Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates and/or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing whole
shares of Cousins Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(i) at the time of such surrender the amount of any cash payable with respect
to a fractional share of Cousins Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
(but withheld pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to
such whole shares of Cousins Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Cousins Common Stock.
For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the Organizational Documents
of Parkway, the holders of Parkway Limited Voting Stock are not entitled or
eligible to receive any dividends or other distributions from Parkway, and as
of the Effective Time, the holders of Cousins Limited Voting Preferred Stock
formerly represented by such Parkway Limited Voting Stock in accordance with
this Article II will not be entitled or eligible to receive any dividends or
other distributions from the Surviving Corporation or Cousins.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights_. All shares of Cousins Common Stock or
Cousins Limited Voting Preferred Stock issued upon conversion of shares of
Parkway Common Stock (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ or

Stock have been converted pursuant to this Article II.

who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Parkway
Common Stock and/or Parkway Limited Voting Stock, including any amounts in

Limited Voting Preferred Stock (or dividends or other distributions
with respect thereto) or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Cousins Common
Stock from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any

the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal
representatives previously entitled thereto.

Parkway LP or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct

or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld by Cousins, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, Parkway LP or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Cousins, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation, Parkway LP or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable.

 

Section 2.3 _Structure_. In the event that the parties mutually agree upon
changes regarding the structure of the transactions contemplated herein
(including the Reorganization), the parties shall cooperate in the

(each, a " _Parkway Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed by Cousins and shall be converted into an option (a "
_Cousins Stock Option_ ") to acquire (i) that number of shares of Cousins
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Parkway Common
Stock subject to such Parkway Stock Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per share
of Cousins Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the

Common Stock of such Parkway Stock Option by (B) the Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that each such Parkway Stock Option which is an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be

subject to any performance condition that has not been satisfied) shall
automatically become fully vested (which, for Scheduled Parkway RSU Awards
subject to performance conditions, shall mean fully vested based on maximum
performance achievement), and all restrictions with respect thereto shall
lapse as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each share of Parkway
Common Stock resulting from the vesting of Scheduled Parkway RSU Awards
in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be treated as a share of
Parkway Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and shall be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of
Cousins Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)(i)_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, any dividend

and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such other party may reasonably request. Neither party nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any
Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. For the avoidance of doubt,
each party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, designate any
competitively sensitive materials provided under this _Section 5.2_ (or

the accuracy of the representations and warranties in _Section
3.1(h)(viii)(A)_ and _(B)_.

 

(c) The parties will hold any such information which is nonpublic in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the letter dated June 15, 2015, between Parkway and Cousins, as amended
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.

assigns of the Cousins (or the Surviving Corporation), as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, any obligation of the Surviving
Corporation to maintain and honor insurance policies pursuant to this _Section
5.9_ shall survive the Reorganization and the Houston Distribution; provided
that, through the Distribution Agreement, the Surviving Corporation may assign
to HoustonCo obligations that relate to such policies, subject to the terms
and conditions of the Distribution Agreement, as mutually agreed between
Parkway and Cousins.

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.9_;
provided, that such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such
expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Cousins, Parkway and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended in a
manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party (including his or her
successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs) affected
thereby, and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by
contract or otherwise.

Section 5.10 _Dividends_. (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement, neither
Parkway, Parkway LP nor Cousins shall make, declare or set aside any dividend
or other distribution to its respective stockholders without the prior
written consent of Parkway (in the case of Cousins) or Cousins (in the case of
Parkway or Parkway LP); _provided_ , _however_ , that the written consent of
the other party shall not be required for the authorization and payment of
quarterly distributions at a rate not in excess of the regular quarterly cash
dividend most recently declared prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect to each of the shares of Parkway Common Stock and shares of Cousins
Common Stock, respectively (it being agreed that the timing of any such
quarterly distributions will be coordinated so that, if either the holders of
Parkway Common Stock or the holders of shares of Cousins Common Stock receives
a distribution for a particular quarter prior to the Closing Date, then the
holders of shares of Cousins Common Stock and the holders of Parkway Common
Stock, respectively, shall receive a distribution for such quarter prior to
the Closing Date); _provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , that the record and
payment dates for Cousinss and Parkways distributions pursuant to this
_Section 5.10(a)_ shall be the same as the other partys record and payment
dates.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, each of Parkway and Cousins, as applicable, shall be permitted to
declare and pay a dividend to its stockholders, the record date and payment
date for which shall be the close of business on the last Business Day prior
to the Closing Date, distributing any amounts determined by such party (in
each case in consultation with the other party) to be the minimum dividend
required to be distributed in order for such party to qualify as a REIT and to
avoid to the extent reasonably possible the incurrence of income or excise
Tax (any dividend paid pursuant to this paragraph, a " _REIT Dividend_ ").

(c) If either party determines that it is necessary to declare a REIT
Dividend, it shall notify the other party at least twenty (20) days prior to
the date for the Parkway Stockholders Meeting, in the case of a declaration by
Parkway, or the Cousins Stockholders Meeting, in the case of a declaration by
Cousins, and such other party shall be entitled to declare a dividend per
share payable (i) in the case of Parkway, to holders of Parkway Common Stock,
in an amount per share of Parkway Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) the REIT Dividend declared by Cousins with respect to each
share of Cousins Common Stock by (B) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) in the case
of Cousins, to holders of shares of Cousins Common Stock, in an amount per
share of Cousins Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the REIT Dividend
declared by Parkway with respect to each share of Parkway Common Stock and (y)
the Exchange Ratio. The record date and payment date for any dividend payable
pursuant to this _Section 5.10(c)_ shall be the close of business on the last
Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Parkway and Cousins shall use reasonable
best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that
all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Houston Distribution) shall be
consistent with such joint communications plan, and (c) except in respect of
any announcement required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, or as required in
connection with required notifications or filings under the HSR Act or any
foreign antirust, competition, or merger control law or in response to any
request by a Governmental Entity investigating the transactions described
herein, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the
extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Houston
Distribution). In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in
or consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Houston
Distribution Prospectus in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.1_ or
as otherwise permitted under _Section 5.4_, or as required in connection with
required notifications or filings under the HSR Act or any foreign antirust,
competition, or merger control law or in response to any request by a
Governmental Entity investigating the transactions described herein, no party
shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or
disclosure concerning the other party or the other partys business, financial
condition or results of operations without the consent of such other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party shall
provide the other party with its stockholder lists and allow and facilitate
the other partys contact with its stockholders and prospective investors and
following a Change in Parkway Recommendation or Change in
Cousins Recommendation, as the case may be; such contacts may be made without
regard to the above limitations of this _Section 5.11_.

 

Section 5.12 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or to vest Cousins with full title to all properties,
assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of Parkway, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all
such necessary action.

Section 5.13 _Tax Matters_. (a) Parkway and Cousins agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii)
effect the Reorganization in a manner such that Step 5(a) set forth on
_Exhibit B_ will be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a
taxable transaction to Cousins and Step 6 set forth on _Exhibit B_ will be
treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a taxable transaction to
both Cousins and the stockholders of Cousins. The parties shall treat the
Merger as a tax-free "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code and no
party shall take any

 position for tax purposes inconsistent therewith, except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code.

 

(b) Cousins shall, with Parkways good faith cooperation and assistance,
prepare, execute and file, or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all
returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real
property transfer, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer,
recording, registration stamp or similar Taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") and Parkway and Cousins shall cooperate
to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. In addition, Parkway and Cousins shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize (i) the recognition of built-in gain under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.337(d)-7(b), and (ii) any state Taxes, in each case, imposed with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Parkway and Cousins shall take the actions described in Section
4.1(b)(xvi) of the Parkway Disclosure Letter. 

(d) At or prior to Closing, Parkway shall provide information reasonably
requested by Cousins regarding its good faith estimate of built-in gain

Parkway LP.

Section 5.14  _Financing_.

(a) Parkway will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable, to cause the Debt Financing to be consummated (including
by taking enforcement action to cause the Lenders to provide the Debt
Financing), or in the event any portion or all of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable (other than as a result of a material breach by Cousins of its
obligations under this Agreement) and subject to the following sentence,
alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, together with the
remaining Debt Financing, if any, and any other sources available to Parkway,
to provide net proceeds in an amount equal to or greater than the net proceeds
contemplated to be funded on the Closing Date by the Debt Commitment Letters
as of the date hereof) (any such alternate financing shall also be referred
to as a "Debt Financing" for purposes of this _Section 5.14_ and any
commitment letters or other documentation relating thereto shall also be
referred to as "Debt Commitment Letters" for purposes of this _Section
5.14_). Without the prior written consent of Cousins (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parkway shall not, and shall cause the
Borrower not to, consent or agree to any material amendment or modification
to, or any waiver of any material provision under, or any replacement of, the
Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing, or enter into any material agreement or arrangement with respect
to the Debt Financing (including in respect of any alternative financing)
that, in any case, taken as a whole, would be materially adverse to the
interests of Cousins, other than definitive agreements relating to the
Debt Financing as contemplated by (and substantially upon the express terms
set forth in, with such modifications as would not, taken as a whole, be
materially adverse to the interests of Cousins) the Debt Commitment Letters,
as in effect on the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt and without
limiting the foregoing, any amendment, modification, or replacement of or
waiver under any Debt Commitment Letter shall be deemed materially adverse to
the interests of Cousins if it (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the net
proceeds of the Debt Financing to be funded on the Closing Date, (ii) expands
the conditions or other contingencies relating to the receipt or funding of
the Debt Financing (whether by making any of such conditions or other
contingencies less likely to be satisfied on a timely basis or otherwise) or
imposes new or additional conditions or other contingencies relating to the
receipt or funding of the Debt Financing, or (iii) materially
adversely impacts the ability of Parkway or Borrower to enforce its rights
relating to the funding of the Debt Financing against any of the other parties
to the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the
Debt Financing. At Cousinss reasonable request from time to time, Parent
shall inform Cousins in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing; _provided_ that in no event will Parkway be under
any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney-
client, attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parkway shall use its reasonable best efforts, including
entering into a common defense 

 



-58- ##### Table of Contents

  

 or common interest, or other similar agreement, to allow for such disclosure
to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-
client, attorney work product or other legal privilege).

(b) Without limiting _Section 5.14(a)_ hereof, consistent with applicable
Laws, (i) Cousins shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its and its Subsidiaries
respective Representatives to) provide to Parkway and its Subsidiaries such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parkway that is customary in
connection with the arranging, obtaining and syndication of the Debt
Financing, and (ii) Parkway shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its and
its Subsidiaries respective Representatives to) provide to Cousins and its
Subsidiaries such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Cousins that
is customary in connection with the arranging, obtaining and syndication of
such financing arrangements (including, without limitation, amendments,
supplements, modifications, refinancings, replacements, repayments or
prepayments of existing financing arrangements) as Cousins may determine
necessary or advisable in connection with the completion of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby or with the financing of Cousins and
its Subsidiaries and joint ventures (including the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries and joint ventures) at and following the Effective Time
(such financing described in this clause (ii), the " _Cousins Financing_ ",
and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "), including, with
respect to the Debt Financing (in the case of Cousins) and with respect to
the Cousins Financing (in the case of Parkway): (i) participating in, and
assisting with, marketing efforts relating to such Financing, including
assisting in the preparation of customary confidential information
memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda and
other customary offering documents and marketing materials; (ii) assisting in
the preparation of rating agency presentations and attending and participating
in meetings with rating agencies, roadshows, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and meetings with prospective lenders and debt investors, in each
case, at such times as coordinated reasonably in advance thereof; (iii)
delivery of documentation and other information reasonably requested by
sources of such Financing with respect to (x) applicable "know-your-customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and
(y) the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control and the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; (iv) delivery of financial information
customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of the Financing,
including in connection with the preparation of customary confidential
information memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses, offering
memoranda and other customary offering or information documents to be used for
such Financing (which financial information, for the avoidance of doubt, may
be included in any such confidential information memoranda, private placement
memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda and other offering or information
documents used for or distributed in connection with the Financing); (v)
directing their respective independent auditors to cooperate with such
Financing consistent with their customary practice; (vi) assisting with the
preparation of pro forma financial information and pro forma financial
statements; (vii) preparing customary projections, estimates and other
forward looking financial information regarding the future performance of such
party; and (viii) executing and delivering such definitive financing
documents, including certificates, credit agreements and other documents, as
may be reasonably necessary to facilitate such Financing, in each case in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the party executing such document.
Each of Cousins and Parkway hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing, _provided_ that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely
to harm or disparage such party or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of such party or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any other
provision set forth herein or in any other agreement between Cousins and
Parkway or its affiliates, the parties hereto agree that such parties may
share with the sources of such Financing customary projections and other
confidential information with respect to Cousins, Parkway and their
Subsidiaries after giving effect to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, with respect to Parkway
and Cousins and their Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) that the parties
have cooperated in preparing, and that Parkway, Cousins, their Subsidiaries
and such sources of Financing may share information about Parkway, Cousins
and their Subsidiaries (notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in
the Confidentiality Agreement) with potential sources of the Financing in
connection with any marketing efforts in connection with the
Financing, provided that the recipients of such information agree to
customary confidentiality agreements.

Subsidiaries (in the case of the Debt Financing) or Parkway or
its Subsidiaries (in the case of the Cousins Financing) or require any of
them to take any actions that would reasonably be expected to violate

this Agreement.

(d) Cousins and Parkway shall reasonably cooperate (i) to obtain customary

in connection with any repayment or redemption of such Indebtedness in
connection with the Merger and (ii) to make arrangements for such holders of
Indebtedness (or their agents or trustees) to deliver to Cousins, subject to
the prior receipt of the applicable payoff amounts, releases of all related
Liens and terminations of all related guarantees at, and subject to the

advisable under Law to effect each of the Asset Sales, in one transaction or

the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date, and (iii) the
other representations and warranties of Parkway set forth in this Agreement

(iii) In the event that (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have

management or Board of Directors of Cousins and publicly announced, (B)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated (1) by Cousins or Parkway pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(c)_ (if the Cousins Required Vote has not theretofore been
obtained) or _Section 7.1(i)_ or (2) by Parkway pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_
and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, Cousins consummates a transaction of a type set forth in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" or enters into an Acquisition Agreement,
then Cousins shall, on the date such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, pay
to Parkway a onetime fee equal to the Cousins Termination Fee less the amount

pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)(iii)_ ( _provided_ that, for purposes of this

"65%").

 

(iv) In the event that Parkway or Cousins terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(i)_ under circumstances in which the Cousins Termination Fee
is not then payable, then Cousins shall pay to Parkway a onetime fee equal to
the Parkway Expense Reimbursement; _provided_ that the payment by Cousins of

(d) In no event shall this _Section 7.2_ require (i) Parkway to pay the
Parkway Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (ii) Cousins to pay the

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either Parkway or Cousins fails to
pay all amounts due to the other party under this _Section 7.2_ on the dates
specified, then either Parkway or Cousins, as applicable, shall pay all costs
and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by such other party
in connection with any action or proceeding (including the filing of any
lawsuit) taken by it to collect such unpaid amounts, together with interest on
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date actually received by such other party. Each
of the parties hereto acknowledges that each of the Cousins Expense
Reimbursement, Parkway Expense Reimbursement, Cousins Termination Fee and
Parkway Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate a party in the circumstances in which
such amounts are due and payable, which amounts would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision

(f) The " _Parkway Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the Parkway Base Amount (as defined below) and (ii) the maximum amount,
if any, that can be paid to Cousins without causing it to fail to meet the

Requirements_ ") for such year determined as if (a) the payment of such amount
did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (b) Cousins has 0.5% of its gross
income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known or anticipated income of Cousins which was not
Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by independent accountants to
Cousins. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Cousins receives
Tax Guidance providing that Cousinss receipt of the Parkway Base Amount
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Parkway Termination
Fee shall be an amount equal to the Parkway Base Amount and Parkway shall,
upon receiving notice that Cousins has received the Tax Guidance, pay to
Cousins the unpaid Parkway Base Amount within five (5) Business Days. In the
event that Cousins is not able to receive the full Parkway Base Amount due to
the above limitations, Parkway shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire
transfer within three (3) days of termination and shall not release any
portion thereof to Cousins unless and until Cousins receives either one or a
combination of the following once or more often: (i) a letter from Cousinss
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that
time to Cousins without causing Cousins to fail to meet the REIT Requirements
(calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance, in either of which
events Parkway shall pay to Cousins the lesser of the unpaid Parkway Base
Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above
within five (5) Business Days after Parkway has been notified thereof. The
obligation of

Cousins Expense Reimbursement Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT
Requirements, the Cousins Expense Reimbursement shall be an amount equal to

EXHIBIT B

 

REORGANIZATION STEPS PLAN

 

Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit B and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
Agreement of which this Exhibit B is a part.

The transaction steps listed hereunder shall, unless otherwise indicated,
occur in accordance with the order listed herein (e.g., the transactions
described in Section 1 shall be completed before the transactions described in
Section 2 and the transactions described in each subsection of a Section shall
occur in the order listed, so that Section 3(a) shall be completed before the
transactions described in Section 3(b)).

By mutual agreement, the parties may modify the steps set forth in this
Exhibit B to facilitate the contemplated financing and repayment of
indebtedness and to achieve the parties objectives in the most efficient
manner.

 



     | 1. | Preliminary Matters 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | Prior to the filing with the SEC of a registration statement
on Form 10 and the related Houston Distribution Prospectus relating to the
Distribution of shares of common stock of HoustonCo, Parkway shall organize a
new Maryland corporation that will be HoustonCo. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | HoustonCos charter will provide for three classes of stock:
voting common stock, non-voting preferred stock, and limited voting stock (the
" _HoustonCo Limited Voting Stock_ "). The terms of the HoustonCo Limited
Voting Stock will be substantially identical to the terms of the Cousins
Limited Voting Preferred Stock set forth in _Exhibit E_ to the Merger
Agreement. Upon formation, HoustonCo will issue to Parkway, for
nominal consideration, 1,000 shares of voting common stock. The non-voting
preferred stock will have a liquidation preference of $5 million, and will be
entitled to dividends at a "market rate," to be set at the time of the
transactions (the "HoustonCo Non-Voting Preferred Stock"). 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | At all times prior to the distribution of cash contemplated
in Paragraph 4, HoustonCo is intended to be a "qualified REIT subsidiary" of
Parkway (and, following the Effective Time, Cousins) within the meaning of
Section 856(i)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Immediately prior to the distribution of cash contemplated in Paragraph 4,
Cousins will cause the HoustonCo Non-Voting Preferred Stock to be issued to
Cousins LP, in exchange for a capital contribution of $5 million in cash, so
as to cause HoustonCo to be regarded as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes that is not a "qualified REIT subsidiary." 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Prior to the Effective Time, Parkway and Parkway LP shall
organize two new Delaware limited partnerships, for each of which Parkway will
be the initial general partner and Parkway LP will be the initial limited
partner.  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | One limited partnership is referred to in this Exhibit B as
"Cousins LP" and will become the operating partnership of Cousins following
the completion of the Reorganization. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | The other limited partnership is referred to as "Houston
Sub LP," which will be a direct and indirect subsidiary of HoustonCo following
the completion of the Reorganization. Parkway GP will be the general partner
of Houston Sub LP, with a nominal economic interest as general partner. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Promptly following the later to occur of (i) the approval of the Cousins
Required Vote and Parkway Required Stockholders Vote by the shareholders of
Cousins and Parkway at the Cousins Stockholders Meeting and the Parkway
Stockholders Meeting, respectively, and (ii) the completion of the SECs
review of the Houston Distribution Prospectus, and confirmation by each 

---|---|--- ##### Table of Contents

       |  of Cousins and Parkway that the conditions to Closing have
then been satisfied, other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to
be satisfied at the Closing, Cousins will declare a distribution, to the
holders of record of Cousins Common Stock and Cousins Limited Voting Preferred
Stock immediately following the Effective Time, consisting of one share of
HoustonCo voting common stock for each share of Cousins Common Stock and one
share of HoustonCo Limited Voting Stock for each share of Cousins Limited
Voting Preferred Stock (as such distribution ratio may be adjusted in
accordance with Schedule 1 attached hereto), payment of which distribution
will be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger and shall occur on the
business day following the Closing Date. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | As a result of the consummation of the Merger, the number of
outstanding Parkway Partnership Common Units will be recapitalized based on
the Merger exchange ratio, as indicated on Schedule 1 attached hereto.  
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | Division of Parkway LP 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | Immediately following the Effective Time, Parkway LP will
contribute to Cousins LP the following assets: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | its direct and indirect ownership interests in all of its
Subsidiaries that own real property other than (A) the Subsidiaries that own
direct or indirect ownership interests in CityWest Place, Phoenix Tower,
and San Felipe Plaza (the "Parkway Houston Properties") and (B) the direct or
indirect minority ownership interest of Parkway LP in 2121 Market Street
Associates, L.P.; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | the other assets of Parkway contemplated to be owned by
Cousins and its subsidiaries in the Separation and Distribution Agreement
provided for in _Exhibit C_ to the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 

In addition, Cousins LP will assume, or acquire the foregoing assets subject
to, the liabilities contemplated to be assumed or borne by Cousins LP and its
Subsidiaries in the Separation and Distribution Agreement provided for in
_Exhibit C_ to the Merger Agreement. In exchange for these contributions,
Parkway LP will receive a number of limited partner common units of
Cousins LP as set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto. Following the
foregoing contributions to Cousins LP, Parkway LP will own the following
assets (the "Parkway Houston Assets"), in addition to its interest in Cousins
LP:

 



     | (iii) | 100% of the ownership interests in subsidiaries that own
the Parkway Houston Properties; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | the direct and indirect ownership interest in Eola Office
Partners LLC, including the third party management contracts owned to which it
or its Subsidiaries are a party, as set forth on Schedule 2 hereto;  
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | the direct and indirect minority ownership interest of
Parkway LP in 2121 Market Street Associates, L.P.; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | the other assets of Parkway contemplated to be owned by
HoustonCo and its subsidiaries in the Separation and Distribution Agreement
provided for in _Exhibit C_ to the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Parkway LP will distribute 100% of its limited partner
interests in Cousins LP ratably to its partners in accordance with the Parkway
Partnership Agreement, as indicated on Schedule 1 attached hereto (so that
each Parkway unitholder receives the same number of units in Cousins LP as
the number of units that it owns in Parkway LP). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Parkway Properties General Partners, Inc. ("Parkway GP")
will distribute to Merger Sub, which is its sole shareholder, all of the units
in Cousins LP that Parkway GP received in the distribution by Parkway LP in
Step 2(c). 
---|---|---

       | 3. | Contribution of Assets to Houston Sub LP and HoustonCo 
---|---|--- 

Immediately following the distribution of limited partner interests in
Cousins LP to the partners of Parkway LP, on the Closing Date 



     | (a) | Parkway LP will contribute the Parkway Houston Assets to
Houston Sub LP in exchange for limited partner interests, as set forth on
Schedule 1 attached hereto. Houston Sub LP will assume, or acquire the
foregoing assets subject to, the liabilities contemplated to be assumed or
borne by Houston Sub LP and its Subsidiaries in the Separation and
Distribution Agreement provided for in _Exhibit C_ to the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Cousins will contribute its direct and indirect ownership

set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Greenway Plaza 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Post Oak Central 
---|---|--- 

In addition, Cousins will contribute the other Cousins assets contemplated to
be owned by HoustonCo and its subsidiaries in the Separation and Distribution
Agreement provided for in _Exhibit C_ to the Merger Agreement. Houston Sub LP
will assume, or acquire the foregoing assets subject to, the liabilities
contemplated to be assumed or borne by Houston Sub LP and its Subsidiaries in
the Separation and Distribution Agreement provided for in _Exhibit C_ to the
Merger Agreement.

 

Cousins will retain direct or indirect ownership of a 1% non-managing limited
liability company interest (or 1% general partner interest, as applicable)
(each a "Retained 1% Houston Property Interest") in each of its Subsidiaries
that owns an interest in the Cousins Houston Properties and is treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a disregarded entity.



     | (c) | Cousins will contribute the following assets to HoustonCo in
exchange for shares of HoustonCo common stock, as set forth on Schedule 1
attached hereto: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | its limited partner interest in Houston Sub LP 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Retained 1% Houston Property Interests. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Merger Sub will contribute to HoustonCo its limited partner
interest in Parkway LP and its stock in Parkway GP in exchange for shares of
HoustonCo common stock, as set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto.  
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Merger Sub will contribute to Parkway GP its general partner
interest in Houston Sub LP. 
---|---|--- 



     | 4. | Houston Credit Facility and Cash Distributions 
---|---|--- 

Immediately following the foregoing steps, on the Closing Date



     | (a) | Houston Sub LP will enter into a credit facility, which is
contemplated to provide aggregate availability of at least $350 million.
Subject to satisfaction of the conditions to borrowing thereunder, Houston Sub
LP will make a draw under the Credit Facility. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Houston Sub LP will distribute a pro rata portion of $200
million of the loan proceeds to Parkway LP. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Cousins LP will contribute $5 million to HoustonCo in
exchange for HoustonCo Non-Voting Preferred Stock so as to cause HoustonCo to
be regarded as a corporation for federal income tax purposes that is not
a "qualified REIT subsidiary." 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | HoustonCo will contribute $5 million to Parkway LP in
exchange for preferred limited partner units with an aggregate liquidation
preference of $5 million and bearing a market dividend rate, i.e., on terms
that otherwise mirror the terms of the HoustonCo Non-Voting Preferred Stock
(the " _Parkway LP Preferred Units_ "). 
---|---|--- 
 



3 ##### Table of Contents

       | (e) | Parkway LP will contribute $5 million to Houston Sub LP
in exchange for preferred limited partner units with an aggregate liquidation
preference of $5 million and bearing a market dividend rate (the " _Houston
Sub Preferred Units_ "). 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Houston Sub LP will distribute the portion of the $200
million in loan proceeds remaining after the distribution in Step 4(b) ratably
to HoustonCo and Parkway GP, which are its other partners. Parkway GP will
distribute the cash it receives to HoustonCo, which is its sole stockholder.
Parkway LP will distribute its share of the $200 million in loan proceeds
previously received from Houston Sub LP in one of the following manners: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | a ratable distribution to each of its partners, if each of
its partners agrees to cause its share of the distributed cash to be
contributed to Cousins LP in exchange for limited partner interests in Cousins
LP (see Step 5(b) below); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if each of its partners does not agree to cause its share
of the distributed cash to be contributed to Cousins LP in exchange for
limited partner interests in Cousins LP (see Step 5(b) below), to redeem
Parkway Partnership Common Units held by HoustonCo and each other partner
that agrees to cause its share of the distributed cash to be contributed to
Cousins LP in exchange for limited partner interests in Cousins LP (see Step
5(b) below) at a redemption price per Parkway Partnership Common Unit based
on the "Cash Amount" determined in accordance with the redemption provisions
of the Parkway LP partnership agreement. If this alternative is used, the
outstanding units of Parkway LP will be adjusted proportionately with the
goal that (x) the total number of outstanding units of Parkway LP equals the
number of units of Houston Sub LP held by Parkway LP and (y) the sum of the
number of (I) Parkway LP units held by HoustonCo and Parkway GP plus (II)
Houston Sub LP units held by HoustonCo equals the number of outstanding shares
of voting common stock of Cousins. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | Parkway GP will distribute to HoustonCo its share of the
cash that it has received in Step 4(f). 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | HoustonCo will distribute to Merger Sub, which will
distribute to Cousins, the cash distributions that is has received in Steps
4(e) and 4(f). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 5. | Contribution of Cousins Assets to Cousins LP 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | Cousins will contribute all of its remaining assets (other
than the common stock of HoustonCo, the stock of Merger Sub and any assets for
which consents for transfer are necessary and still pending), including the
cash it received from the distribution/redemption by Parkway LP in Step 4(g),
to Cousins LP in exchange for the number of limited partner units in Cousins
LP set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto. Cousins LP will assume, or acquire
the foregoing assets subject to, the liabilities contemplated to be assumed
or borne by Cousins LP and its Subsidiaries in the Separation and Distribution
Agreement provided for in Exhibit C to the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Parkway LP unitholders will contribute the cash they
received from the distribution/redemption by Parkway LP in Step 4(e) to
Cousins LP in exchange for the number of limited partner units in Cousins LP
set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The Cousins LP units issued in exchange for contributions of
cash will be valued based on the good faith estimate by the general partner of
Cousins LP of what the value of a share of Cousins common stock will be
when trading begins following the Distribution. In allocating the units in
Cousins LP, the goal will be to have (i) the total number of Cousins LP units
to be issued to Cousins and Merger Sub as the general partner of Cousins LP
equal (ii) the total number of shares of Cousins voting common stock to be
outstanding immediately following the Distribution. 
---|---|---

       | 6. | Distribution of HoustonCo Shares to Cousins Shareholders 
---|---|---

     | (a) | Merger Sub will distribute to Cousins, as its sole
shareholder, 100% of the common stock of HoustonCo, 100% of the HoustonCo
Limited Voting Stock, the general partner interest in Cousins LP, and all of
the limited partner interests in Cousins LP that Merger Sub received in the
distributions from Parkway LP and Parkway GP. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Cousins will distribute 100% of the voting common stock of
HoustonCo and 100% of the HoustonCo Limited Voting Stock to the persons who
are holders of Cousins common stock and Cousins Limited Voting Stock,
respectively, in accordance with the terms of the dividend declaration
described above. Cousins LP will retain the HoustonCo Non-Voting Preferred
Stock.

SCHEDULE 1

 

SCHEDULE 1

EQUITY CAPITALIZATION STEPS PLAN

This Schedule 1 sets out the methodology for determining the number of shares
of common stock, amount of preferred stock, and limited partnership units to
be issued by Cousins, Parkway LP, Cousins LP, Houston Sub LP, and HoustonCo in
the various steps of the Reorganization Steps Plan to which this Schedule 1 is
attached. The information under "Capitalization Prior to Effective Time" will
be updated immediately prior to the Effective Time to reflect any changes from
the date of the Merger Agreement and to reflect the Estimated Cousins Share
Value for Cash Consideration. The methodology will not be revised without the
mutual consent of Cousins and Parkway.

This Schedule 1 does not address the treatment of outstanding equity awards in
the Merger and Reorganization. In general, equity awards that vest and for
which common stock or partnership units are issued as a result of the Merger
will be treated in the same manner as other outstanding shares of common stock
and partnership units. This Schedule 1 also does not address the treatment of
limited voting shares. Generally, they will be treated in the same manner as
common stock.

  Employee Matters |  |  

 The parties will enter into an Employee Matters Agreement that will
address the following topics, among other customary topics, in a manner
substantially similar to the provisions in Section 5.6 of the Merger
Agreement:



 

 Initial post-Distribution Date continued employment terms

 



 

 Treatment of benefit plans

 



 

 Treatment of equity incentive plans

 



 

 Benefit Continuation  Initial post-Distribution Date employment terms
for Parkway and Cousins employees transferring to HoustonCo generally will be
consistent with those applicable to continuing Parkway employees under Section
5.6(a)-(b) of the Merger Agreement, it being understood that legacy Cousins
employees shall be treated no less favorably than legacy Parkway employees
and that the Parkway Separation Pay Plan shall apply to both legacy Cousins
and legacy Parkway employees transferring to HoustonCo.

 



 

 Allocation of Assets and Liabilities  Cousins generally will retain
assets and liabilities related to benefit plans and employees who are not
transferring to HoustonCo. HoustonCo generally will assume assets and
liabilities related to benefit plans and employees who are transferring to
HoustonCo. Notwithstanding the foregoing, liability for claims incurred under
a health and welfare benefit plan prior to the distribution shall remain the
liability of the party who sponsors such benefit plan following the
distribution. In addition, Cousins shall, with respect to employees who do
not transfer to HoustonCo, pay any severance obligations owed pursuant to the
terms of the existing employment agreements, change in control agreements and
the Parkway Separation Pay Plan.

 



 

 Treatment of Legacy Parkway Equity Awards 

 



 

Ø No Parkway Partnership LTIP Units shall be outstanding following the
Closing.



 

Ø Parkway RSU Awards shall be treated as set forth in Section 2.5(b) of
the Merger Agreement, some of which no longer shall be outstanding following
the Closing. With respect to Parkway RSU Awards that remain unvested as of the
Closing, in connection with the Houston Distribution the following provisions
shall apply:



 

¡  For legacy Parkway employees who are transferring to HoustonCo,
the Parkway RSU Awards that converted into Cousins RSU Awards under the Merger
Agreement shall be converted into, or exchanged for, restricted stock units
covering the common stock of HoustonCo, as adjusted for the Houston
Distribution, under terms and conditions substantially similar to the terms
applicable to the Parkway RSU Awards as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.



¡ For legacy Parkway employees who do not transfer to HoustonCo but
will not be offered a long-term position with Cousins, the Parkway RSU Awards
that converted into Cousins RSU Awards under the Merger Agreement shall be
divided on a proportional basis into (i) fully vested Parkway RSU Awards and
(ii) fully vested restricted stock units covering the common stock of
HoustonCo, in each case as adjusted for the Houston Distribution.



 

¡  For legacy Parkway employees who do not transfer to HoustonCo, the
Parkway RSU Awards that converted into Cousins RSU Awards under the Merger
Agreement shall remain awards fully denominated in Cousins Common Stock, with
the number of shares adjusted to reflect the Houston Distribution.

will not be offered a long-term position with Cousins, the Cousins Stock
Options shall be divided on a proportional basis into (i) fully vested stock
options covering Cousins Common Stock and (ii) fully vested stock options

remaining term of such stock option and as adjusted for the Houston

commercially reasonable estimate of the amount that would be realized by the
Partnership if each asset of the Partnership (and each asset of each
partnership, limited liability company, trust, joint venture or other entity
in which the Partnership owns a direct or indirect interest) were sold to an
unrelated purchaser in an arms length transaction where neither the purchaser
nor the seller were under economic compulsion to enter into the transaction
(without regard to any discount in value as a result of the Partnerships
minority interest in any property or any illiquidity of the Partnerships
interest in any property).

" _Vested LTIP Units_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section 4.6.C_.

 

" _Vesting Agreement_ " means each or any, as the context implies, agreement
or instrument entered into by a holder of LTIP Units upon acceptance of an
award of LTIP Units under an Equity Incentive Plan.

partnership organized pursuant to the Act; (ii) to enter into any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, limited liability company or other similar
arrangement to engage in any of the foregoing or the ownership of interests
in any entity engaged, directly or indirectly, in any of the foregoing; and
(iii) to do anything necessary or incidental to the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any business shall be limited to and conducted in such a
manner as to permit the General Partner and, if different, the General Partner
Entity, at all times to be classified as a REIT, unless the General Partner or
General Partner Entity, as applicable, in its sole and absolute discretion
has chosen to cease to qualify as a REIT or has chosen not to attempt to
qualify as a REIT for any reason or reasons whether or not related to the
business conducted by the Partnership. In connection with the foregoing,
and without limiting the General Partner or the General Partner Entitys
right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to cease qualifying as a REIT, the

their or its Affiliates, members and shareholders. The General Partner shall

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCES

OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS



   Section 4.1 | Capital Contributions of the Partners 
---|--- 

Prior to or concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Partners
have made the Capital Contributions as set forth in the Partner Registry. On
the date hereof, the Partners own Partnership Units in the amounts set forth
in the Partner Registry and have Percentage Interests in the Partnership as
set forth in the Partner Registry. The number of Partnership Units and
Percentage Interest shall be adjusted in the Partner Registry from time to
time by the General Partner to the extent necessary to reflect accurately
exchanges, redemptions, Capital Contributions, the issuance of additional
Partnership Units or similar events having an effect on a Partners Percentage
Interest occurring after the date hereof in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. One thousand (1,000) Partnership Units shall be deemed to be the
General Partners Partnership Units and shall be the General Partner Interest
of the General Partner, and all other Partnership Units held by the General
Partner shall be deemed to be Limited Partner Interests and shall be held by
the General Partner in its capacity as a Limited Partner in the Partnership.
Except as provided in _Sections 7.5_ and _10.5_ hereof, the Partners shall
have no obligation to make any additional Capital Contributions or provide
any additional funding to the Partnership (whether in the form of loans,
repayments of loans or otherwise). No Partner shall have any obligation to
restore any deficit that may exist in its Capital Account, either upon a
liquidation of the Partnership or otherwise, provided that such Capital
Account deficit did not arise by reason of distributions in violation of this
Agreement or applicable law or other actions in violation of this Agreement or
applicable law. 



   Section 4.2 | Issuances of Partnership Interests 
---|--- 

A. _General_. The General Partner is hereby authorized to cause the
Partnership from time to time to issue to Partners (including the General
Partner and its Affiliates) or other Persons (including, without limitation,
in connection with the contribution of property to the Partnership or any of
its Subsidiaries) Partnership Units or other Partnership Interests in one or
more classes, or in one or more series of any of such classes, with such
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights, powers and duties, including rights, powers and duties senior
to one or more other classes of Partnership Interests, all as shall be
determined, subject to applicable Delaware law, by the General Partner in its
sole and absolute discretion, including, without limitation, (i) the
allocations of items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
to each such class or series of Partnership Interests, (ii) the right of each
such class or series of Partnership Interests to share in Partnership
distributions, (iii) the rights of each such class or series of Partnership
Interests upon dissolution and

 



14 ##### Table of Contents

  

 liquidation of the Partnership, (iv) the rights, if any, of each such class
to vote on matters that require the vote or Consent of the Limited Partners,
and (v) the consideration, if any, to be received by the Partnership;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such Partnership Units or other Partnership
Interests shall be issued to the General Partner Entity unless either (a) the
Partnership Interests are issued in connection with the grant, award or
issuance of Shares or other equity interests in the General Partner Entity
(including a transaction described in _Section 7.5.F_ ) having designations,
preferences and other rights such that the economic interests attributable to
such Shares or other equity interests are substantially similar to the
designations, preferences and other rights (except voting rights) of the
Partnership Interests issued to the General Partner Entity in accordance with
this  _Section 4.2.A_ , or (b) the additional Partnership Interests are
issued to all Partners holding Partnership Interests in the same class in
proportion to their respective Percentage Interests in such class. If the
Partnership issues Partnership Interests pursuant to this _Section 4.2.A_ ,
the General Partner shall make such revisions to this Agreement (including but
not limited to the revisions described in _Section 5.5_ , _Section 6.2_ and
_Section 8.6_ ) as it deems necessary to reflect the issuance of such
Partnership Interests.

B. _Classes of Partnership Units_. From and after the date of the Agreement,
the Partnership shall have three classes of Partnership Units entitled "Class
A Units," "Class B Units" and "LTIP Units," and such additional classes of
Partnership Units as may be created by the General Partner pursuant to
_Section 4.2.A_ (collectively, the " _Units_ "). Class A Units, Class B Units,
LTIP Units or a class of Partnership Interests created pursuant to _Section
4.2.A_, at the election of the General Partner, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may be issued to newly admitted Partners in exchange for the
contribution by such Partners of cash, real estate partnership interests,
stock, notes or other assets or consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any Partnership Unit that is not specifically designated by the General
Partner as being of a particular class shall be deemed to be a Class A Unit.
Each Class B Unit shall be converted automatically into a corresponding
series of Class A Unit on the day immediately following the Partnership Record
Date for the Distribution Period in which such Class B Unit was issued,
without the requirement for any action by the General Partner, the
Partnership or the Partner holding the Class B Unit. The terms of the LTIP
Units shall be in accordance with _Sections 4.6_ and _4.7_.



    Section 4.3 | No Preemptive Rights 
---|--- 

Except to the extent expressly granted by the Partnership pursuant to
another Agreement, no Person shall have any preemptive, preferential or other
similar right with respect to (i) additional Capital Contributions or loans to
the Partnership or (ii) issuance or sale of any Partnership Units or other
Partnership Interests. 



   Section 4.4 | Other Contribution Provisions 
---|--- 

A. _General_. If any Partner is admitted to the Partnership and is given a
Capital Account in exchange for services rendered to the Partnership, such
transaction shall be treated by the Partnership and the affected Partner as if
the Partnership had compensated such Partner in cash, and the Partner had
made a Capital Contribution of such cash to the capital of the Partnership.

B. _Mergers_. To the extent the Partnership acquires any property (or an
indirect interest therein) by the merger of any other Person into the
Partnership or with or into a Subsidiary of the Partnership, Persons who
receive Partnership Interests in exchange for their interest in the
Person merging into the Partnership or with or into a Subsidiary of the
Partnership shall be deemed to have been admitted as Additional Limited
Partners pursuant to _Section 12.2_ and shall be deemed to have made Capital
Contributions as provided in the applicable merger agreement (or if not so
provided, as determined by the General Partner in its sole and absolute
discretion) and as set forth in the Partner Registry.



   Section 4.5 | No Interest on Capital 
---|--- 

No Partner shall be entitled to interest on its Capital Contributions or
its Capital Account.

 



15 ##### Table of Contents

     Section 4.6 | LTIP Units 
---|--- 

A. _Issuance of LTIP Units_. The General Partner may from time to time issue
LTIP Units to Persons who have provided, or will provide, services to the
Partnership or the General Partner, for such consideration (if any) as the
General Partner may determine to be appropriate, and admit such Persons as
Limited Partners. Subject to the following provisions of this _Section 4.6_
and the special provisions of _Sections 4.7_ and 6.1.E, LTIP Units shall be
treated as Class A Units, with all of the rights, privileges and obligations
attendant thereto (or, if so designated by the General Partner in connection
with the issuance thereof, as Class B Units for the quarter in which such LTIP
Units are issued). For purposes of computing the Partners Percentage
Interests, holders of LTIP Units shall be treated as Class A Unit holders and
LTIP Units shall be treated as Class A Units. In particular, the Partnership
shall maintain at all times a one-to-one correspondence between LTIP Units and
Class A Units for conversion, distribution and other purposes, including,
without limitation, complying with the following procedures:

(i) If an Adjustment Event occurs, then the General Partner shall make a
corresponding adjustment to the LTIP Units to maintain a one-for-one
conversion and economic equivalence ratio between Class A Units and LTIP
Units. If more than one Adjustment Event occurs, the adjustment to the LTIP
Units need be made only once using a single formula that takes into account
each and every Adjustment Event as if all Adjustment Events occurred
simultaneously. If the Partnership takes an action affecting the Class A Units
other than actions specifically defined as "Adjustment Events" and in the
opinion of the General Partner such action would require an adjustment to the
LTIP Units to maintain the one-to-one correspondence described above, the
General Partner shall have the right to make such adjustment to the LTIP
Units, to the extent permitted by law and by any applicable Equity Incentive
Plan, in such manner and at such time as the General Partner, in its sole
discretion, may determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. If an
adjustment is made to the LTIP Units, as herein provided, the Partnership
shall promptly file in the books and records of the Partnership an officers
certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts
requiring such adjustment, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence of
the correctness of such adjustment absent manifest error. Promptly after
filing of such certificate, the Partnership shall mail a notice to each LTIP
Unitholder setting forth the adjustment to his or her LTIP Units and the
effective date of such adjustment; and

(ii) Subject to the provisions of _Sections 5.1.E_ , _5.1.F_ and _5.1.G_ ,
the LTIP Unitholders shall, when, as and if authorized and declared by the
General Partner out of assets legally available for that purpose, be entitled
to receive distributions in an amount per LTIP Unit equal to the
distributions per Class A Unit paid to holders of Class A Units on such
Partnership Record Date established by the General Partner with respect to
such distribution. So long as any LTIP Units are outstanding, no
distributions (whether in cash or in kind) shall be authorized, declared or
paid on Class A Units or Class B Units, unless equal distributions have been
or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid on the LTIP Units that
are then entitled to payment of distributions.

B. _Priority_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 4.6_ and the special
provisions of _Sections 4.7_ , _5.1.E_ , _5.1.F_ and _5.1.G_ , the LTIP Units
shall rank pari passu with the Class A Units and Class B Units as to the
payment of regular and special periodic or other distributions and
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As to the
payment of distributions and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, any class or series of Partnership Units which by
its terms specifies that it shall rank junior to, on a parity with, or senior
to the Class A Units shall also rank junior to, or pari passu with, or senior
to, as the case may be, the LTIP Units. Subject to the terms of any Vesting
Agreement, an LTIP Unitholder shall be entitled to transfer his or her LTIP
Units to the same extent, and subject to the same restrictions as holders of
Class A Units are entitled to transfer their Class A Units pursuant to
_Article XI_.

 

C. _Special Provisions_. LTIP Units shall be subject to the following special
provisions:

 

(i) Vesting Agreements. LTIP Units may, in the sole discretion of the General
Partner, be issued subject to vesting, forfeiture and additional restrictions
on transfer pursuant to the terms of a Vesting Agreement. The terms of any
Vesting Agreement may be modified by the General Partner from time to time in
its sole

 



16 ##### Table of Contents

  

 discretion, subject to any restrictions on amendment imposed by the relevant
Vesting Agreement or by any applicable Equity Incentive Plan. LTIP Units that
have vested under the terms of a Vesting Agreement are referred to as "
_Vested LTIP Units_ "; all other LTIP Units shall be treated as " _Unvested
LTIP Units_."

 

(ii) Forfeiture. Unless otherwise specified in the Vesting Agreement, upon the
occurrence of any event specified in a Vesting Agreement as resulting in
either the right of the Partnership or the General Partner to repurchase LTIP
Units at a specified purchase price or some other forfeiture of any LTIP
Units, then if the Partnership or the General Partner exercises such right
to repurchase or such forfeiture occurs in accordance with the applicable
Vesting Agreement, the relevant LTIP Units shall immediately, and without any
further action, be treated as cancelled and no longer outstanding for any
purpose. Unless otherwise specified in the Vesting Agreement, no
consideration or other payment shall be due with respect to any LTIP Units
that have been forfeited, other than any distributions declared with respect
to a Partnership Record Date prior to the effective date of the forfeiture.
In connection with any repurchase or forfeiture of LTIP Units, the balance of
the portion of the Capital Account of the LTIP Unitholder that is attributable
to all of his or her LTIP Units shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by
which it exceeds the target balance contemplated by _Section 6.1.E_ hereof,
calculated with respect to the LTIP Unitholders remaining LTIP Units, if any.

 

(iii) Allocations. LTIP Unitholders shall be entitled to certain special
allocations of gain under _Section 6.1.E_. LTIP Units shall be allocated Net
Income and Net Loss, for any taxable year or portion of a taxable year
occurring after such issuance and prior to the Distribution Participation Date
for such LTIP Units, in amounts per LTIP Unit equal to the amounts
allocated per Class A Unit for the same period multiplied by the LTIP Unit
Sharing Percentage for such LTIP Units. Commencing with the portion of the
taxable year of the Partnership that begins on the Distribution Participation
Date established for any LTIP Units, such LTIP Units shall be allocated Net
Income and Net Loss in amounts per LTIP Unit equal to the amounts allocated
per Class A Unit. The allocations provided by the preceding sentence shall be
subject to _Section 6.1.A_ and  _Section 6.1.B_ of the Agreement. The General
Partner is authorized in its discretion to delay or accelerate the
participation of the LTIP Units in allocations of Net Income and Net Loss, or
to adjust the allocations made after the Distribution Participation Date, so
that the ratio of (i) the total amount of Net Income or Net Loss allocated
with respect to each LTIP Unit in the taxable year in which that LTIP Units
Distribution Participation Date falls, to (ii) the total amount distributed
to that LTIP Unit with respect to such period, is equal to such ratio as
computed for the Class A Units held by the General Partner.

 

(iv) Redemption. The Redemption Right provided to the holders of Class A Units
under _Section 8.6_ hereof shall not apply with respect to LTIP Units unless
and until they are converted to Class A Units as provided in clause (v) below
and _Section 4.7_.

(v) Conversion to Class A Units. Vested LTIP Units are eligible to be
converted into Class A Units in accordance with _Section 4.7_.

D.  _Voting_. LTIP Unitholders shall (a) have the same voting rights as the
Limited Partners, with the LTIP Units voting as a single class with the Class
A Units and having one vote per LTIP Unit; and (b) have the additional voting
rights that are expressly set forth below. So long as any LTIP Units remain
outstanding, the Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the LTIP Units outstanding at the time, given in
person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting separately as a
class), amend, alter or repeal, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise,
the provisions of this Agreement applicable to LTIP Units so as to materially
and adversely affect any right, privilege or voting power of the LTIP Units
or the LTIP Unitholders as such, unless such amendment, alteration, or repeal
affects equally, ratably and proportionately the rights, privileges and voting
powers of all of Class A Units (including the Class A Units held by the
General Partner); but subject, in any event, to the following provisions:

(i) With respect to any Class A Unit Transaction (as defined in _Section
4.7.F_ hereof), so long as the LTIP Units are treated in accordance with
_Section 4.7.F_ hereof, the consummation of such Class A Unit

 



17 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Transaction shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such
rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the LTIP Units or the LTIP
Unitholders as such; and

 

(ii) Any creation or issuance of any Partnership Units or of any class or
series of Partnership Interest in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, including, without limitation, additional Class A Units or
LTIP Units, whether ranking senior to, junior to, or on a parity with the LTIP
Units with respect to distributions and the distribution of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to materially and
adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the
LTIP Units or the LTIP Unitholders as such.

 

The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time
when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required will
be effected, all outstanding LTIP Units shall have been converted into Class
A Units.



   Section 4.7 | Conversion of LTIP Units. 
---|--- 

A. _Conversion Right_. An LTIP Unitholder shall have the right (the "
_Conversion Right_ "), at his or her option, at any time to convert all or a
portion of his or her Vested LTIP Units into fully paid and non-assessable
Class A Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that a holder may not exercise the
Conversion Right for fewer than one thousand (1,000) Vested LTIP Units or, if
such holder holds fewer than one thousand (1,000) Vested LTIP Units, all of
the Vested LTIP Units held by such holder. LTIP Unitholders shall not have
the right to convert Unvested LTIP Units into Class A Units until they become
Vested LTIP Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that when an LTIP Unitholder is
notified of the expected occurrence of an event that will cause his or
her Unvested LTIP Units to become Vested LTIP Units, such LTIP Unitholder may
give the Partnership a Conversion Notice conditioned upon and effective as of
the time of vesting and such Conversion Notice, unless subsequently revoked by
the LTIP Unitholder, shall be accepted by the Partnership subject to such
condition. The General Partner shall have the right at any time to cause a
conversion of Vested LTIP Units into Class A Units, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any Special LTIP Unit Distribution payable with respect to such Vested
LTIP Units is paid prior to such conversion. In all cases, the conversion of
any LTIP Units into Class A Units shall be subject to the conditions and
procedures set forth in this  _Section 4.7_.

B. _Exercise by an LTIP Unitholder_. A holder of Vested LTIP Units may convert
such LTIP Units into an equal number of fully paid and non-assessable Class A
Units, giving effect to all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to _Section
4.6_ hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may a holder of Vested
LTIP Units convert a number of Vested LTIP Units that exceeds (x) the
Economic Capital Account Balance of such Limited Partner, to the extent
attributable to its ownership of LTIP Units, divided by (y) the Class A Unit
Economic Balance, in each case as determined as of the effective date of
conversion (the " _Capital Account Limitation_ "). In order to exercise his or
her Conversion Right, an LTIP Unitholder shall deliver a notice (a "
_Conversion Notice_ ") in the form attached as _Exhibit E_ to this Agreement
to the Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) not less than ten (10)
nor more than sixty (60) days prior to a date (the " _Conversion Date_ ")
specified in such Conversion Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
General Partner has not given to the LTIP Unitholders notice of a proposed or
upcoming Class A Unit Transaction (as defined in _Section 4.7.F_ hereof) at
least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such Class A Unit
Transaction, then LTIP Unitholders shall have the right to deliver a
Conversion Notice until the earlier of (x) the tenth day after such notice
from the General Partner of a Class A Unit Transaction or (y) the third
business day immediately preceding the effective date of such Class A Unit
Transaction. A Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner provided in
_Section 15.1_. Each LTIP Unitholder covenants and agrees with
the Partnership that all Vested LTIP Units to be converted pursuant to this
_Section 4.7.B_ shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a holder of LTIP Units may
deliver a Notice of Redemption pursuant to _Section 8.6_ relating to those
Class A Units that will be issued to such holder upon conversion of such LTIP
Units into Class A Units in advance of the Conversion Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the redemption of such Class A Units by the Partnership
shall in no event take place until after the Conversion Date. For clarity, it
is noted that the objective of this paragraph is to put an LTIP Unitholder in
a position where, if he or she so wishes, the Class A Units into

 



18 ##### Table of Contents

  

 which his or her Vested LTIP Units will be converted can be redeemed by the
Partnership simultaneously with such conversion, with the further consequence
that, if the General Partner elects to assume and perform the Partnerships
redemption obligation with respect to such Class A Units under _Section 8.6_
hereof by delivering to such holder Shares rather than cash, then such holder
can have such Shares issued to him or her simultaneously with the conversion
of his or her Vested LTIP Units into Class A Units. The General Partner and
LTIP Unitholder shall reasonably cooperate with each other to coordinate the
timing of the events described in the foregoing sentence.

C. _Forced Conversion_. The Partnership, at any time at the election of the
General Partner, may cause any number of Vested LTIP Units held by an LTIP
Unitholder to be converted (a " _Forced Conversion_ ") into an equal number of
fully paid and non-assessable Class A Units, giving effect to all adjustments
(if any) made pursuant to _Section 4.6_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Partnership may not cause Forced Conversion of any LTIP Units that would not
at the time be eligible for conversion at the option of such LTIP Unitholder
pursuant to _Section 4.7.B_ or with respect to which a Special LTIP Unit
Distribution is payable and has not been paid. In order to exercise its right
of Forced Conversion, the Partnership shall deliver a notice (a " _Forced
Conversion Notice_ ") in the form attached as _Exhibit F_ to this Agreement
to the applicable LTIP Unitholder not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty
(60) days prior to the Conversion Date specified in such Forced Conversion
Notice. A Forced Conversion Notice shall be provided in the manner provided
in _Section 15.1_.

D. _Completion of Conversion_. A conversion of Vested LTIP Units for which
the holder thereof has given a Conversion Notice or the Partnership has given
a Forced Conversion Notice shall occur automatically after the close of
business on the applicable Conversion Date without any action on the part of
such LTIP Unitholder, as of which time such LTIP Unitholder shall be credited
on the books and records of the Partnership with the issuance as of the
opening of business on the next day of the number of Class A Units issuable
upon such conversion. After the conversion of LTIP Units as aforesaid, the
Partnership shall deliver to such LTIP Unitholder, upon his or her written
request, a certificate of the General Partner certifying the number of Class A
Units and remaining LTIP Units, if any, held by such person immediately after
such conversion. The Assignee of any Limited Partner pursuant to _Article XI_
hereof may exercise the rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this
_Section 4.7_ and such Limited Partner shall be bound by the exercise of such
rights by the Assignee.

E. _Impact of Conversions for Purposes of Section 6.1.E_. For purposes of
making future allocations under _Section 6.1.E_ hereof and applying the
Capital Account Limitation, the portion of the Economic Capital Account
Balance of the applicable LTIP Unitholder that is treated as attributable to
his or her LTIP Units shall be reduced, as of the date of conversion, by the
product of the number of LTIP Units converted and the Class A Unit Economic
Balance.

 

F. _Class A Unit Transactions_. If the Partnership or the General Partner
Entity shall be a party to any Class A Unit Transaction, then the General
Partner shall, immediately prior to the Class A Unit Transaction, exercise its
right to cause a Forced Conversion with respect to the maximum number of LTIP
Units then eligible for conversion, taking into account any allocations that
occur in connection with the Class A Unit Transaction or that would occur in
connection with the Class A Unit Transaction if the assets of the Partnership
were sold at the Class A Unit Transaction price or, if applicable, at a value
determined by the General Partner in good faith using the value attributed to
the Partnership Units in the context of the Class A Unit Transaction (in which
case the Conversion Date shall be the effective date of the Class A Unit
Transaction). In anticipation of such Forced Conversion and the consummation
of the Class A Unit Transaction, the Partnership shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each LTIP Unitholder to be afforded the right to
receive in connection with such Class A Unit Transaction in consideration for
the Class A Units into which his or her LTIP Units will be converted the same
kind and amount of cash, securities and other property (or any combination
thereof) receivable upon the consummation of such Class A Unit Transaction by
a holder of the same number of Class A Units, assuming such holder of Class A
Units is not a Person with which the Partnership consolidated or into which
the Partnership merged or which merged into the Partnership or to which
such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (a " _Constituent Person_
"), or an affiliate of a Constituent Person. In the event that holders of
Class A

 



19 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Units have the opportunity to elect the form or type of consideration to be
received upon consummation of the Class A Unit Transaction, prior to such
Class A Unit Transaction the General Partner shall give prompt written notice
to each LTIP Unitholder of such election, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to afford the LTIP Unitholders the right to elect, by
written notice to the General Partner, the form or type of consideration to
be received upon conversion of each LTIP Unit held by such holder into Class A
Units in connection with such Class A Unit Transaction. If an LTIP Unitholder
fails to make such an election, such holder (and any of its transferees) shall
receive upon conversion of each LTIP Unit held him or her (or by any of his
or her transferees) the same kind and amount of consideration that a holder of
a Class A Unit would receive if such Class A Unit holder failed to make such
an election. Subject to the rights of the Partnership and the General Partner
under any Vesting Agreement and any applicable Equity Incentive Plan, to the
extent any LTIP Units are then outstanding, the Partnership shall use
commercially reasonable effort to cause the terms of any Class A Unit
Transaction to be consistent with the provisions of this _Section 4.7.F_ and
to enter into an agreement with the successor or purchasing entity, as the
case may be, for the benefit of any LTIP Unitholders whose LTIP Units will
not be converted into Class A Units in connection with the Class A Unit
Transaction that will (i) contain provisions enabling the holders of LTIP
Units that remain outstanding after such Class A Unit Transaction to convert
their LTIP Units into securities as comparable as reasonably possible under
the circumstances to the Class A Units and (ii) preserve as far as reasonably
possible under the circumstances the distribution, special allocation,
conversion, and other rights set forth in this Agreement for the benefit of
the LTIP Unitholders.

DISTRIBUTIONS



   Section 5.1 | Requirement and Characterization of Distributions 
---|--- 

A. _Distribution of Operating Income_. The General Partner shall distribute
at least quarterly an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the
Available Cash of the Partnership with respect to such quarter or shorter
period to the Partners in accordance with the terms established for the class
or classes of Partnership Interests held by such Partners who are Partners on
the respective Partnership Record Date with respect to such quarter or shorter
period as provided in _Sections_ _5.1.B_ ,  _5.1.C_ and _5.1.D_ and in
accordance with the respective terms established for each class of Partnership
Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no
event may a Partner receive a distribution of Available Cash with respect to
a Partnership Unit for a quarter or shorter period if such Partner is entitled
to receive a distribution with respect to a Share for which such Partnership
Unit has been redeemed or exchanged. Unless otherwise expressly provided for
herein, or in the terms established for a new class or series of Partnership
Interests created in accordance with _Article IV_ hereof, no Partnership
Interest shall be entitled to a distribution in preference to any
other Partnership Interest. If the General Partner Entity has chosen to
attempt to qualify as a REIT, the General Partner shall make such reasonable
efforts, as determined by it in its sole and absolute discretion and
consistent with the qualification of the General Partner Entity as a REIT, to
distribute Available Cash to the General Partner Entity in an amount
sufficient to enable the General Partner Entity to make distributions to its
shareholders that will enable the General Partner Entity to (1) satisfy the
requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and the Regulations
(the " _REIT Requirements_ "), and (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax
liability.

 

B. _Method_.

(i) Each holder of Partnership Interests, if any, that is entitled to any
preference in distribution shall be entitled to a distribution in accordance
with the rights of any such class of Partnership Interests (and, within such
class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests on such
Partnership Record Date); and

(ii) To the extent there is Available Cash remaining after the payment of any
preference in distribution in accordance with the foregoing clause (i) (if
applicable), with respect to Partnership Interests that are not entitled to
any preference in distribution, such Available Cash shall be distributed
pro rata to each such class in

 



20 ##### Table of Contents

  

 accordance with the terms of such class (and, within each such class, pro
rata in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests on such Partnership
Record Date).

 

C. _Distributions When Class B Units Are Outstanding_. If for any quarter or
shorter period with respect to which a distribution is to be made pursuant to
_Section 5.1.A._ (a " _Distribution Period_ ") Class B Units are outstanding
on the Partnership Record Date for such Distribution Period, the General
Partner shall allocate the Available Cash with respect to such Distribution
Period available for distribution with respect to the Class A Units and Class
B Units collectively between the Partners who are holders of Class A Units ("
_Class A_ ") and the Partners who are holders of Class B Units (" _Class B_
") as follows:



     | (1) | Class A shall receive that portion of the Available Cash
(the " _Class A Share_ ") determined by multiplying the amount of Available
Cash by the following fraction: 
---|---|--- 
 



      
--- 
    

A x Y 

  (A x Y) + (B x X) 
 



     | (2) | Class B shall receive that portion of the Available Cash
(the " _Class B Share_ ") determined by multiplying the amount of Available
Cash by the following fraction: 
---|---|--- 
 



      
--- 
    

B x X 

  (A x Y) + (B x X) 
 



     | (3) | For purposes of the foregoing formulas, (i) "A" equals the
number of Class A Units outstanding on the Partnership Record Date for such
Distribution Period; (ii) "B" equals the number of Class B Units outstanding
on the Partnership Record Date for such Distribution Period; (iii) "Y" equals
the number of days in the Distribution Period; and (iv) "X" equals the number
of days in the Distribution Period for which the Class B Units were issued
and outstanding. 
---|---|--- 

The Class A Share shall be distributed pro rata among Partners holding Class A
Units on the Partnership Record Date for the Distribution Period in
accordance with the number of Class A Units held by each Partner on such
Partnership Record Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event may a
Partner receive a distribution of Available Cash with respect to a Class A
Unit if a Partner is entitled to receive a distribution with respect to a
Share for which such Class A Unit has been redeemed or exchanged. If Class B
Units were issued on the same date, the Class B Share shall be distributed
pro rata among the Partners holding Class B Units on the Partnership Record
Date for the Distribution Period in accordance with the number of Class B
Units held by each Partner on such Partnership Record Date. In no event shall
any Class B Units be entitled to receive any distribution of Available Cash
for any Distribution Period ending prior to the date on which such Class B
Units are issued. For purposes of the foregoing calculations, LTIP Units with
an associated Distribution Participation Date that falls on or before the
date of the relevant distribution shall be treated as outstanding Class A
Units.

 

D. _Distributions When Class B Units Have Been Issued on Different Dates_. If
Class B Units which have been issued on different dates are outstanding on
the Partnership Record Date for any Distribution Period, then the Class B
Units issued on each particular date shall be treated as a separate series of
Partnership Units for purposes of making the allocation of Available Cash for
such Distribution Period among the holders of Partnership Units (and the
formula for making such allocation, and the definitions of variables used
therein, shall be modified accordingly). Thus, for example, if two series of
Class B Units are outstanding on the Partnership Record Date for any
Distribution Period, the allocation formula for each series, " _Series B1_ "
and " _Series B2_ " would be as follows:

 



     | (1) | Series B1 shall receive that portion of the Available Cash
determined by multiplying the amount of Available Cash by the following
fraction: 
---|---|--- 
 



      
--- 
    

B1 x X1 

  (A x Y) + (B x X1) + (B2 x X2) 
  



21 ##### Table of Contents

       | (2) | Series B2 shall receive that portion of the Available
Cash determined by multiplying the amount of Available Cash by the following
fraction: 
---|---|--- 
 



      
--- 
    

B2 x X2 

  (A x Y) + (B1 x X1) + (B2 x X2) 
 



     | (3) | For purposes of the foregoing formulas the definitions set
forth in _Section 5.1.C(3)_ remain the same except that (i) "B1" equals the
number of Partnership Units in Series B1 outstanding on the Partnership
Record Date for such Distribution Period; (ii) "B2" equals the number of
Partnership Units in Series B2 outstanding on the Partnership Record Date for
such Distribution Period; (iii) "X1" equals the number of days in the
Distribution Period for which the Partnership Units in Series B1 were issued
and outstanding; and (iv) "X2" equals the number of days in the Distribution
Period for which the Partnership Units in Series B2 were issued and
outstanding.  
---|---|--- 

For purposes of the foregoing calculations, LTIP Units with an associated
Distribution Participation Date that falls on or before the date of the
relevant distribution shall be treated as outstanding Class A Units.

E. _Distributions With Respect to LTIP Units_. Commencing from the
Distribution Participation Date established for any LTIP Units, for any
quarterly or other period holders of such LTIP Units shall be entitled to
receive, if, when and as authorized by the General Partner out of funds
legally available for the payment of distributions, regular cash
distributions in an amount per unit equal to the distribution payable on each
Class A Unit for the corresponding quarterly or other period (the " _LTIP
Distribution Amount_ "). In addition, from and after the Distribution
Participation Date, LTIP Units shall be entitled to receive, if, when and as
authorized by the General Partner out of funds or other property legally
available for the payment of distributions, non-liquidating special,
extraordinary or other distributions in an amount per unit equal to the amount
of any non-liquidating special, extraordinary or other distributions payable
on the Class A Units which may be made from time to time. LTIP Units shall
also be entitled to receive, if, when and as authorized by the General Partner
out of funds or other property legally available for the payment of
distributions, distributions representing proceeds of a sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership in an amount per unit equal to the amount of any such
distributions payable on the Class A Units, whether made prior to, on or after
the Distribution Participation Date, provided that the amount of such
distributions shall not exceed the positive balances of the Capital Accounts
of the holders of such LTIP Units to the extent attributable to the ownership
of such LTIP Units. Distributions on the LTIP Units, if authorized, shall be
payable on such dates and in such manner as may be authorized by the General
Partner (any such date, a " _Distribution Payment Date_ "); provided that the
Distribution Payment Date and the record date for determining which holders
of LTIP Units are entitled to receive a distribution shall be the same as the
corresponding dates relating to the corresponding distribution on the Class A
Units.

 

F. _Special LTIP Unit Distribution_. As of the Distribution Participation Date
for an LTIP Unit that is not forfeited on or prior to such Distribution
Participation Date, the holder of such LTIP Unit will be entitled to receive a
special distribution (the " _Special LTIP Unit Distribution_ ") with respect
to such unit, equal to the Aggregate Special LTIP Unit Distribution Amount
with respect to such LTIP Unit, divided by the total number of such holders
LTIP Units that (A) have the same Distribution Participation Date, (B) were
issued as part of the same award or program for purposes of _Section 4.6_ as
specified in the Vesting Agreement or other documentation pursuant to which
such LTIP Units are issued (the " _Same Award_ " with respect to such LTIP
Unit), and (C) are not forfeited on or prior to such
Distribution Participation Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such amount
shall not exceed either (x) the amount of non-liquidating cash distributions
per unit that were paid on the Class A Units on or after the date of the
issuance of such LTIP Unit (or such other date as is specified as the
Distribution Measurement Date in the Vesting Agreement or other documentation
pursuant to which such LTIP Unit is issued) (such date being referred to as
the " _Distribution Measurement Date_ " with respect to such LTIP Unit) and
prior to such Distribution Participation Date or (y) an amount that, together
with all other Special LTIP Unit Distributions made to such holder on the same
date with respect to such holders other LTIP Units issued as

 



22 ##### Table of Contents

  

 part of the Same Award as such LTIP Unit, exceeds the positive balance of
the Capital Account of such holder to the extent attributable to such LTIP
Units. The " _Aggregate Special LTIP Unit Distribution Amount_ " with respect
to a holders LTIP Unit equals the aggregate amount determined by totaling,
for each of such holders LTIP Units that were issued as part of the Same
Award, (x) the amount of non-liquidating cash distributions per unit that
were paid on the Class A Units on or after the Distribution Measurement Date
with respect to such LTIP Unit and prior to the earlier of the Distribution
Participation Date for such LTIP Unit or the Distribution Participation Date
for the LTIP Unit with respect to which the Aggregate Special LTIP Unit
Distribution Amount is being calculated, multiplied by (y) the LTIP Unit
Sharing Percentage for such LTIP Unit, and subtracting from such
total aggregate amount all Special LTIP Unit Distributions previously made
with respect to LTIP Units that were issued as part of the Same Award. The
Special LTIP Unit Distribution for an LTIP Unit will be payable on the first
Distribution Payment Date on or after the Distribution Participation Date for
such LTIP Unit if and when authorized by the General Partner out of funds
legally available for the payment of distributions; _provided_ that, to the
extent not otherwise prohibited by the terms of any class of Partnership
Interests entitled to any preference in distribution and authorized by the
General Partner out of funds legally available for the payment of
distributions, such Special LTIP Unit Distribution may be paid prior to
such Distribution Payment Date. On or after the Distribution Participation
Date with respect to an LTIP Unit, if such LTIP Unit is outstanding, no
distributions (other than in Class A Units, Class B Units, LTIP Units or other
Partnership Interests ranking on par with or junior to such units as to
distributions and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of the Partnership) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment upon
the Class A Units, the Class B Units, the LTIP Units or any other Partnership
Interests ranking junior to or on a parity with the LTIP Unit as to
distributions for any period (other than Special LTIP Unit Distributions with
respect to LTIP Units that had an earlier Distribution Participation Date)
unless the full amount of any Special LTIP Unit Distributions due with respect
to such LTIP Unit have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid.

 

G. _LTIP Units Intended to Qualify as Profits Interests_.

 

(i) Distributions made pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ shall be adjusted as
necessary to ensure that the amount apportioned to each LTIP Unit does not
exceed the amount attributable to items of Partnership income or gain realized
after the date such LTIP Unit was issued by the Partnership. The intent of
this _Section 5.1.G_ is to ensure that any LTIP Units issued after the date
of this Agreement qualify as "profits interests" under Revenue Procedure
93-27, 1993-2 C.B. 343 (June 9, 1993) and Revenue Procedure 2001-43, 2001-2
C.B. 191 (August 3, 2001), and this _Section 5.1_ and Article VI shall
be interpreted and applied consistently therewith. The General Partner at its
discretion may amend this _Section 5.1.G_ to ensure that any LTIP Units
granted after the date of this Agreement will qualify as "profits interests"
under Revenue Procedure 93-27, 1993-2 C.B. 343 (June 9, 1993) and Revenue
Procedure 2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191 (August 3, 2001) (and any other similar
rulings or regulations that may be in effect at such time).

 

(ii) The Partners agree that the General Partner may make a Safe Harbor
Election (as defined below), on behalf of itself and of all Partners, to have
the LTIP Safe Harbor apply irrevocably with respect to LTIP Units transferred
in connection with the performance of services by a Partner in a partner
capacity. The Safe Harbor Election shall be effective as of the date of
issuance of such LTIP Units. If such election is made, (A) the Partnership
and each Partner agree to comply with all requirements of the LTIP Safe Harbor
with respect to all interests in the Partnership transferred in connection
with the performance of services by a Partner in a partner capacity, whether
such Partner was admitted as a Partner or as the transferee of a previous
Partner, and (B) the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to comply
with all record keeping requirements and other administrative requirements
with respect to the LTIP Safe Harbor as shall be required by proposed or final
regulations relating thereto.

(iii) The Partners agree that if a Safe Harbor Election is made by the
General Partner, (A) each LTIP Unit issued hereunder is a Safe Harbor
Interest, (B) each LTIP Unit represents a profits interest received for
services rendered or to be rendered to or for the benefit of the Partnership
by the LTIP Unitholder in his or her capacity as a Partner or in anticipation
of becoming a Partner, and (C) the fair market value of each LTIP Unit

 



23 ##### Table of Contents

  

 issued by the Partnership upon receipt by the LTIP Unitholder as of the date
of issuance is zero (plus the amount, if any, of any Capital Contributions
made to the Partnership by such LTIP Unitholder in connection with the
issuance of such LTIP Unit), representing the liquidation value of such
interest upon receipt (with such valuation being consented to and hereby
approved by all Partners).

 

(iv) Each Partner, by signing this Agreement or by accepting such transfer,
hereby agrees to comply with all requirements of any Safe Harbor Election
made by the General Partner with respect to each LTIP Unitholders Safe Harbor
Interest.

(v) The General Partner shall file or cause the Partnership to file all
returns, reports and other documentation as may be required, as reasonably
determined by the General Partner, to perfect and maintain any Safe Harbor
Election made by the General Partner with respect to granting of each LTIP
Unitholders Safe Harbor Interest.

(vi) The General Partner is hereby authorized and empowered, without further
vote or action of the Partners, to amend this Agreement to the extent
necessary or helpful in accordance with the advice of Partnership tax counsel
or accountants to sustain the Partnerships position that (A) it has complied
with the LTIP Safe Harbor requirements in order to provide for a Safe Harbor
Election and it has ability to maintain the same, or (B) the issuance of the
LTIP Units is not a taxable event with respect to the LTIP Unitholders, and
the General Partner shall have the authority to execute any such amendment by
and on behalf of each Partner pursuant to the power of attorney granted by
this Agreement. Any undertaking by any Partner necessary or desirable to (A)
enable or preserve a Safe Harbor Election or (B) otherwise to prevent to the
issuance of LTIP Units to LTIP Unitholders from being a taxable event may be
reflected in such amendments and, to the extent so reflected, shall be binding
on each Partner.

 

(vii) Each Partner agrees to cooperate with the General Partner to perfect and
maintain any Safe Harbor Election, and to timely execute and deliver any
documentation with respect thereto reasonably requested by the General
Partner, at the expense of the Partnership.

(viii) No Transfer of any interest in the Partnership by a Partner shall be
effective unless prior to such Transfer, the assignee or intended recipient of
such interest shall have agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of
this Section 5.1.G, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the General Partner.

(ix) The provisions of this Section 5.1.G shall apply regardless of whether or
not an LTIP Unitholder files an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the
Code.

(x) The General Partner may amend this Section 5.1.G as it deems necessary or
appropriate to maximize the tax benefit of the issuance of LTIP Units to any
LTIP Unitholder if there are changes in the law or Regulations concerning the
issuance of partnership interests for services.

 



   Section 5.2 | Distributions in Kind 
---|--- 

The General Partner may determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, to
make a distribution in kind of Partnership assets to the holders of
Partnership Interests, and such assets shall be distributed in such a fashion
as to ensure that the fair market value is distributed and allocated in the
same manner as a cash distribution in accordance with Articles V, VI and XIII
hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Partner shall be
entitled to demand property other than cash in connection with any
distributions by the Partnership.

 



   Section 5.3 | Amounts Withheld 
---|--- 

All amounts withheld pursuant to the Code or any provisions of any state or
local tax law and _Section 10.5_ with respect to any allocation, payment or
distribution to the General Partner, the Limited Partners or Assignees shall

 



24 ##### Table of Contents

  

 be treated as amounts distributed to the General Partner, Limited Partners
or Assignees, as the case may be, pursuant to _Section 5.1_ for all purposes
under this Agreement.

 



   Section 5.4 | Distributions upon Liquidation 
---|--- 

Proceeds from a Liquidating Event shall be distributed to the Partners in
accordance with _Section 13.2_.



   Section 5.5 | Revisions to Reflect Issuance of Partnership Interests 
---|--- 

If the Partnership issues Partnership Interests to the General Partner or any
Additional Limited Partner pursuant to _Article IV_ hereof, the General
Partner shall make such revisions to this _Article V_ and the Partner Registry
in the books and records of the Partnership as it deems necessary to reflect
the terms of the issuance of such Partnership Interests. Such revisions shall
not require the consent or approval of any other Partner.

ALLOCATIONS 



   Section 6.1 | Allocations for Capital Account Purposes 
---|--- 

For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the
rights of the Partners among themselves, the Partnerships items of income,
gain, loss and deduction (computed in accordance with _Exhibit B_ ) shall be
allocated among the Partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as
provided herein below.

A. _Net Income_. Subject to Section 4.6.C(iii), after giving effect to the
special allocations set forth in _Section 1_ of _Exhibit C_ of the
Partnership Agreement and any special allocations required to be made pursuant
to _Section 6.1.E_ , Net Income shall be allocated:

 



     | (1) | first, to the General Partner to the extent that Net Loss
previously allocated to the General Partner pursuant to _Section 6.1.B(5)_
exceeds Net Income previously allocated to the General Partner pursuant to
this clause (1); 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | second, to the General Partner until the cumulative Net
Income allocated under this clause (2) equals the cumulative Net Loss
allocated the General Partner under _Section 6.1.B(4)_ ; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (3) | third, to the holders of any Partnership Interests that are
entitled to any preference upon liquidation until the cumulative Net Income
allocated under this clause (3) equals the cumulative Net Loss allocated to
such Partners under _Section 6.1.B(3)_ ; 
---|---|--- 



     | (4) | fourth, to the holders of any Partnership Interests that are
entitled to any preference in distribution in accordance with the rights of
any other class of Partnership Interests until each such Partnership Interest
has been allocated, on a cumulative basis pursuant to this clause (4), Net
Income equal to the amount of distributions payable that are attributable to
the preference of such class of Partnership Interests, whether or not paid
(and, within such class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage
Interests as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is being
made); 
---|---|--- 



     | (5) | fifth, to the holders of any Partnership Interests that are
not entitled to any preference upon liquidation until the cumulative Net
Income allocated under this clause (5) equals the cumulative Net Loss
allocated to such Partners under _Section 6.1.B(2)_ ; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (6) | finally, with respect to Partnership Interests that are not
entitled to any preference in distribution or with respect to which
distributions are not limited to any preference in distribution, pro rata to
each such class in accordance with the terms of such class (and, within such
class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage Interests as of the
last day of the period for which such allocation is being made). 
---|---|--- 
 



25 ##### Table of Contents

  

B. _Net Loss_. Subject to Section 4.6.C(iii), after giving effect to the
special allocations set forth in _Section 1_ of _Exhibit C_ of the
Partnership Agreement and any special allocations required to be made pursuant
to _Sections 6.1.E_, Net Loss shall be allocated:

 



     | (1) | first, to the holders of Partnership Interests that are not
entitled to any preference in distribution or with respect to which
distributions are not limited to any preference in distribution, in proportion
to, and to the extent that, their share of the Net Income previously
allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1.A(6)_ exceeds, on a cumulative basis, the
sum of (a) distributions with respect to such Partnership Interests pursuant
to clause (ii) of _Section 5.1.B_ and (b) Net Loss allocated under this
clause (1); 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | second, with respect to classes of Partnership Interests
that are not entitled to any preference in distribution upon liquidation, pro
rata to each such class in accordance with the terms of such class (and,
within such class, pro rata in proportion to the respective Percentage
Interests as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is being
made); _provided_ , _however_ , that Net Loss shall not be allocated to any
Partner pursuant to this  _Section 6.1.B(2)_ to the extent that such
allocation would cause such Partner to have an Adjusted Capital Account
Deficit (or increase any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit)
(determined in the case of a Partner who also holds classes of Partnership
Interests that are entitled to any preferences in distribution upon
liquidation, by subtracting from such Partners Adjusted Capital Account the
amount of such preferred distribution to be made upon liquidation) at the end
of such taxable year (or portion thereof); 
---|---|--- 



     | (3) | third, with respect to classes of Partnership Interests that
are entitled to any preference in distribution upon liquidation, in reverse
order of the priorities of each such class (and within each such class, pro
rata in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests as of the last
day of the period for which such allocation is being made); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Net Loss shall not be allocated to any Partner pursuant to
this _Section 6.1.B(3)_ to the extent that such allocation would cause such
Partner to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or increase any existing
Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) at the end of such taxable year (or portion
thereof); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (4) | fourth, to the General Partner in an amount equal to the
amount of the Partnerships Recourse Liabilities; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (5) | thereafter, to the General Partner. 
---|---|--- 

C. _Allocation of Nonrecourse Debt_. For purposes of Regulation Section
1.752-3(a), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the Partnership
in excess of the sum of (i) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain and (ii)
the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated by
the General Partner by taking into account facts and circumstances relating
to each Partners respective interest in the profits of the Partnership unless
and to the extent provided otherwise in an agreement between any Partner and
the Partnership. For this purpose, the General Partner shall have the sole
and absolute discretion in any Fiscal Year to allocate such excess Nonrecourse
Liabilities among the Partners in any manner permitted under Code Section 752
and the Regulations thereunder. 

D. _Recapture Income_. Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or
other taxable disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent
possible after taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant
to _Exhibit C_ , be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions
and to the same extent as such Partners have been allocated any deductions
directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as Recapture
Income.

E. _Special Allocations Regarding LTIP Units_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of _Section 6.1.A_ , Liquidating Gains shall first be allocated to the LTIP
Unitholders until their Economic Capital Account Balances, to the extent
attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units, are equal to (i) the Class A
Unit Economic Balance, multiplied by (ii) the number of their LTIP Units, plus
the aggregate net amount of Net Income and Net Loss allocated to such LTIP
Units prior to the Distribution Participation Date with respect to such LTIP
Units less the amount of any Special LTIP Unit Distributions with respect to
such LTIP Units; provided, however, that no such

 



26 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Liquidating Gains will be allocated with respect to any particular LTIP Unit
unless and to the extent that such Liquidating Gains, when aggregated with
other Liquidating Gains realized since the issuance of such LTIP Unit, exceed
Liquidating Losses realized since the issuance of such LTIP Unit. After giving
effect to the special allocations set forth in _Section 1_ of _Exhibit C_
hereto, and notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 6.1.A_ and _6.1.B_
above, in the event that, due to distributions with respect to Class A Units
in which the LTIP Units do not participate or otherwise, the Economic Capital
Account Balances of any present or former holder of LTIP Units, to the extent
attributable to the holders ownership of LTIP Units, exceed the target
balance specified above, then Liquidating Losses shall be allocated to such
holder to the extent necessary to reduce or eliminate the disparity. In the
event that Liquidating Gains or Liquidating Losses are allocated under this
_Section 6.1.E_ , Net Income allocable under _Section 6.1.A(6)_ and any Net
Loss shall be recomputed without regard to the Liquidating Gains
or Liquidating Losses so allocated. For this purpose, " _Liquidating Gains_ "
means net gains that are or would be realized in connection with the actual or
hypothetical sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Partnership, including but not limited to net capital gain realized in
connection with an adjustment to the value of Partnership assets under Section
704(b) of the Code made pursuant to _Section 1.D_ of _Exhibit B_ of
the Partnership Agreement. " _Liquidating Losses_ " means any net capital
loss realized in connection with any such event. The " _Economic Capital
Account Balances_ " of the LTIP Unitholders will be equal to their Capital
Account balances to the extent attributable to their ownership of LTIP Units,
plus the amount of their share of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership
Minimum Gain, in either case to the extent attributable to their ownership of
LTIP Units and computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into account all
allocations through the date on which any allocation is made under this
_Section 6.1.E_ , but prior to the realization of any Liquidating Gains.
Similarly, the " _Class A Unit Economic Balance_ " shall mean (i) the Capital
Account balance of the General Partner, plus the amount of the General
Partners share of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership Minimum Gain, in
either case to the extent attributable to the General Partners ownership of
Class A Units and computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into account
all allocations through the date on which any allocation is made under this
_Section 6.1.E_ , but prior to the realization of any Liquidating Gains,
divided by (ii) the number of the General Partners Class A Units. Any such
allocations shall be made among the LTIP Unitholders in proportion to the
amounts required to be allocated to each under this  _Section 6.1.E_. The
parties agree that the intent of this _Section 6.1.E_ is to make the Capital
Account balance associated with each LTIP Unit to be economically equivalent
to the Capital Account balance associated with the General Partners Class A
Units (on a per-Unit basis, other than differences resulting from the
allocation of Net Income and Net Loss allocated to such LTIP Units prior to
the Distribution Participation Date with respect to such LTIP Units in excess
of the amount of Special LTIP Unit Distributions paid with respect to such
LTIP Units), provided that Liquidating Gains are of a sufficient magnitude to
do so upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership, or upon an adjustment to the Partners Capital Accounts pursuant
to _Section 1.D_ of _Exhibit B_. To the extent the LTIP Unitholders receive a
distribution in excess of their Capital Accounts, such distribution will be a
guaranteed payment under Section 707(c) of the Code.



   Section 6.2 | Revisions to Allocations to Reflect Issuance of
Partnership Interests 
---|--- 

If the Partnership issues Partnership Interests to the General Partner or any
Additional Limited Partner pursuant to _Article IV_ hereof, the General
Partner shall make such revisions to this _Article VI_ and the Partner
Registry in the books and records of the Partnership as it deems necessary to
reflect the terms of the issuance of such Partnership Interests, including
making preferential allocations to classes of Partnership Interests that are
entitled thereto. Such revisions shall not require the consent or approval of
any other Partner.

   Section 7.2 | Certificate of Limited Partnership

The General Partner has previously filed the Certificate of
Limited Partnership with the Secretary of State of Delaware. To the extent
that such action is determined by the General Partner to be reasonable and
necessary or appropriate, the General Partner shall file amendments to and
restatements of the Certificate of Limited Partnership and do all the things
to maintain the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership in
which the limited partners have limited liability) under the laws of the State
of Delaware and each other state, the District of Columbia or other
jurisdiction in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own
property. Subject to the terms of _Section 8.5.A(4)_ , the General Partner
shall not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of
the Certificate of Limited Partnership or any amendment thereto to any
Limited Partner. The General Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to cause
to be filed such other certificates or documents as may be reasonable and
necessary or appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and
operation of a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited
partners have limited liability) in the State of Delaware and any other state,
the District of Columbia or other jurisdiction in which the Partnership may
elect to do business or own property.



   Section 7.3 | Title to Partnership Assets 
---|--- 

Title to Partnership assets, whether real, personal or mixed and
whether tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be owned by the
Partnership as an entity, and no Partners, individually or collectively, shall
have any ownership interest in such Partnership assets or any portion thereof.
Title to any or all of the Partnership assets may be held in the name of the
Partnership, the General Partner or one or more nominees, as the General
Partner may determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, including
Affiliates of the General Partner. The General Partner hereby declares and
warrants that any Partnership assets for which legal title is held in the name
of the General Partner or any nominee or Affiliate of the General Partner
shall be held by the General Partner for the use and benefit of
the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. All
Partnership assets shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its
books and records, irrespective of the name in which legal title to such
Partnership assets is held. 



   Section 7.4 | Reimbursement of the General Partner 
---|--- 

A. _No Compensation_. Except as provided in this _Section 7.4_ and elsewhere
in this Agreement (including _Section 10.3.C_ and the provisions of _Articles
V_ and _VI_ regarding distributions, payments and allocations to which it may
be entitled), the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services
as the general partner of the Partnership.

B. _Responsibility for Partnership, General Partner and General Partner
Entity Expenses_. The Partnership shall be responsible for and shall pay all
expenses relating to the Partnerships organization, the ownership of its

 



31 ##### Table of Contents

  

 assets and its operations. The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a
monthly basis, or such other basis as the General Partner may determine in its
sole and absolute discretion, for all expenses it incurs relating to or
resulting from the ownership and operation of, or for the benefit of, the
Partnership (including, without limitation, (i) expenses relating to the
ownership of interests in and operation of the Partnership, (ii) compensation
of the officers and employees including, without limitation, payments under
any stock option or incentive plan that provides for stock units, or other
phantom stock, pursuant to which employees will receive payments based upon
dividends on or the value of Shares, (iii) auditing expenses, (iv) director
fees and expenses of the General Partner Entity, (v) all costs and expenses of
being a public company, including costs of filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, reports and other distributions to its shareholders, and
(vi) all costs and expenses associated with litigation involving the General
Partner and the General Partner Entity, the Partnership or any Subsidiary);
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the amount of any such reimbursement shall
be reduced by (x) any interest earned by the General Partner with respect to
bank accounts or other instruments or accounts held by it on behalf of the
Partnership as permitted in _Section 7.5.A_ (which interest is considered to
belong to the Partnership and shall be paid over to the Partnership to the
extent not applied to reimburse the General Partner for expenses hereunder);
and (y) any amount derived by the General Partner from any
investments permitted in _Section 7.5.A_ ; (ii) if the General Partner or
General Partner Entity qualifies as a REIT, the Partnership shall not be
responsible for any taxes that the General Partner Entity would not have been
required to pay if that entity qualified as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes or any taxes imposed on the General Partner or General Partner Entity
by reason of that entitys failure to distribute to its shareholders an amount
equal to its taxable income; (iii) the Partnership shall not be responsible
for expenses or liabilities incurred by the General Partner in connection with
any business or assets of the General Partner other than its ownership of
Partnership Interests or operation of the business of the Partnership or
ownership of interests in Qualified Assets to the extent permitted in _Section
7.5.A_ ; and (iv) the Partnership shall not be responsible for any expenses or
liabilities of the General Partner that are excluded from the scope of the
indemnification provisions of _Section 7.7.A_ by reason of the provisions of
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) thereof. The General Partner shall determine in good
faith the amount of expenses incurred by it or the General Partner Entity
related to the ownership of Partnership Interests or operation of, or for the
benefit of, the Partnership. If certain expenses are incurred that are related
both to the ownership of Partnership Interests or operation of, or for the
benefit of, the Partnership and to the ownership of other assets (other than
Qualified Assets as permitted under _Section 7.5.A_ ) or the operation of
other businesses, such expenses will be allocated to the Partnership and such
other entities (including the General Partner and General Partner Entity)
owning such other assets or businesses in such a manner as the General Partner
in its sole and absolute discretion deems fair and reasonable. Such
reimbursements shall be in addition to any reimbursement to the General
Partner and the General Partner Entity pursuant to _Section 10.3.C_ and as a
result of indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.7_. All payments and
reimbursements hereunder shall be characterized for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as expenses of the Partnership incurred on its behalf, and not as
expenses of the General Partner or General Partner Entity.

 

C. _Partnership Interest Issuance Expenses_. The General Partner shall also be
reimbursed for all expenses it incurs relating to any issuance of Partnership
Interests, Shares, Debt of the Partnership, Funding Debt of the General
Partner or the General Partner Entity or rights, options, warrants or
convertible or exchangeable securities pursuant to _Article IV_
(including, without limitation, all costs, expenses, damages and other
payments resulting from or arising in connection with litigation related to
any of the foregoing), all of which expenses are considered by the Partners to
constitute expenses of, and for the benefit of, the Partnership.

D. _Repurchases of Shares_. If the General Partner Entity exercises its rights
under its organizational documents to purchase Shares or otherwise elects or
is required to purchase from its shareholders Shares in connection with a
share repurchase or similar program or otherwise, or for the purpose of
delivering such Shares to satisfy an obligation under any dividend
reinvestment or equity purchase program adopted by the General Partner Entity,
any employee equity purchase plan adopted by the General Partner Entity or any
similar obligation or arrangement undertaken by the General Partner Entity in
the future, the purchase price paid by the General Partner Entity for those
Shares and any other expenses incurred by the General Partner Entity in
connection with such purchase shall be considered expenses of the Partnership
and shall be reimbursable to the

 



32 ##### Table of Contents

  

 General Partner Entity, subject to the conditions that: (i) if those Shares
subsequently are to be sold by the General Partner Entity, the General Partner
Entity shall pay to the Partnership any proceeds received by the General
Partner Entity for those Shares ( _provided_ , _however_ , that a transfer of
Shares for Partnership Units pursuant to Section 8.6 would not be considered a
sale for such purposes); and (ii) if such Shares are required to be cancelled
pursuant to applicable law or are not retransferred by the General Partner
Entity within thirty (30) days after the purchase thereof, the General Partner
shall cause the Partnership to cancel a number of Partnership Units (rounded
to the nearest whole Partnership Unit) held by the General Partner equal to
the product attained by multiplying the number of those Shares by a fraction,
the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the Conversion
Factor. 

E. _Reimbursement not a Distribution_. Except as set forth in the succeeding
sentence, if and to the extent any reimbursement made pursuant to this
_Section 7.4_ is determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes not to
constitute a payment of expenses of the Partnership, the amount so determined
shall constitute a guaranteed payment with respect to capital within
the meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be treated consistently
therewith by the Partnership and all Partners and shall not be treated as a
distribution for purposes of computing the Partners Capital Accounts. Amounts
deemed paid by the Partnership to the General Partner in connection with
redemption of Partnership Units pursuant to _Section 7.5.B_ shall be treated
as a distribution for purposes of computing the Partners Capital Accounts.

 

F. _Funding for Certain Capital Transactions_. In the event that the General
Partner Entity shall undertake to acquire (whether by merger, consolidation,
purchase, or otherwise) the assets or equity interests of another Person and
such acquisition shall require the payment of cash by the General Partner
Entity (whether to such Person or to any other selling party or parties
in such transaction or to one or more creditors, if any, of such Person or
such selling party or parties), (a) the Partnership shall advance to the
General Partner Entity the cash required to consummate such acquisition if,
and to the extent that, such cash is not to be obtained by the General
Partner Entity through an issuance of Shares described in _Section 4.2_ or
pursuant to a transaction described in _Section 7.5.B_ , (b) the General
Partner Entity shall, upon consummation of such acquisition, transfer to the
Partnership (or cause to be transferred to the Partnership), in full and
complete satisfaction of such advance and as required by _Section 7.5_ , the
assets or equity interests of such Person acquired by the General Partner
Entity in such acquisition (or equity interests in Persons owning all of such
assets or equity interests), and (c) pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 4.2_ and _Section 7.5.B_ , the Partnership shall issue to the
General Partner, Partnership Interests and/or rights, options, warrants or
convertible or exchangeable securities of the Partnership having designations,
preferences and other rights that are substantially the same as those of any
additional Shares, other equity securities, New Securities and/or Convertible
Funding Debt, as the case may be, issued by the General Partner Entity in
connection with such acquisition (whether issued directly to participants in
the acquisition transaction or to third parties in order to obtain cash to
complete the acquisition). In addition to, and without limiting, the
foregoing, in the event that the General Partner Entity engages in a
transaction in which (x) the General Partner Entity (or a wholly owned direct
or indirect Subsidiary of the General Partner Entity) merges with another
entity (referred to as the " _Parent Entity_ ") that is organized in the
UPREIT form (i.e., where the Parent Entity holds substantially all of
its assets and conducts substantially all of its operations through a
partnership, limited liability company or other entity (referred to as an "
_Operating Entity_ ")) (" _UPREIT_ ") and the General Partner Entity survives
such merger, (y) such Operating Entity merges with or is otherwise acquired by
the Partnership in exchange in whole or in part for Partnership Interests, and
(z) the General Partner Entity is required or elects to pay part of
the consideration in connection with such merger involving the Parent Entity
in the form of cash and part of the consideration in the form of Shares, the
Partnership shall distribute to the General Partner with respect to its
existing Partnership Interest an amount of cash sufficient to complete such
transaction and the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to cancel a
number of Partnership Units (rounded to the nearest whole number) held by the
General Partner equal to the product attained by multiplying the number of
additional Shares of the General Partner Entity that the General Partner
Entity would have issued to the Parent Entity or the owners of the Parent
Entity in such transaction if the entire consideration therefor were to have
been paid in Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the
denominator of which is the Conversion Factor.

     Section 7.5 | Outside Activities of the General Partner;
Relationship of Shares to Partnership Units; Funding Debt 
---|--- 
 

A. _General_. The General Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
from time to time hold or acquire assets in its own name or otherwise other
than through the Partnership so long as the General Partner takes commercially
reasonable measures to ensure that the economic benefits and burdens of such
assets are otherwise vested in the Partnership, through assignment, mortgage
loan or otherwise or, if it is not commercially reasonable to vest such
economic interests in the Partnership, the General Partner shall make such
amendments to this Agreement as the General Partner determines are necessary
or desirable, including, without limitation, adjusting the Conversion Factor
to reflect such activities and the direct ownership of assets by the General
Partner. Nothing contained in this Agreement (including this Section 7.5)
shall be deemed to prohibit the General Partner from guaranteeing or being a
co-obligor, co-borrower, guarantor or surety of, or otherwise providing credit
support of any kind in respect of, any Debt or other indebtedness or
obligations of the Partnership.

 

B. _Repurchase of Shares and Other Securities_. If the General Partner Entity
exercises its rights under its organizational documents to purchase Shares or
otherwise elects to purchase from the holders thereof Shares, other equity
securities of the General Partner Entity, New Securities or Convertible
Funding Debt, then the General Partner Entity shall cause the Partnership to
purchase from the General Partner Entity (a) in the case of a purchase of
Shares, that number of Partnership Units of the appropriate class equal to the
product obtained by multiplying the number of Shares purchased by the
General Partner Entity times a fraction, the numerator of which is one and
the denominator of which is the Conversion Factor, or (b) in the case of the
purchase of any other securities on the same terms and for the same aggregate
price that the General Partner Entity purchased such securities.

C. _Equity Incentive Plan_. If, at any time or from time to time, the General
Partner Entity sells or otherwise issues Shares pursuant to any Equity
Incentive Plan, the General Partner Entity shall transfer or cause to be
transferred the proceeds of the sale of such Shares, if any, to the
Partnership as an additional Capital Contribution and the Partnership shall
issue to the General Partner Entity an amount of additional Partnership Units
equal to the number of Shares so sold or issued divided by the Conversion
Factor. If the Partnership or the General Partner Entity acquires Shares as a
result of the forfeiture of such Shares under any Equity Incentive Plan, then
the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to cancel, without payment of
any consideration to the General Partner, that number of Partnership Units of
the appropriate class equal to the number of Shares so acquired, and, if the
Partnership acquired such Shares, it shall transfer such Shares to the General
Partner for cancellation.

 

D. _Issuances of Shares and Other Securities_. So long as the common shares of
the General Partner Entity are Publicly Traded, the General Partner Entity
shall not grant, award or issue any additional Shares (other than Shares
issued pursuant to _Section 8.6_ hereof or pursuant to a dividend or
distribution (including any share split) of Shares to all of its
shareholders that results in an adjustment to the Conversion Factor pursuant
to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition thereof), other equity
securities of the General Partner Entity, New Securities or Convertible
Funding Debt unless (i) the General Partner shall cause, pursuant to _Section
4.2.A_ hereof, the Partnership to issue to the General Partner, Partnership
Interests or rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable
securities of the Partnership having designations, preferences and other
rights, all such that the economic interests are substantially the same as
those of such additional Shares, other equity securities, New Securities or
Convertible Funding Debt, as the case may be, and (ii) in exchange therefor,
the General Partner Entity transfers or otherwise causes to be transferred to
the Partnership, as an additional Capital Contribution, the proceeds from the
grant, award, or issuance of such additional Shares, other equity securities,
New Securities or Convertible Funding Debt, as the case may be, or from the
exercise of rights contained in such additional Shares, other equity
securities, New Securities or Convertible Funding Debt, as the case may be
(or, in the case of an acquisition described in  _Section 7.4.F_ in which all
or a portion of the cash required to consummate such acquisition is to be
obtained by the General Partner Entity through an issuance of Shares described
in _Section 4.2_ , the General Partner Entity complies with such _Section
7.4.F_ ). Without limiting the foregoing, the General Partner Entity is
expressly authorized to issue additional Shares, other equity securities, New
Securities or Convertible

 Funding Debt, as the case may be, for less than fair market value, and the
General Partner is expressly authorized, pursuant to _Section 4.2.A_ hereof,
to cause the Partnership to issue to the General Partner corresponding
Partnership Interests (for example, and not by way of limitation, the issuance
of Shares and corresponding Partnership Units pursuant to a share purchase
plan providing for purchases of Shares, either by employees or shareholders,
at a discount from fair market value or pursuant to employee share options
that have an exercise price that is less than the fair market value of the
Shares, either at the time of issuance or at the time of exercise), as long as
(a) the General Partner concludes in good faith that such issuance is in the
interests of the General Partner and the Partnership and (b) the General
Partner Entity transfers all proceeds from any such issuance or exercise to
the Partnership as an additional Capital Contribution.

E. _Funding Debt_. The General Partner or the General Partner Entity or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of either of them may incur a Funding Debt,
including, without limitation, Funding Debt that is convertible into Shares or
otherwise constitutes a class of New Securities (" _Convertible Funding Debt_
"), subject to the condition that the General Partner, the General Partner
Entity or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, lend to the Partnership the net
proceeds of such Funding Debt; _provided_ , _however_ , that Convertible
Funding Debt shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of Section
7.5.D above; and, provided further that, if the General Partner Entity
attempts to qualify as a REIT, the General Partner, the General Partner Entity
or such Subsidiary shall not be obligated to lend the net proceeds of any
Funding Debt to the Partnership in a manner that would be inconsistent with
the General Partners or General Partner Entitys ability to remain qualified
as a REIT. If the General Partner, General Partner Entity or such
Subsidiary enters into any Funding Debt, the loan to the Partnership shall be
on comparable terms and conditions, including interest rate, repayment
schedule, costs and expenses and other financial terms, as are applicable with
respect to or incurred in connection with such Funding Debt.

F. _Capital Contributions of the General Partner_. The Capital Contributions
by the General Partner pursuant to _Sections 7.5.C_ and _7.5.D_ will be
deemed to equal the cash contributed by the General Partner plus, (i) in the
case of cash contributions funded by an offering of any equity interests in or
other securities of the General Partner Entity, the offering costs
attributable to the cash contributed to the Partnership to the extent not
reimbursed pursuant to _Section 7.4.C_ and (ii) in the case of Partnership
Units issued pursuant to _Section 7.5.C_ , an amount equal to the difference
between the Value of the Shares sold pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan and
the net proceeds of such sale.

 

G. _Tax Loans_. The General Partner or the General Partner Entity may in its
sole and absolute discretion, cause the Partnership to make an interest free
loan to the General Partner or the General Partner Entity, as applicable,
_provided_ that the proceeds of such loans are used to satisfy any tax
liabilities of the General Partner or the General Partner Entity,
as applicable.



   Section 7.6 | Transactions with Affiliates 
---|--- 

A. _Transactions with Certain Affiliates_. Except as expressly permitted by
this Agreement with respect to any non-arms length transaction with an
Affiliate, the Partnership shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer
or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, or borrow funds
from, or lend funds to, any Partner or any Affiliate of the Partnership that
is not also a Subsidiary of the Partnership, except (i) loans from the General
Partner, the General Partner Entity, or any wholly owned Subsidiary of either
of them to the extent required pursuant to Section 7.5E, and (ii) pursuant to
transactions that are determined in good faith by the General Partner to be on
terms that are fair and reasonable.

 

B. _Conflict Avoidance_. The General Partner is expressly authorized to enter
into, in the name and on behalf of the Partnership, a non-competition
arrangement and other conflict avoidance agreements with various Affiliates of
the Partnership and General Partner on such terms as the General Partner, in
its sole and absolute discretion, believes are advisable.

C. _Benefit Plans Sponsored by the Partnership_. The General Partner in its
sole and absolute discretion and without the approval of the Limited
Partners, may propose and adopt on behalf of the Partnership employee benefit
plans funded by the Partnership for the benefit of employees of the General
Partner, the Partnership, Subsidiaries of the Partnership or any Affiliate of
any of them.



   Section 7.7 | Indemnification 
---|--- 

A. _General_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall
indemnify each Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, settlements and other amounts, arising from or in connection with any
and all claims, demands, subpoenas, requests for information, formal or
informal investigations, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, incurred by the Indemnitee and
relating to the Partnership, the General Partner or the General Partner Entity
or the direct or indirect operation of, or the direct or indirect ownership of
property by, the Indemnitee, Partnership or the General Partner or the
General Partner Entity as set forth in this Agreement in which any such
Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or
otherwise, unless it is established by a final determination of a court
of competent jurisdiction that: (i) the act or omission of the Indemnitee was
material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and either was committed
in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (ii) the
Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property
or services or (iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the Indemnitee
had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. Without
limitation, the foregoing indemnity shall extend to any liability of any
Indemnitee, pursuant to a loan guarantee, contractual obligation for any
indebtedness or other obligation or otherwise, for any indebtedness of the
Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership (including, without
limitation, any indebtedness which the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the
Partnership has assumed or taken subject to), and the General Partner is
hereby authorized and empowered, on behalf of the Partnership, to enter into
one or more indemnity agreements consistent with the provisions of this
_Section 7.7_ in favor of any Indemnitee having or potentially having
liability for any such indebtedness. The termination of any proceeding by
judgment, order or settlement does not create a presumption that the
Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in this
_Section 7.7.A_. The termination of any proceeding by conviction or upon a
plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or an entry of an order of
probation prior to judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that the
Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this _Section
7.7.A_ with respect to the subject matter of such proceeding. Any
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ shall be made only out of the
assets of the Partnership, and any insurance proceeds from the liability
policy covering the General Partner and any Indemnitee, and neither the
General Partner nor any Limited Partner shall have any obligation to
contribute to the capital of the Partnership or otherwise provide funds to
enable the Partnership to fund its obligations under this _Section 7.7_.

 

B. _Reimbursement of Expenses_. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
reasonable expenses expected to be incurred by an Indemnitee shall be paid or
reimbursed by the Partnership in advance of the final disposition of any and
all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative made or threatened against an Indemnitee upon
receipt by the Partnership of (i) a written affirmation by the Indemnitee of
the Indemnitees good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for
indemnification by the Partnership as authorized in this _Section 7.7_ has
been met and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to
repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of
conduct has not been met.

 

C. _No Limitation of Rights_. The indemnification provided by this _Section
7.7_ shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any
other Person may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the
Partners, as a matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue as to an
Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity unless otherwise
provided in a written agreement pursuant to which such Indemnitee is
indemnified.

D. _Insurance_. The Partnership may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General Partner shall
determine against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses

 



36 ##### Table of Contents

  

 that may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnerships
activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to
indemnify such Indemnitee or Person against such liability under the
provisions of this Agreement.

E. _No Personal Liability for Partners_. In no event may an
Indemnitee subject any of the Partners to personal liability by reason of the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement.

F.  _Interested Transactions_. An Indemnitee shall not be denied
indemnification in whole or in part under this _Section 7.7_ because the
Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the
indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the
terms of this Agreement.

G. _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are also for the benefit
of the Indemnitees, their employees, officers, directors, trustees, heirs,
successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any
rights for the benefit of any other Persons. Any amendment, modification
or repeal of this _Section 7.7_ , or any provision hereof, shall be
prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitation on the
Partnerships liability to any Indemnitee under this _Section 7.7_ as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or related to matters occurring, in whole or in
part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such
claims may arise or be asserted.

 

H. _Indemnification Payments Not Distributions_. If and to the extent any
payments to the General Partner pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ constitute
gross income to the General Partner (as opposed to the repayment of advances
made on behalf of the Partnership), such amounts shall constitute guaranteed
payments within the meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be
treated consistently therewith by the Partnership and all Partners, and shall
not be treated as distributions for purposes of computing the Partners
Capital Accounts.

 

I. _Exception to Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the General Partner shall not be entitled to indemnification
hereunder for any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense for which the
General Partner is obligated to indemnify the Partnership under any other
agreement between the General Partner and the Partnership.

 



   Section 7.8 | Liability of the General Partner 
---|--- 

A. _General_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the General Partner (which
for the purposes of this _Section 7.8_ shall include the directors, trustees
and officers of the General Partner) shall not be liable or accountable for
monetary or other damages or otherwise to the Partnership, any Partners or any
Assignees for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived
as a result of errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or
omission unless the General Partner acted in bad faith and the act or omission
was material to the matter giving rise to the loss, liability or benefit not
derived.

 

B. _Tax Consequences of General Partner Entity and Limited Partners_. The
Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General Partner, in
considering whether to dispose of any of the Partnership assets, shall take
into account the tax consequences to the General Partner Entity of any such
disposition and shall have no liability whatsoever to the Partnership or any
Limited Partner for decisions that are based upon or influenced by such tax
consequences. In addition, in exercising its authority under this Agreement
with respect to other matters, the General Partner may, but shall be under no
obligation to, take into account the tax consequences to any Partner
(including the General Partner Entity) of any action taken (or not taken) by
the General Partner. No decision or action (or failure to act) contemplated by
the preceding sentence shall constitute a breach of any duty owed to the
Partnership or the Limited Partners by law or equity, fiduciary or otherwise.
The General Partner and the Partnership shall not have liability to any
Limited Partner for monetary or other damages or otherwise for losses
sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by such Limited
Partner in connection with any taking

 



37 ##### Table of Contents

  

 or omission to take any such actions by the General Partner unless the
General Partner acted in bad faith and the act or omission was material to the
matter giving rise to the loss, liability or benefit not derived.

C. _No Obligation to Consider Separate Interests of Limited Partners or
Shareholders_. The Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General
Partner is acting on behalf of the Partnership, its equityholders (and, to the
extent separate, the equityholders of the General Partner Entity), and the
equityholders of the Limited Partners, collectively, and that, except as
otherwise set forth herein, the General Partner is under no obligation to
consider or give priority to the separate interests of the Limited Partners
(including, without limitation, the tax consequences to Limited Partners or
Assignees) in deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or decline to
take) any actions. Any decisions or actions taken or not taken in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of any duty
owed to the Partnership or the Limited Partners by law or equity, fiduciary
or otherwise. The General Partner and the Partnership shall not have liability
to any Limited Partner for monetary or other damages or otherwise for losses
sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by such Limited
Partner in connection with any taking or omission to take any such actions by
the General Partner unless the General Partner acted in bad faith and the act
or omission was material to the matter giving rise to the loss, liability or
benefit not derived.

D. _Actions of Agents_. Subject to its obligations and duties as
General Partner set forth in _Section 7.1.A_ , the General Partner may
exercise any of the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of
the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its
agents. The General Partner shall not be liable to the Partnership or any
Partner for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent
appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

 

E. _Effect of Amendment_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained
herein, any amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section 7.9_ or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the General Partners liability to the Partnership and the
Limited Partners or any other Person bound by this Agreement under this 
_Section 7.8_ as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification
or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters
occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

F. _Limitations of Fiduciary Duty_. _Sections 7.1.B_ , _7.1.E_ and this 
_Section 7.8_ and any other Section of this Agreement limiting the liability
of the General Partner and/or its trustees, directors and officers shall
constitute an express limitation of any duties, fiduciary or otherwise, that
they would owe the Partnership or the Limited Partners if such duty would be
imposed by any law, in equity or otherwise.

G. _Reliance on this Agreement_. To the extent that, at law or in equity, the
General Partner in its capacity as a Limited Partner, has duties (including
fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or the
Limited Partners, the General Partner shall not be liable to the Partnership
or to any other Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this
Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict
or eliminate the duties and liabilities of the General Partner or any other
Person under the Act or otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by
the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of the General
Partner.

 



   Section 7.9 | Other Matters Concerning the General Partner 
---|--- 

A. _Reliance on Documents_. The General Partner may rely and shall be
protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it in good
faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party
or parties.

B. _Reliance on Advisors_. The General Partner may consult with legal
counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers

matters which the General Partner reasonably believes to be within such
Persons professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to
have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.

C. _Action Through Agents_. The General Partner shall have the right, in
respect of any of its powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of
its duly authorized officers and a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-
fact. Each such attorney shall, to the extent provided by the General Partner
in the power of attorney, have full power and authority to do and perform all
and every act and duty that is permitted or required to be done by the General
Partner hereunder.

 

D. _Actions to Maintain REIT Status or Avoid Taxation of the General Partner
Entity_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or the Act,
if the General Partner Entity attempts to qualify as a REIT, any action of the
General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or any decision of the General
Partner to refrain from acting on behalf of the Partnership undertaken in the
good faith belief that such action or omission is necessary or advisable in
order (i) to protect the ability of the General Partner Entity to qualify as a
REIT or (ii) to allow the General Partner Entity ~~~~ to avoid incurring any
liability for taxes under Section 857, 4981, or any other provision of the
Code, is expressly authorized under this Agreement and is deemed approved by
all of the Limited Partners.

 



   Section 7.10 | Reliance by Third Parties 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
Person dealing with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the
General Partner has full power and authority, without consent or approval of
any other Partner or Person, to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner
any and all assets of the Partnership, to enter into any contracts on behalf
of the Partnership and to take any and all actions on behalf of the
Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General
Partner as if the General Partner were the Partnerships sole party in
interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives
any and all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such
Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner in
connection with any such dealing, in each case except to the extent that such
action imposes, or purports to impose, liability on the Limited Partner. In no
event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or its representatives
be obligated to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement have been complied
with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any act or action of
the General Partner or its representatives. Each and every certificate,
document or other instrument executed on behalf of the Partnership by the
General Partner or its representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor
of any and every Person relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (i) at the
time of the execution and delivery of such certificate, document or
instrument, this Agreement was in full force and effect, (ii) the Person
executing and delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly
authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the Partnership, and
(iii) such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed and delivered
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and is binding
upon the Partnership.

 



   Section 7.11 | Indebtedness to Third Parties 
---|--- 

The Partnership may incur Debt and other indebtedness, or enter into similar
credit, guarantee, financing or refinancing arrangements for any purpose
(including, without limitation, in connection with any acquisition of property

of its Affiliates) with any Person upon such terms as the General Partner
determines appropriate.

least twenty (20) Business Days (or such shorter period determined by the

receipt of the notice pursuant hereto, to keep confidential the information
set forth therein until such time as the General Partner Entity has made
public disclosure thereof, to use such information during such period of
confidentiality solely for purposes of determining whether to exercise the
Redemption Right (if applicable) and to execute a confidentiality agreement
provided by the General Partner Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that a

_provided_ , _however_ , that a Limited Partner may not exercise the
Redemption Right for fewer than one thousand (1,000) Partnership Units of a
particular class unless such Redeeming Partner then holds fewer than one
thousand (1,000) Partnership Units in that class, in which event the Redeeming
Partner must exercise the Redemption Right for all of the Partnership Units
held by such Redeeming Partner in that class, and _provided_ _further_ that,
with respect to a Limited Partner which is an entity, such Limited Partner may
exercise the Redemption Right for fewer than one thousand (1,000) Partnership
Units without regard to whether or not such Limited Partner is exercising the
Redemption Right for all of the Partnership Units held by such Limited Partner
as long as such Limited Partner is exercising the Redemption Right on behalf
of one or more of its equity owners in respect of one hundred percent (100%)
of such equity owners interests in such Limited Partner. For purposes hereof,
a Class A Unit issued upon conversion of a Class B Unit shall be deemed to
have been issued when the Class B Unit was issued.

(ii) The Redeeming Partner shall have no right with respect to any
Partnership Units so redeemed to receive any distributions paid in respect of
a Partnership Record Date for distributions in respect of Partnership Units
after the Specified Redemption Date with respect to such Partnership Units.

(iii) The Assignee of any Limited Partner may exercise the rights of such
Limited Partner pursuant to this _Section 8.6_ , and such Limited Partner
shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to such Assignee and shall be
bound by the exercise of such rights by such Limited Partners Assignee. In
connection with any exercise of such rights by such Assignee on behalf of
such Limited Partner, the Cash Amount shall be paid by the Partnership
directly to such Assignee and not to such Limited Partner.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to _Section 8.6.B(iv)_ , if
the General Partner Entity provides notice to the Limited Partners pursuant
to _Section 8.5.C_ hereof, the Redemption Right shall be exercisable, without
regard to whether the Partnership Units have been outstanding for any
specified period, during the period commencing on the date on which
the General Partner Entity provides such notice and ending on the record date
to determine shareholders eligible to receive such distribution or participate
in such Termination Transaction (or if none, ending on the date of
consummation of such distribution or Termination Transaction). If this
subparagraph (iv) applies, the Specified Redemption Date is the date on which
the Partnership and the General Partner receive notice of exercise of the
Redemption Right, rather than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the
Notice of Redemption.

B. _General Partner Entity Assumption of Redemption Right_.

 

(i) If a Limited Partner has delivered a Notice of Redemption, the General
Partner Entity may, in its sole and absolute discretion (subject to the
limitations on ownership and transfer of Shares set forth in the
organizational documents of the General Partner Entity), elect to assume
directly and satisfy a Redemption Right. If such election is made by the
General Partner Entity, the Partnership shall determine whether the General
Partner Entity shall pay the Redemption Amount in the form of the Cash Amount
or the Shares Amount. The Partnerships decision regarding whether such
payment shall be made in the form of the Cash Amount or the Shares Amount
shall be made by the General Partner, in its capacity as the general partner
of the Partnership and in its sole and absolute discretion. Payment of the
Redemption Amount in the form of Shares shall be in Shares duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and if applicable, free and clear
of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or restriction, other than those provided in
the organizational documents of the General Partner Entity, the Securities
Act, relevant state securities or blue sky laws and any applicable
registration rights agreement with respect to such Shares entered into by the
Redeeming Partner, and shall bear a legend in form and substance determined by
the General Partner Entity. Upon such payment by the General Partner Entity,
the

 



42 ##### Table of Contents

  

 General Partner Entity shall acquire the Partnership Units offered for
redemption by the Redeeming Partner and shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as the owner of such Partnership Units. Unless the General
Partner Entity, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall exercise its right
to assume directly and satisfy the Redemption Right, the General Partner
Entity shall not have any obligation to the Redeeming Partner or to
the Partnership with respect to the Redeeming Partners exercise of the
Redemption Right. If the General Partner Entity shall exercise its right to
assume directly and satisfy the Redemption Right in the manner described in
the first sentence of this _Section 8.6B_ and shall fully perform its
obligations in connection therewith, the Partnership shall have no right or
obligation to pay any amount to the Redeeming Partner with respect to such
Redeeming Partners exercise of the Redemption Right, and each of the
Redeeming Partner, the Partnership and the General Partner Entity shall, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, treat the transaction between the General
Partner Entity and the Redeeming Partner as a sale of the Redeeming Partners
Partnership Units to the General Partner Entity.

(ii) If the General Partner determines that the General Partner Entity shall
pay the Redeeming Partner the Redemption Amount in the form of Shares, the
total number of Shares to be paid to the Redeeming Partner in exchange for the
Redeeming Partners Partnership Units shall be the applicable Shares
Amount. If this amount is not a whole number of Shares, the Redeeming Partner
shall be paid (i) that number of Shares which equals the nearest whole number
less than such amount plus (ii) an amount of cash which the General Partner
Entity determines, in its reasonable discretion, to represent the fair value
of the remaining fractional Share which would otherwise be payable to the
Redeeming Partner.

 

(iii) Each Redeeming Partner agrees to execute such documents or provide such
information or materials as the General Partner Entity may reasonably require
in connection with the issuance of Shares upon exercise of the Redemption
Right.

C. _Exceptions to Exercise of Redemption Right_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of _Sections 8.6.A_ and _8.6.B_ , a Partner shall not be entitled
to exercise the Redemption Right pursuant to _Section 8.6.A_ if (but only as
long as) the delivery of Shares to such Partner on the Specified Redemption
Date would (i) be prohibited under the restrictions on the ownership or
transfer of Shares in the organizational documents of the General Partner
Entity, (ii) be prohibited under applicable federal or state securities laws
or regulations (in each case regardless of whether the General Partner Entity
would in fact assume and satisfy the Redemption Right), (iii) without limiting
the foregoing, result in the General Partners Entitys Shares being owned by
fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to rules of attribution),
(iv) without limiting the foregoing, result in the General Partner Entity
being "closely held" within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code or
cause the General Partner to own, actually or constructively, ten percent
(10%) or more of the ownership interests in a tenant of the General Partner
Entity, the Partnership or a subsidiary of the Partnership within the meaning
of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code, (v) otherwise cause the General Partner
Entity to fail to qualify as a REIT, or (v) without limiting the foregoing,
cause the acquisition of the Shares by the Redeeming Partner to be
"integrated" with any other distribution of Shares for purposes of complying
with the registration provision of the Securities Act, as amended.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner may, in its sole and
absolute discretion, waive such prohibition set forth in this  _Section
8.6.C_.

D. _No Liens on Partnership Units Delivered for Redemption_. Each Limited
Partner covenants and agrees that all Partnership Units delivered for
redemption shall be delivered to the Partnership or the General Partner
Entity, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens; and, notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the General Partner Entity
nor the Partnership shall be under any obligation to acquire Partnership Units
which are or may be subject to any liens. Each Limited Partner further agrees
that, if any Federal, state or local tax is payable as a result of
the transfer of its Partnership Units to the Partnership or the General
Partner Entity, such Limited Partner shall assume and pay such transfer tax.

 

E. _Additional Partnership Interests; Modification of Holding Period_. If the
Partnership issues Partnership Interests to any Additional Limited Partner
pursuant to _Article IV_ , the General Partner may make such revisions

 



43 ##### Table of Contents

  

 to this _Section 8.6_ as it determines are necessary to reflect the issuance
of such Partnership Interests (including setting forth any restrictions on the
exercise of the Redemption Right with respect to such Partnership Interests
which differ from those set forth in this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such revisions shall materially adversely affect the rights of any
other Limited Partner to exercise its Redemption Right without that Limited
Partners prior written consent. In addition, the General Partner may, with
respect to any holder or holders of Partnership Units, at any time and from
time to time, as it shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion, (i)
reduce or waive the length of the period prior to which such holder or holders
may not exercise the Redemption Right or (ii) reduce or waive the length of
the period between the exercise of the Redemption Right and the Specified
Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the first sentence of _Section 8.6.A(i)_ ,
the Class A Units issued in connection with the consummation of the
Reorganization under the Merger Agreement shall be entitled to exercise the
Redemption Right with respect to such Class A Units at any time following the
issuance of such Class A Units.

F. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
is authorized to take any action that it determines to be necessary or
appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any withholding
requirements established under the Code or any other federal, state or local
law that apply upon a Redeeming Partners exercise of the Redemption Right. If
a Redeeming Limited Partner believes that it is exempt from such withholding
upon the exercise of the Redemption Right, such Partner must furnish the
General Partner with a FIRPTA Certificate in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit G-1 or Exhibit G-2 and any other documentation reasonably
requested by the General Partner.

 

G. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
shall place appropriate restrictions on the ability of the Partners to
exercise their Redemption Rights as and if deemed necessary to ensure that the
Partnership does not constitute a "publicly traded partnership" taxable as an
association under Section 7704 of the Code. If and when the General Partner
determines that imposing such restrictions is necessary, the General Partner
shall give prompt written notice thereof to each of the Partners.

maintained by or on behalf of the Partnership in the regular course of its
business may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic tape,
photographs, micrographics or any other information storage device,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the records so maintained are convertible into

Partnership, or of the General Partner Entity (and, if different, the General
Partner) if such statements are prepared on a consolidated basis with the
Partnership, for such Fiscal Year, presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, such statements to be audited by a nationally
recognized "Big Four" firm of independent public accountants selected by the
General Partner Entity.

B. _Quarterly Reports_. If and to the extent that the General Partner Entity
mails quarterly reports to its shareholders, as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than the date on such reports are mailed, the General Partner
Entity shall cause to be mailed to each Limited Partner a report containing
unaudited financial statements, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, of
the Partnership, or of the General Partner Entity (and, if different, the
General Partner) if such statements are prepared on a consolidated basis with
the Partnership, and such other information as may be required by applicable
law or regulation, or as the General Partner determines to be appropriate.

C. The General Partner shall have satisfied its obligations under _Sections
9.3.A_ and _9.3.B_ by (i) to the extent the General Partner Entity or the
Partnership is subject to periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange
Act, filing the quarterly and annual reports required thereunder within the

TAX MATTERS 



   Section 10.1 | Preparation of Tax Returns 
---|--- 

The General Partner shall arrange for the preparation and timely filing
of all returns of Partnership income, gains, deductions, losses and other
items required of the Partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax
purposes and shall use all reasonable efforts to furnish, within ninety (90)
days of the close of each taxable year, the tax information reasonably
required by Limited Partners for federal and state income tax reporting
purposes.



   Section 10.2 | Tax Elections 
---|--- 

A. Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall, in
its sole and absolute discretion, determine whether to make any available
election pursuant to the Code (including the election under Section 754 of the
Code). The General Partner shall have the right to seek to revoke any such
election upon the General Partners determination in its sole and absolute
discretion that such revocation is in the best interests of the Partners.

B. To the extent provided for in Treasury Regulations, revenue rulings,
revenue procedures and/or other IRS guidance issued after the date hereof, the
Partnership is hereby authorized to, and at the direction of the General
Partner shall, elect a safe harbor (the " _LITP Safe Harbor_ " and such
election, the " _Safe Harbor Election_ ") under which the fair market value of
any Partnership Interests issued in connection with the performance of
services after the effective date of such Treasury Regulations (or other
guidance) (such interests, " _Safe Harbor Interests_ ") will be treated as
equal to the liquidation value of such Safe Harbor Interests (i.e., a value
equal to the total amount that would be distributed with respect to such
interests if the Partnership sold all of its assets for their fair market
value immediately after the issuance of such Safe Harbor Interests, satisfied
its liabilities (excluding any non-recourse liabilities to the extent the
balance of such liabilities exceeds the fair market value of the assets that
secure them) and distributed the net proceeds to the Partners under the terms
of this Agreement). In the event that the Partnership makes a Safe Harbor
Election as described in the preceding sentence, each Partner hereby agrees to
comply with all Safe Harbor requirements with respect to transfers of such
Safe Harbor Interests while the Safe Harbor Election remains effective.

---|--- 

A. _General_. The General Partner shall be the "tax partner" of the
Partnership for federal, state and local income tax administrative or judicial

6231(a)(7) of the Code as in effect on November 1, 2015 (Subchapter C of
Chapter 63 of the Code as in effect on November 1, 2015 referred to as the "
_Current Partnership Audit Rules_ ") and the "partnership representative"

Act of 2015 (with the changes to Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code as
made by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 referred to as the " _2015 Budget
Act Partnership Audit Rules_ "). The General Partner is authorized to conduct
all tax audits and judicial reviews for the Partnership. So long as Section
6223(c)(3) of the Current Partnership Audit Rules is in effect, upon receipt
of notice from the IRS of the beginning of an administrative proceeding with
respect to the Partnership, the tax partner shall furnish the IRS with the
name, address, taxpayer identification number and profit interest of each of
the Limited Partners and any Assignees; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
information is provided to the Partnership by the Limited Partners.

 

B. _Powers_. The tax partner is authorized, but not required (and the Partners
hereby consent to the tax partner taking the following actions):



     | (1) | to elect out of the 2015 Budget Act Partnership Audit Rules,
if available; 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | to enter into any settlement with the IRS with respect to
any tax audit or judicial review for the adjustment of Partnership items
required to be taken into account by a Partner or the Partnership for income
tax purposes, and in the settlement agreement the tax partner may expressly
state that such agreement shall bind the Partnership and all Partners, except
that so long as the Current Partnership Audit Rules are in effect, such
settlement agreement shall not bind any Partner (i) who (within the time
prescribed pursuant to the Code and Regulations under the Current Partnership
Audit Rules) files a statement with the IRS providing that the tax partner
shall not have the authority to enter into a settlement agreement on behalf
of such Partner or (ii) who is a "notice partner" (as defined in Section
6231(a)(8) of the Current Partnership Audit Rules) or a member of a "notice
group" (as defined in Section 6223(b)(2) of the Current Partnership Audit

the district in which the Partnerships principal place of business is
located; 
---|---|--- 



     | (4) | to intervene in any action brought by any other Partner for
judicial review of a final adjustment; 
---|---|--- 



     | (5) | to file a request for an administrative adjustment with the

pleading (petition or complaint) for judicial review with respect to such
request; 
---|---|---

without limitation, the following actions to the extent that the 2015 Budget
Act Partnership Audit Rules apply to the Partnership and its current or former
Partners: 
---|---|--- 



     | a. | electing to have the alternative method for the underpayment
of taxes set forth in Section 6226 of the Code, as included in the 2015 Budget
Act Partnership Audit Rules, apply to the Partnership and its current or
former Partners; and

payments to the Partnership for their share of the Partnership level
assessments; and

     | (8) | to take any other action required or permitted by the Code
and Regulations in connection with its role as tax partner. 
---|---|--- 
 

The taking of any action and the incurring of any expense by the tax partner
in connection with any such audit or proceeding referred to in clause (7)
above, except to the extent required by law, is a matter in the sole and
absolute discretion of the tax partner and the provisions relating to
indemnification of the General Partner set forth in _Section 7.7_ shall be
fully applicable to the tax partner in its capacity as such. In addition, the
General Partner shall be entitled to indemnification set forth in _Section
7.7_ for any liability for tax imposed on the Partnership under the 2015
Budget Act Partnership Audit Rules that is collected from the General
Partner.

The current and former Partners agree to provide the following information
and documentation to the Partnership and the tax partner to the extent that
the 2015 Budget Act Partnership Audit Rules apply to the Partnership and its

     | (3) | information and documentation to prove payment of the
attributable liability under Section 6226 of the Code, as included in the 2015
Budget Act Partnership Audit Rules. 
---|---|--- 
 

In addition to the foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 14.1 of this Agreement, the
General Partner is authorized (without any requirement of the consent or
approval of any other Partners) to make all such amendments to this Section
10.3 as it shall determine, in its sole judgment, to be necessary, desirable
or appropriate to implement the 2015 Budget Act Partnership Audit Rules and
any regulations, procedures, rulings, notices, or other administrative
interpretations thereof promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department.

 

C. _Reimbursement_. The tax partner shall receive no compensation for its
services. All third party costs and expenses incurred by the tax partner in
performing its duties as such (including legal and accounting fees and
expenses) shall be borne by the Partnership. Nothing herein shall be construed
to restrict the Partnership from engaging an accounting firm and/or law
firm to assist the tax partner in discharging its duties hereunder, so long
as the compensation paid by the Partnership for such services is reasonable.

 

D. _Survival_. The obligations of each Partner under this _Section 10.3_ shall
survive such Partners withdrawal from the Partnership, and each Partner
agrees to execute such documentation requested by the Partnership at the time
of such Partners withdrawal from the Partnership to acknowledge and confirm
such Partners continuing obligations under this  _Section 10.3_.



   Section 10.4 | Organizational Expenses 
---|--- 

The Partnership shall elect to deduct expenses as provided in Section 709
of the Code.



   Section 10.5 | Withholding 
---|--- 

Each Limited Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to withhold from or pay
on behalf of or with respect to such Limited Partner any amount of U.S.
federal, state, local, or foreign taxes that the General Partner determines

 



47 ##### Table of Contents

  

 that the Partnership is required to withhold or pay with respect to any cash
or property distributable, allocable or otherwise transferred to such Limited
Partner pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any taxes
required to be withheld or paid by the Partnership pursuant to Section 1441,
1442, 1445, or 1446 of the Code. Any amount withheld with respect to a Limited
Partner pursuant to this _Section 10.5_  shall be treated as paid or
distributed, as applicable, to such Limited Partner for all purposes under
this Agreement to the extent that the Partnership is contemporaneously making
distributions against which such amount can be offset. Any amount paid on
behalf of or with respect to a Limited Partner, in excess of any such amount
of contemporaneous distributions against which such amount paid can be offset,
shall constitute a loan by the Partnership to such Limited Partner, which loan
shall be repaid by such Limited Partner within fifteen (15) days after notice
from the General Partner that such payment must be made unless (i) the
Partnership withholds such payment from a distribution which would otherwise
be made to the Limited Partner or (ii) the General Partner determines, in its
sole and absolute discretion, that such payment may be satisfied out of the
available funds of the Partnership which would, but for such payment, be
distributed to the Limited Partner. Any amounts withheld pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) shall be treated as having been distributed or
otherwise paid to such Limited Partner. Each Limited Partner hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Partnership a security interest
in such Limited Partners Partnership Interest to secure such Limited
Partners obligation to pay to the Partnership any amounts required to be paid
pursuant to this _Section 10.5_. Any amounts payable by a Limited
Partner hereunder shall bear interest at the base rate on corporate loans at
large United States money center commercial banks, as published from time to
time in The Wall Street Journal, plus four (4) percentage points (but not
higher than the maximum rate that may be charged under applicable law) from
the date such amount is due (i.e., fifteen (15) days after demand) until such
amount is paid in full. Each Limited Partner shall take such actions as the
Partnership or the General Partner shall request to perfect or enforce the
security interest created hereunder.

TRANSFERS AND WITHDRAWALS



   Section 11.1 | Transfer 
---|--- 

A. _Definition_. The term "transfer," when used in this  _Article XI_ with
respect to a Partnership Interest or a Partnership Unit, shall be deemed to
refer to a transaction by which the General Partner purports to assign all or
any part of its General Partner Interest to another Person or by which
a Limited Partner purports to assign all or any part of its Limited Partner
Interest to another Person, and includes a transfer, sale, merger,
consolidation, combination, assignment, bequest, conveyance, devise, gift,
pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any other
disposition, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or
otherwise. The term "transfer" when used in this _Article XI_ does not include
any redemption or repurchase of Partnership Units by the Partnership from a
Partner or acquisition of Partnership Units from a Limited Partner by the
General Partner Entity pursuant to _Section 8.6_ or otherwise. When used in
this Article XI, the verb "transfer" shall have correlative meaning. No
Partnership Interest shall be subject to the claims of any creditor, any
spouse (for alimony, support or otherwise), or to legal process, and may not
be voluntarily or involuntarily alienated or encumbered except as may be
specifically provided for in this Agreement or consented to in writing by the
General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion.

 

B. _General_. No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in
part, except in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
_Article XI_. Any transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not
made in accordance with this _Article XI_ shall be null and void _ab initio_.

 



   Section 11.2 | Transfers and Withdrawals by General Partner and General
Partner Entity 
---|--- 

A.  _General_. Neither the General Partner nor the General Partner Entity
shall transfer any of its Partnership Interests, and, if the General Partner
Entity is not the General Partner, the General Partner Entity may not transfer
any of its direct or indirect interests in the General Partner, or withdraw
from the Partnership, except (i) in

 



48 ##### Table of Contents

  

 connection with a transaction permitted under _Section 11.2.B_ , (ii) in
connection with any merger (including a triangular merger), consolidation or
other combination with or into another Person following the consummation of
which the equity holders of the surviving entity are substantially identical
to the shareholders of the General Partner Entity, (iii) with the Consent of
the Outside Limited Partners; or (iv) to any Person that is, at the time of
such transfer, an Affiliate of the General Partner Entity that is controlled
by the General Partner Entity, including any Qualified REIT Subsidiary.

 

B. _Termination Transactions_. Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in
_Section 11.2.A_ or any other provision of this Agreement, the General
Partner Entity shall not engage in any merger (including, without limitation,
a triangular merger), consolidation or other combination with or into another
Person, sale of all or substantially all of its assets or
any reclassification, recapitalization or other change in outstanding Shares
(other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or as a
result of a subdivision or combination as described in the definition of
Conversion Factor) (each, a " _Termination Transaction_ "), unless, in
connection with such Termination Transaction:

(1) the General Partner shall have obtained Partnership Approval of the
Termination Transaction, as set forth below, if (x) the Termination
Transaction would result in the Partners receiving consideration for their
Partnership Units pursuant to clause (2) below and the General Partner Entity
is required to seek the approval of its common shareholders of the Termination
Transaction (" _Shareholder Approval_ ") in a shareholder vote (a "
_Shareholder Vote_ "), or (y) the General Partner Entity would be required to
obtain Shareholder Approval of the Termination Transaction but for the fact
that a Tender Offer shall have been accepted with respect to a sufficient
number of Shares to permit consummation of the Termination Transaction
without Shareholder Approval, and

(2) all Partners either will receive, or will have the right to receive, for
each Partnership Unit cash, securities or other property in the same form as,
and equal in amount to the product of the Conversion Factor and the greatest
amount of, the cash, securities or other property paid to a holder of Shares,
if any, corresponding to such Partnership Unit in consideration of one such
Share at any time during the period from and after the date on which the
Termination Transaction is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that if in
connection with the Termination Transaction, a purchase, tender or exchange
offer (a " _Tender Offer_ ") shall have been made to and accepted by the
holders of the percentage required for the approval of mergers under the
organizational documents of the General Partner Entity, each holder of
Partnership Units shall receive, or shall have the right to receive,
consideration equal to the fair market value of the greatest amount of cash,
securities, or other property which such holder would have received had it
exercised the Redemption Right and received Shares in exchange for its
Partnership Units immediately prior to the expiration of such purchase, tender
or exchange offer and had thereupon accepted such purchase, tender or
exchange offer. In connection with any transaction permitted by _Section
11.2B(2)_ , fair market values shall be reasonably determined by the General
Partner as of the time of such transaction.

 

C. _Partnership Approval_. As used above, " _Partnership Approval_ " means
Consent of the Limited Partners holding Class A Units and LTIP Units
representing a Percentage Interest of Class A Units and LTIP Units that equals
or exceeds the percentage of (x) the Shares outstanding or (y) the Shares
cast, as applicable, in the Shareholder Vote ((x) or (y), as applicable, the
" _Required Denominator Shares_ ") required to be voted in favor of the
Termination Transaction in the Shareholder Vote, provided that, for purposes
of determining whether Partnership Approval has been obtained, the Percentage
Interest of Limited Partners consenting to the Termination Transaction shall
be calculated as follows: Such Percentage Interest shall be equal to the sum

   Section 11.3 | Transfers by Limited Partners 
---|--- 

A. _General_. Except to the extent expressly permitted in _Sections 11.3.B_
and _11.3.C_ or in connection with the exercise of a Redemption Right pursuant
to _Section 8.6,_ a Limited Partner (other than the General Partner and the
General Partner Entity, in their capacities as Limited Partners) may not
transfer any portion of its Partnership Interest, or any of such Limited
Partners rights as a Limited Partner, without the prior written consent of
the General Partner, which consent may be withheld in the General Partners
sole and absolute discretion. Any transfer otherwise permitted under _Sections
11.3.B_ and _11.3.C_ shall be subject to the conditions set forth in _Section
11.3.D_ and _11.3.E_ , and all permitted transfers shall be subject to
_Sections 11.4_ , _11.5_ and _11.6_.

B. _Incapacitated Limited Partner_. If a Limited Partner is subject to
Incapacity, the executor, administrator, trustee, committee, guardian,
conservator or receiver of such Limited Partners estate shall have all the
rights of a Limited Partner, but not more rights than those enjoyed by other
Limited Partners, for the purpose of settling or managing the estate and such
power as the Incapacitated Limited Partner possessed to transfer all or any
part of his, her or its interest in the Partnership. The Incapacity of a
Limited Partner, in and of itself, shall not dissolve or terminate the
Partnership.

C. _Permitted Transfers_. Subject to _Sections 11.3.D_ , _11.3.E_ , _11.4_ , 
_11.5_ and _11.6_ , a Limited Partner may transfer, with or without the
consent of the General Partner, all or a portion of its Partnership Interest
(i) in the case of a Limited Partner who is an individual, to a member of his
Immediate Family, any trust formed for the benefit of himself and/or members
of his Immediate Family, or any partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, corporation or other business entity comprised only of himself and/or
members of his Immediate Family and entities the ownership interests in which
are owned by or for the benefit of himself and/or members of his Immediate
Family, (ii) in the case of a Limited Partner which is a trust, to the
beneficiaries of such trust, (iii) in the case of a Limited Partner which is
a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, corporation or other
business entity to which Partnership Units were transferred pursuant to clause
(i) above, to its partners, owners or shareholders, as the case may be, who
are members of the Immediate Family of or are actually the Person(s) who
transferred Partnership Units to it pursuant to clause (i) above, (iv) in the
case of a Limited Partner which acquired Partnership Units as of the date
hereof and which is a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
corporation or other business entity, to its partners, owners, shareholders or
Affiliates thereof, as the case may be, or the Persons owning the beneficial
interests in any of its partners, owners or shareholders or Affiliates
thereof (it being understood that this clause (iv) will apply to all of each
Persons Partnership Interests whether the Partnership Units relating thereto
were acquired on the date hereof or hereafter), (v) in the case of a Limited
Partner which is a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
corporation or other business entity other than any of the foregoing described
in clause (iii) or (iv), in accordance with the terms of any agreement
between such Limited Partner and the Partnership pursuant to which such
Partnership Interest was issued, (vi) pursuant to a gift or other transfer
without consideration, (vii) pursuant to applicable laws of descent or
distribution, (viii) to another Limited Partner, and (ix) pursuant to a grant

50 ##### Table of Contents

  

 encumbrance thereof effectuated in a bona fide pledge transaction with a
bona fide financial institution as a result of the exercise of remedies
related thereto, subject to the provisions of  _Section 11.3.F_ hereof. A
trust or other entity will be considered formed "for the benefit" of a
Partners Immediate Family even though some other Person has a remainder
interest under or with respect to such trust or other entity.

D. _No Transfers Violating Securities Laws_. The General Partner may prohibit
any transfer of Partnership Units by a Limited Partner unless it receives a
written opinion of legal counsel (which opinion and counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Partnership) to such Limited Partner to the
effect that such transfer would not require filing of a
registration statement under the Securities Act or would not otherwise
violate any federal or state securities laws or regulations applicable to the
Partnership or the Partnership Unit or, at the option of the Partnership, an
opinion of legal counsel to the Partnership to the same effect.

E. _No Transfers to Holders of Nonrecourse Liabilities_. No pledge or transfer
of any Partnership Units may be made to a lender to the Partnership or any
Person who is related (within the meaning of Section 1.752-4(b) of the
Regulations) to any lender to the Partnership whose loan otherwise constitutes
a Nonrecourse Liability unless (i) the General Partner is provided prior
written notice thereof and (ii) the lender enters into an arrangement with the
Partnership and the General Partner to exchange or redeem for the Redemption
Amount any Partnership Units in which a security interest is held
simultaneously with the time at which such lender would be deemed to be a
partner in the Partnership for purposes of allocating liabilities to such
lender under Section 752 of the Code.

 



   Section 11.4 | Substituted Limited Partners 
---|--- 

A. _Consent of General Partner_. No Limited Partners shall have the right to
substitute a transferee as a Limited Partner in its place (including any
transferees permitted by _Section 11.3_ ). The General Partner shall, however,
have the right to consent to the admission of a transferee of the interest of
a Limited Partner pursuant to this _Section 11.4_ as a Substituted Limited
Partner, which consent may be given or withheld by the General Partner in its
sole and absolute discretion. The General Partners failure or refusal
to permit a transferee of any such interests to become a Substituted Limited
Partner shall not give rise to any cause of action against the Partnership,
the General Partner or any Partner. The General Partner hereby grants its
consent to the admission as a Substituted Limited Partner to any bona fide
financial institution that loans money or otherwise extends credit to a holder
of Partnership Units and thereafter becomes the owner of such Partnership
Units pursuant to the exercise by such financial institution of its rights
under a pledge of such Partnership Units granted in connection with such loan
or extension of credit.

 

B. _Rights of Substituted Partner_. A transferee who has been admitted as a
Substituted Limited Partner in accordance with this  _Article XI_ shall have
all the rights and powers and be subject to all the restrictions and
liabilities of a Limited Partner under this Agreement. The admission of any
transferee as a Substituted Limited Partner shall be conditioned upon
the transferee executing and delivering to the Partnership an acceptance of
all the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation,
the provisions of _Section 15.11_ ) and such other documents or instruments as
may be required or advisable, in the sole and absolute discretion of the
General Partner, to effect the admission, each in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the General Partner.

 

C. _Partner Registry_. Upon the admission of a Substituted Limited Partner,
the General Partner shall update the Partner Registry in the books and
records of the Partnership as it deems necessary to reflect such admission in
the Partner Registry.



   Section 11.5 | Assignees 
---|--- 

If the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, does not consent
to the admission of any permitted transferee under _Section 11.3_ as a
Substituted Limited Partner, as described in _Section 11.4_ , such transferee
shall be considered an Assignee for purposes of this Agreement. An Assignee
shall be entitled to all the rights of an

 



51 ##### Table of Contents

  

 assignee of a limited partnership interest under the Act, including the
right to receive distributions from the Partnership and the share of Net
Income, Net Loss, gain, loss and Recapture Income attributable to the
Partnership Units assigned to such transferee, and shall have the rights
granted to the Limited Partners under _Section 8.6_ , but shall not be deemed
to be a holder of Partnership Units for any other purpose under
this Agreement, and shall not be entitled to vote such Partnership Units in
any matter presented to the Limited Partners for a vote (such Partnership
Units being deemed to have been voted on such matter in the same proportion as
all other Partnership Units held by Limited Partners are voted). If any such
transferee desires to make a further assignment of any such Partnership Units,
such transferee shall be subject to all the provisions of this _Article XI_ to
the same extent and in the same manner as any Limited Partner desiring to
make an assignment of Partnership Units.



   Section 11.6 | General Provisions 
---|--- 

A. _Withdrawal of Limited Partner_. No Limited Partner may withdraw from the
Partnership other than as a result of a permitted transfer of all of such
Limited Partners Partnership Units in accordance with this _Article XI_ and
the transferee of such Partnership Units being admitted to the Partnership as
a Substituted Limited Partner, or pursuant to redemption of all of its
Partnership Units under _Section 8.6_.

B.  _Termination of Status as Limited Partner_. Any Limited Partner who shall
transfer all of its Partnership Units in a transfer permitted pursuant to this
_Article XI_ where such transferee was admitted as a Substituted Limited
Partner or pursuant to redemption of all of its Partnership Units under
_Section 8.6_ shall cease to be a Limited Partner.

C. _Timing of Transfers_. Transfers pursuant to this _Article XI_ may only be
made upon ten (10) Business Days prior notice to the General Partner, unless
the General Partner otherwise agrees.

 

D. _Allocations_. If any Partnership Interest is transferred during any the
Fiscal Year in compliance with the provisions of this  _Article XI_ or
redeemed or transferred pursuant to _Section 8.6_ , Net Income, Net Loss, each
item thereof and all other items attributable to such interest for such Fiscal
Year shall be divided and allocated between the transferor Partner and the
transferee Partner by taking into account their varying interests during the
Fiscal Year in accordance with Section 706(d) of the Code and corresponding
Regulations, using the interim closing of the books method (unless the General
Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects to adopt a daily,
weekly, or a monthly proration period, in which event Net Income, Net Loss,
each item thereof and all other items attributable to such interest for such
Fiscal Year shall be prorated based upon the applicable method selected by
the General Partner). Solely for purposes of making such allocations, at the
discretion of the General Partner, each of such items for the calendar month
in which the transfer or redemption occurs shall be allocated to the Person
who is a Partner as of midnight on the last day of said month. All
distributions of Available Cash attributable to any Partnership Unit with
respect to which the Partnership Record Date is before the date of such
transfer, assignment or redemption shall be made to the transferor Partner or
the Redeeming Partner, as the case may be, and, in the case of a transfer or
assignment other than a redemption, all distributions of Available Cash
thereafter attributable to such Partnership Unit shall be made to the
transferee Partner.

E. _Additional Restrictions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, and in addition to any other restrictions on transfer
contained herein or in any Equity Incentive Plan, including, without
limitation, the provisions of _Article VII_ and this _Article XI_ , in no
event may any transfer or assignment of a Partnership Interest by any Partner
(including pursuant to _Section 8.6_ ) be made without the express consent of
the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, (i) to any person or
entity who lacks the legal right, power or capacity to own a Partnership
Interest; (ii) in violation of applicable law; (iii) of any component portion
of a Partnership Interest, such as the Capital Account, or rights to
distributions, separate and apart from all other components of a Partnership
Interest; (iv) if the General Partner determines in its reasonable discretion
that there is a significant risk that such transfer would cause a termination
of the Partnership for U.S. federal or state income tax purposes (except as
a result of the redemption or exchange for Shares of all Partnership Units
held by all Limited Partners

 



52 ##### Table of Contents

  

 other than the General Partner, or any Subsidiary of either, or pursuant to
a transaction expressly permitted under _Section 11.2_ ); (v) if the General
Partner determines in its reasonable discretion that there is a significant
risk that such transfer would cause the Partnership to cease to be classified
as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (except as a result of
the redemption or exchange for Shares of all Units held by all Limited
Partners other than the General Partner, or any Subsidiary of either, or
pursuant to a transaction expressly permitted under _Section 11.2_ ); (vi) if
such transfer requires the registration of such Partnership Interest pursuant
to any applicable federal or state securities laws; (vii) if such transfer is
effectuated through an "established securities market" or a "secondary market
(or the substantial equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of Section 7704
of the Code or such transfer causes the Partnership to become a "publicly
traded partnership," as such term is defined in Section 469(k)(2) or Section
7704(b) of the Code ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, this clause (vii) shall
not be the basis for limiting or restricting in any manner the exercise of the
Redemption Right under _Section 8.6_ unless, and only to the extent that,
outside tax counsel provides to the General Partner an opinion to the
effect that, in the absence of such limitation or restriction, there is a
significant risk that the Partnership will be treated as a "publicly traded
partnership" and, by reason thereof, taxable as a corporation); (viii) if such
transfer subjects the Partnership or the activities of the Partnership to
regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors
Act of 1940 or ERISA, each as amended; (ix) if the General Partner Entity
attempts to qualify as a REIT and if the General Partner determines in its
reasonable discretion that there is a risk that such transfer would adversely
affect the ability of the General Partner Entity to continue to qualify as a
REIT or subject the General Partner Entity to any additional taxes under
Section 857, Section 4981, or any other provision of the Code.

F. _Avoidance of "Publicly Traded Partnership" Status_. The General Partner
shall monitor the transfers of interests in the Partnership to determine (i)
if such interests are being traded on an "established securities market" or a
"secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)" within the meaning
of Section 7704 of the Code and (ii) whether additional transfers of interests
would result in the Partnership being unable to qualify for at least one of
the "safe harbors" set forth in Regulations Section 1.7704-1 (or such other
guidance subsequently published by the IRS setting forth safe harbors under
which interests will not be treated as "readily tradable on a secondary market
(or the substantial equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of Section 7704
of the Code) (the " _Safe Harbors_ "). The General Partner shall take all
steps reasonably necessary or appropriate to prevent any trading of interests
or any recognition by the Partnership of transfers made on such markets and,
except as otherwise provided herein, to ensure that at least one of the Safe
Harbors is met; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
authorize the General Partner to limit or restrict in any manner the right of
any holder of a Partnership Unit to exercise the Redemption Right in
accordance with the terms of _Section 8.6_ unless, and only to the extent
that, outside tax counsel provides to the General Partner an opinion to the
effect that, in the absence of such limitation or restriction, there is a
significant risk that the Partnership will be treated as a "publicly traded
partnership" and, by reason thereof, taxable as a corporation.

business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of a date
prior to the date of such order or judgment, of a substitute General Partner.



   Section 13.2 | Winding Up 
---|--- 

A. _General_. Upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the Partnership
shall continue solely for the purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly
manner, liquidating its assets, and satisfying the claims of its creditors and
Partners. No Partner shall take any action that is inconsistent with, or
not necessary to or appropriate for, the winding up of the Partnerships
business and affairs. The General Partner (or, if there is no remaining
General Partner, any Person elected by a majority in interest of the Limited
Partners (the " _Liquidator_ ")) shall be responsible for overseeing the
winding up and dissolution of the Partnership and shall take full account of
the Partnerships liabilities and property and the Partnership property shall
be liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value
thereof, and the proceeds therefrom (which may, to the extent determined by
the General Partner, include equity or other securities of the General Partner
or any other entity) shall be applied and distributed in the following order:



     | (1) | First, to the payment and discharge of all of the
Partnerships debts and liabilities to creditors other than the Partners; 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | Second, to the payment and discharge of all of the
Partnerships debts and liabilities to the General Partner;

each such class or series, to each holder thereof pro rata based on its
Percentage Interest in such class); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (5) | Fifth, the balance, if any, to the Partners, including,
without limitation, the holders of the Vested LTIP Units, in proportion to
their respective positive Capital Account balances, determined after giving

The General Partner shall not receive any additional compensation for any
services performed pursuant to this _Article XIII_ , other than reimbursement
of its expenses as provided in _Section 7.4_.

 

B. _Deferred Liquidation_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 13.2.A_
which require liquidation of the assets of the Partnership, but subject to
the order of priorities set forth therein, if prior to or upon dissolution of
the Partnership the Liquidator determines that an immediate sale of part or
all of the Partnerships assets would be impractical or would cause undue
loss to the Partners, the Liquidator may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
defer for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those
necessary to satisfy liabilities of the Partnership (including to those
Partners as creditors) or distribute to the Partners, in lieu of cash, in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 13.2.A_ , undivided interests in
such Partnership assets as the Liquidator deems not suitable for liquidation.
Any such distributions in kind shall be made only if, in the good faith
judgment of the Liquidator, such distributions in kind are in the best
interest of the Partners, and shall be subject to such

 



55 ##### Table of Contents

  

 conditions relating to the disposition and management of such properties as
the Liquidator deems reasonable and equitable and to any agreements governing
the operation of such properties at such time. The Liquidator shall determine
the fair market value of any property distributed in kind using such
reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt.



   Section 13.3 | Compliance with Timing Requirements of Regulations;
Deficit Capital Accounts 
---|--- 

A.  _Timing of Distributions_. If the Partnership is "liquidated" within the
meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), distributions shall be
made under this _Article XIII_ to the General Partner and Limited Partners
who have positive Capital Accounts in compliance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2). In the discretion of the General Partner a pro rata
portion of the distributions that would otherwise be made to the General
Partner and Limited Partners pursuant to this _Article XIII_ may be: (A)
distributed to a trust established for the benefit of the General Partner and
Limited Partners for the purposes of liquidating Partnership assets,
collecting amounts owed to the Partnership and paying any contingent or
unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Partnership or of the General
Partner arising out of or in connection with the Partnership (in which case
the assets of any such trust shall be distributed to the General Partner and
Limited Partners from time to time, in the reasonable discretion of the
General Partner, in the same proportions as the amount distributed to such
trust by the Partnership would otherwise have been distributed to the General
Partner and Limited Partners pursuant to this Agreement); or (B) withheld to
provide a reasonable reserve for Partnership liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized portion of any installment
obligations owed to the Partnership;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
withheld amounts shall be distributed to the General Partner and Limited
Partners as soon as practicable.

 

B. _Deficit Capital Accounts Upon Liquidation of the Partnership_. If any
Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital Account (after giving effect to
all contributions, distributions and allocations for all taxable years,
including the year during which such liquidation occurs), such Partner shall
have no obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the Partnership
with respect to such deficit, and such deficit shall not be considered a debt
owed to the Partnership or to any other Person for any purpose whatsoever,
except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the affected Partner and
the Partnership after the date hereof.



   Section 13.4 | Rights of Limited Partners 
---|--- 

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Limited Partner
shall look solely to the assets of the Partnership for the return of its
Capital Contributions and shall have no right or power to demand or receive
property other than cash from the Partnership. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, no Limited Partner shall have priority over any
other Limited Partner as to the return of its Capital Contributions,
distributions, or allocations.



   Section 13.5 | Notice of Dissolution 
---|--- 

If a Liquidating Event occurs or an event occurs that would, but for
provisions of an election or objection by one or more Partners pursuant to
_Section 13.1_ , result in a dissolution of the Partnership, the General
Partner shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, provide written notice
thereof to each of the Partners and to all other parties with whom the
Partnership regularly conducts business (as determined in the discretion of
the General Partner).



   Section 13.6 | Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership 
---|--- 

Upon the completion of the liquidation of the Partnership cash and property
as provided in _Section 13.2_ , the Partnership shall be terminated and the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership
as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of
Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to
terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

 



56 ##### Table of Contents

     Section 13.7 | Reasonable Time for Winding Up 
---|--- 

A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding up of the business
and affairs of the Partnership and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to
_Section 13.2_ , to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding-
up, and the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect among
the Partners during the period of liquidation.



   Section 13.8 | Waiver of Partition 
---|--- 

Each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the Partnership property.

 



   Section 13.9 | Liability of Liquidator 
---|--- 

The Liquidator shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership in
the same manner and to the same degree as an Indemnitee may be indemnified

(iv) any amendment that would (x) convert a Limited Partners interest in the
Partnership into a general partners interest, (y) modify the limited
liability of a Limited Partner, or (z) impose on the Limited Partners any

57 ##### Table of Contents

  

 any amendment or waiver requiring the Consent of the Outside Limited
Partners pursuant to _Section 14.1.A_ , the General Partner shall seek the
written Consent of the Partners as set forth in  _Section 14.2_ on such
proposed amendments or waivers or shall call a meeting to vote thereon and to
transact any other business that it may deem appropriate. For purposes of
obtaining a written Consent, the General Partner may require a response
within a reasonable specified time, but not less than seven (7) days, and
failure to respond in such time period shall constitute a vote in favor of the
recommendation of the General Partner. Any such proposed amendment or waiver
shall be adopted and be effective as an amendment or waiver hereto if it is
approved by the General Partner and receives the Consent of the Outside
Limited Partners, as applicable, in accordance with _Sections 14.1.A_.

 

C. _Amendment and Restatement of Partner Registry Not an Amendment_.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Article XIV_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
to the contrary, any amendment and restatement of the Partner Registry by the
General Partner to reflect events or changes otherwise authorized or permitted
by this Agreement, including any adjustments in the number of Class A Units
and Class B Units made in lieu of an adjustment to the Conversion Factor, as
contemplated by the last sentence of the definition thereof, shall not be
deemed an amendment of this Agreement and may be done at any time and from
time to time, as determined by the General Partner without the Consent of the
Outside Limited Partners and without any notice requirement.



   Section 14.2 | Meetings of the Partners 
---|--- 

A. _General_. Meetings of the Partners may be called by the General Partner.
The call shall state the nature of the business to be transacted. Notice of
any such meeting shall be given to all Partners not less than seven (7) days
nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of such meeting.
Partners may vote in person or by proxy at such meeting. Whenever the vote or
Consent of Partners is permitted or required under this Agreement, such vote
or Consent may be given at a meeting of Partners or may be given in accordance
with the procedure prescribed in _Section 14.1.B_. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, the Consent of holders of Partnership
Interests representing a majority of the Percentage Interests of the Class A
Units shall control (including Class A Units held by the General Partner).

B. _Actions Without a Meeting_. Except as otherwise expressly provided by this
Agreement, any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the
Partners may be taken without a meeting if a written consent setting forth the
action so taken is signed by Partners holding Partnership Interests
representing more than fifty percent (50%) (or such other percentage as is
expressly required by this Agreement) of the Percentage Interest of the Class
A Units (including Class A Units held by the General Partner). Such consent
may be in one instrument or in several instruments, and shall have the same
force and effect as a vote of Partners. Such consent shall be filed with the
General Partner. An action so taken shall be deemed to have been taken at a
meeting held on the date on which written consents from the Partners holding
the required Percentage Interest of the Class A Units have been filed with the
General Partner.

C.  _Proxy_. Each Limited Partner may authorize any Person or Persons to act
for him by proxy on all matters in which a Limited Partner is entitled to
participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or
participating at a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the Limited Partner
or its attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of
eleven (11) months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the
proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Limited Partner
executing it, such revocation to be effective upon the Partnerships receipt
of written notice thereof.

 

D. _Votes_. On matters on which Limited Partners are entitled to vote, each
Limited Partner shall have the number of votes equal to the number of Class A
Units held.

E. _Conduct of Meeting_. Each meeting of Partners shall be conducted by the
General Partner or such other Person as the General Partner may appoint
pursuant to such rules for the conduct of the meeting as the General Partner
or such other Person deem appropriate.

F. _Record Date_. The General Partner may set, in advance, the Partnership
Record Date for the purpose of determining the Partners (i) entitled to
Consent to any action, (ii) entitled to receive notice of or vote at any
meeting of the Partners or (iii) in order to make a determination of Partners
for any other proper purpose. Such date, in any case, (x) shall not be prior
to the close of business on the day the Partnership Record Date is fixed and
shall be not more than ninety (90) days and, in the case of a meeting of the
Partners, not less than ten (10) days, before the date on which the meeting
is to be held or Consent is to be given and (y) shall be, with respect to the
determination of the existence of Partnership Approval, the record date
established by the General Partner for the approval of its shareholders for
the event constituting a Termination Transaction. If no record date is fixed,
the record date for the determination of Partners entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of the Partners shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the notice of the meeting is sent, and the record date for any other
determination of Partners shall be the effective date of such Partner action,
distribution or other event. When a determination of the Partners entitled to
vote at any meeting of the Partners has been made as provided in this
section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

   Section 15.14 | Limitation to Preserve REIT Status 
---|--- 

If the General Partner Entity attempts to qualify as a REIT, to the extent
that any amount paid or credited to the General Partner Entity or any of its

7.7_ would constitute gross income to the General Partner for purposes
of Section 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (a " _General Partner Payment_
") then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the amount of
such General Partner Payment for any Fiscal Year shall not exceed the
lesser of:

(i) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) 4% of the General Partner
Entitys total gross income (within the meaning of Section 856(c)(3) of the
Code but not including the amount of any General Partner Payments) for the
Fiscal Year which is described in subsections (A) though (I) of Section
856(c)(2) of the Code over (b) the amount of gross income (within the

Entity from sources other than those described in subsections (A) through (H)
of Section 856(c)(2) of the Code (but not including the amount of any General

Entity from sources other than those described in subsections (A) through (I)
of Section 856(c)(3) of the Code;

 



61 ##### Table of Contents

  

_provided_ , _however_ , that General Partner Payments in excess of the
amounts set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above may be made if the
General Partner Entity, as a condition precedent, obtains an opinion of tax
counsel that the receipt of such excess amounts would not adversely affect the
General Partner Entitys ability to qualify as a REIT. To the extent General
Partner Payments may not be made in a given Fiscal Year due to the foregoing
limitations, such General Partner Payments shall carry over and be treated as
arising in the following year; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such amounts
shall not carry over for more than five Fiscal Years, and if not paid within
such five Fiscal Year period, shall expire; and provided further that (i) as
General Partner Payments are made, such payments shall be applied first to
carry over amounts outstanding, if any, and (ii) with respect to carry over
amounts for more than one Fiscal Year, such payments shall be applied to the
earliest Fiscal Year first.

CAPITAL ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE



   1. | Capital Accounts of the Partners 
---|--- 

A. The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner a separate Capital Account
in accordance with the rules of Regulations Section l.704-l(b)(2)(iv). Such
Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital
Contributions and any other deemed contributions made by such Partner to the
Partnership pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) all items of Partnership
income and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in
accordance with _Section 1.B_ hereof and allocated to such Partner pursuant to
_Section 6.1_ of the Agreement and this _Exhibit B_ , and decreased by (x)
the amount of cash or Agreed Value of property actually distributed or deemed
to be distributed to such Partner pursuant to this Agreement and (y) all items
of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with _Section 1.B_
hereof and allocated to such Partner pursuant to _Section 6.1_ of the
Agreement and this _Exhibit B_.

 

B. For purposes of computing Net Income, Net Loss or the amount of any item of
income, gain, loss and deduction to be reflected in the Partners
Capital Accounts, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, the
determination, recognition and classification of any such item shall be the
same as its determination, recognition and classification for federal income
tax purposes determined in accordance with Section 703(a) of the Code (for
this purpose all items of income, gain, loss or deduction required to be
stated separately pursuant to Section 703(a)(1) of the Code shall be included
in taxable income or loss), with the following adjustments:

(1) Except as otherwise provided in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m),
the computation of Net Income, Net Loss and all items of income, gain, loss
and deduction shall be made without regard to any adjustments to the adjusted
bases of the assets of the Partnership pursuant to Sections 754 of the Code,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the amounts of any adjustments to the adjusted
bases of the assets of the Partnership made pursuant to Section 734 of the
Code as a result of the distribution of property by the Partnership to a
Partner (to the extent that such adjustments have not previously
been reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts) shall be reflected in the
Capital Accounts of the Partners in the manner and subject to the limitations
prescribed in Regulations Section l.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4).

 

(2) The computation of Net Income, Net Loss and all items of income, gain,
loss and deduction shall be made without regard to the fact that items
described in Sections 705(a)(l)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code are not
includible in gross income or are neither currently deductible nor capitalized
for federal income tax purposes.

 

(3) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnerships Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

 

(4) In lieu of the depreciation, amortization, and other cost recovery
deductions taken into account in computing such taxable income or loss, there
shall be taken into account Depreciation for such Fiscal Year or shorter
period.

(5) In the event the Carrying Value of any Partnership asset is adjusted
pursuant to _Section 1.D_ hereof, the amount of any such adjustment shall be
taken into account as gain or loss from the disposition of such asset.

 

(6) Any items specially allocated under _Section 1_ of _Exhibit C_ to the
Agreement hereof shall not be taken into account. 

C. A transferee (including any Assignee) of a Partnership Unit shall succeed
to a pro rata portion of the Capital Account of the transferor in
accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(l).

 



Exhibit B-1 ##### Table of Contents

  

D. (1) Consistent with the provisions of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), and as provided in _Section 1.D(2)_ , the Carrying
Values of all Partnership assets shall be adjusted upward or downward to
reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such
Partnership property, as of the times of the adjustments provided in
_Section 1.D(2)_ hereof, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had
been recognized on an actual sale of each such property and allocated pursuant
to _Section 6.1_ of the Agreement.

 

(2) Such adjustments shall be made as of the following times: (a) immediately
prior to the acquisition of an additional interest in the Partnership by any
new or existing Partner in exchange for more than a de minimis Capital
Contribution; (b) immediately prior to the distribution by the Partnership to
a Partner of more than a de minimis amount of property as consideration for an
interest in the Partnership; (c) immediately prior to the liquidation of the
Partnership within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(g);
(d) immediately prior to the grant of an interest in the Partnership (other
than a de minimis interest) as consideration for the provision of services to
or for the benefit of the Partnership by an existing Partner acting in a
Partner capacity or by a new partner acting in a Partner capacity or in
anticipation of becoming a Partner (including the issuance of any LTIP
Units); and (e) at such other times as permitted or required under
Regulations; _provided_ , _however_ , that adjustments pursuant to clauses
(a), (b), (d) and (e) (to the extent not required by Regulations) above
shall be made only if the General Partner determines that such adjustments
are necessary or appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of the
Partners in the Partnership.

 

(3) In accordance with Regulations Section 1.704- l(b)(2)(iv)(e), the Carrying
Value of Partnership assets distributed in kind shall be adjusted upward
or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to
such Partnership property, as of the time any such asset is distributed.

(4) In determining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss for purposes of this
_Exhibit B_ , the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all
Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents) shall be determined by
the General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may
adopt, or in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to _Article XIII_
of the Agreement, shall be determined and allocated by the Liquidator using
such reasonable methods of valuation as it may adopt. The General Partner, or
the Liquidator, as the case may be, shall allocate such aggregate fair market
value among the assets of the Partnership in such manner as it determines in
its sole and absolute discretion to arrive at a fair market value for
individual properties.

E. The provisions of the Agreement (including this _Exhibit B_ and the other
Exhibits to the Agreement) relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts
are intended to comply with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), and shall be
interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Regulations. In the
event the General Partner shall determine that it is prudent to modify the
manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto
(including, without limitation, debits or credits relating to liabilities
which are secured by contributed or distributed property or which are assumed
by the Partnership, the General Partner, or the Limited Partners) are computed
in order to comply with such Regulations, the General Partner may make such
modification without regard to _Article XIV_ of the Agreement, provided that
it is not likely to have a material effect on the amounts distributable to any
Person pursuant to _Article XIII_ of the Agreement upon the dissolution of the
Partnership. The General Partner also shall (i) make any adjustments that
are necessary or appropriate to maintain equality between the Capital
Accounts of the Partners and the amount of Partnership capital reflected on
the Partnerships balance sheet, as computed for book purposes, in accordance
with Regulations Section l.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(q), and (ii) make any appropriate
modifications in the event unanticipated events might otherwise cause this
Agreement not to comply with Regulations Section l.704-1(b).

 



   2. | No Interest 
---|--- 

No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions or on
balances in Partners Capital Accounts.



   3. | No Withdrawal 
---|--- 

No Partner shall be entitled to withdraw any part of its Capital Contribution
or Capital Account or to receive any distribution from the Partnership,
except as provided in _Articles IV, V,_ _VII_ and _XIII_ of the Agreement.

EXHIBIT C

 

SPECIAL ALLOCATION RULES



   1. | Special Allocation Rules. 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or this _Exhibit C_ ,
the following special allocations shall be made in the following order:

A. _Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding the provisions of  _Section
6.1_ of the Agreement or any other provisions of this _Exhibit C_ , if there
is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year, each
Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for
such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such
Partners share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain, as determined
under Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the
previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts
required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant thereto. The items to be so
allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-2(f)(6). This _Section 1.A_  is intended to comply with the minimum
gain chargeback requirements in Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and for
purposes of this _Section 1.A_ only, each Partners Adjusted Capital Account
Deficit shall be determined prior to any other allocations pursuant to
_Section 6.1_ of the Agreement or this _Exhibit C_ with respect to such Fiscal
Year and without regard to any decrease in Partner Minimum Gain during such
Fiscal Year.

 

B. _Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
_Section 6.1_ of this Agreement or any other provisions of this  _Exhibit C_
(except _Section 1.A_ hereof), if there is a net decrease in Partner Minimum
Gain attributable to Partner Nonrecourse Debt during any Fiscal Year, each
Partner who has a share of the Partner Minimum Gain attributable to such
Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and
gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to
such Partners share of the net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain attributable
to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations
Section 1.704-2(i)(4). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be
made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each
General Partner and Limited Partner pursuant thereto. The items to be so
allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4). This _Section 1.B_ is intended to comply with the minimum gain
chargeback requirement in such Section of the Regulations and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. Solely for purposes of this _Section 1.B_
, each Partners Adjusted Capital Account Deficit shall be determined prior
to any other allocations pursuant to _Section 6.1_ of the Agreement or this
_Exhibit C_ with respect to such Fiscal Year, other than allocations pursuant
to _Section 1.A_ hereof.

 

C. _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in
Regulations Sections 1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), l.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), and after giving effect to the allocations required
under _Sections 1.A_ and _1.B_ hereof with respect to such Fiscal Year, such
Partner has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, items of Partnership income
and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of Partnership income,
including gross income and gain for the Fiscal Year) shall be specifically
allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to
the extent required by the Regulations, its Adjusted Capital Account Deficit
created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as
possible. This _Section 1.C_ is intended to constitute a "qualified income
offset" under Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith.

D. _Gross Income Allocation_. In the event that any Partner has an Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Fiscal Year (after taking into
account allocations to be made under the preceding paragraphs hereof with
respect to such Fiscal Year), each such Partner shall be specially allocated

item of Partnership income, including gross income and gain for the Fiscal
Year) in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required
by the Regulations, its Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.

 



Exhibit C-1 ##### Table of Contents

  

E. _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Except as may otherwise be expressly provided by
the General Partner pursuant to _Section 4.2_ of the Agreement with respect
to other classes of Partnership Units, Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal
Year shall be allocated only to the Partners holding Class A Units and Class B
Units in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests. If the
General Partner determines in its good faith discretion that the Partnerships
Nonrecourse Deductions must be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the
safe harbor requirements of the Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b)
of the Code, the General Partner is authorized, upon notice to the Limited
Partners, to revise the prescribed ratio for such Fiscal Year to the
numerically closest ratio which would satisfy such requirements.

 

F. _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for
any Fiscal Year shall be specially allocated to the Partner who bears
the economic risk of loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to
which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with
Regulations Sections 1.704-2(b)(4) and 1.704-2(i).

 

G. _Adjustments Pursuant to Code Section 734 and Section 743_. To the extent
an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant
to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Regulations
Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain
or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent
with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Regulations.

H. _Forfeiture Allocations_. Upon a forfeiture of any unvested Partnership
Interest by any Partner, gross items of income, gain, loss or deduction shall
be allocated to such Partner if and to the extent required by final Treasury
Regulations promulgated after the date hereof (or, if final
Treasury Regulations have not yet been promulgated, to the extent determined
by the General Partner, in its sole discretion, as necessary) to ensure that
allocations made with respect to all unvested Partnership Interests are
recognized under Code Section 704(b).

I. The allocations set forth in clauses (A) through (F) of this Section 1 ("
_Regulatory Allocations_ ") are intended to comply with certain regulatory
requirements, including the requirements of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b) and
1.704-2. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.1_ of the Agreement, the
Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating other items
of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Partners so that, to the extent
possible without violating the requirements giving rise to the Regulatory
Allocations, the net amount of such allocations of other items and
the Regulatory Allocations to each Partner shall be equal to the net amount
that would have been allocated to each such Partner if the Regulatory
Allocations had not been made.



   2. | Allocations for Tax Purposes 
---|--- 

A. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2_ , for federal income tax
purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated
among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book"
income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1_ of the
Agreement and _Section 1_ of this _Exhibit C_.

B. In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the
Partners as follows:

 

(1) (a) In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable thereto
shall be allocated among the Partners consistent with the principles of
Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the variation between the
Section 704(c) Value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of
contribution (taking into account _Section 2.C_ of this _Exhibit C_ ); and

 



Exhibit C-2 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed
Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its
correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1_
of the Agreement and _Section 1_ of this _Exhibit C_.

 

(2) (a) In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall

 

(i) first, be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the
principles of Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the Unrealized
Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the allocations
thereof pursuant to _Exhibit B_ ;

 

(ii) second, in the event such property was originally a Contributed Property,
be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with _Section 2.B(1)_
of this _Exhibit C_ ; and

(b) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to an Adjusted
Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner its
correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1_
of the Agreement and _Section 1_ of this _Exhibit C_. 

(3) all other items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated
among the Partners the same manner as their correlative item of "book" gain
or loss is allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1_ of the Agreement and _Section
1_ of this _Exhibit C_.

C. To the extent Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 704(c) of the
Code permit a Partnership to utilize alternative methods to eliminate the
disparities between the Carrying Value of property and its adjusted basis, the
General Partner shall, subject to any agreements between the Partnership and
a Partner, have the authority to elect the method to be used by the
Partnership and such election shall be binding on all Partners.

GOVERNANCE

Section 2.1  _TPG_ __ _s Representation on Company Board_.

(a) On the Closing Date, the Company shall promptly cause one (1)
person designated by TPG to be appointed to the Company Board in the manner
provided in the Companys governing documents for filling vacancies on the
Company Board; provided, that, to the extent TPG has not designated one (1)
such person before Closing, the Company shall promptly cause the person to be
appointed to the Company Board when such person is designated by TPG.
Following the Effective Date, subject to _Section 2.1(f)_ , for any meeting
(or consent in lieu of a meeting) of the Companys stockholders for the
election of members of the Company Board, (i) so long as TPG, together with
its Affiliates, Beneficially Owns as of the date of mailing of the Companys
definitive proxy statement in connection with such meeting (the " _Mailing
Date_ ") at least five percent (5%) of the outstanding Common Stock on an as-
converted basis, the Company shall include one (1) person designated by TPG as
a member of the slate of Company Board nominees proposed by the Company Board
for election by the Companys stockholders and, subject to the Company Boards
fiduciary duties, shall recommend that the Companys stockholders vote in
favor of the election of such nominee, and (ii) if TPG, together with its
Affiliates, Beneficially Owns as of the Mailing Date less than five percent
(5%) of the outstanding Common Stock on an as-converted basis, the Company
shall not be required to include any persons designated by TPG as members of
the slate of Company Board nominees. The member of the Company Board
nominated or elected pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_ is referred to herein
as the " _TPG Nominated Director_." The Company Board shall not withdraw any
nomination or, subject to the Company Boards fiduciary duties,
recommendation required under this _Section 2.1(a)_ , unless TPG delivers to
the Company Board a written request for such withdrawal. Further, (i) for any
meeting (or consent in lieu of a meeting) of the Companys stockholders for
the election of members of the Company Board, the Company Board shall not
nominate, in the aggregate, a number of nominees greater than the number of
members of the Company Board, (ii) subject to the Company Boards fiduciary
duties, the Company Board shall not recommend the election of any other person
to a position on the Company Board for which the TPG Nominated Director has
been nominated, and (iii) the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the TPG Nominated Director to be elected to the Company
Board. If elected to the Company Board, the TPG Nominated Director will hold
his or her office as a member of the Company Board for such term as is
provided in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, or until
his or her death, resignation or removal from the Company Board or until his
or her successor has been duly elected and qualified in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company, and applicable Law.

(b) On the Closing Date, the Company shall promptly cause the TPG Nominated
Director to be appointed (i) to the committee of the Company Board called the
Investment Committee (the " _Investment Committee_ ") and (ii) to the
committee of the Company Board called the Compensation,
Succession, Nominating and Governance Committee (the " _Compensation
Committee_ " and together with the Investment Committee, each a " _Committee_
"); _provided_ , that, to the extent TPG has not designated the TPG
Nominated Director before Closing, the Company shall promptly cause such
person to be appointed to the Committees when such person is designated by
TPG. Following such appointment(s), so long as TPG has the right to designate
the TPG Nominated Director pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ the Company Board
shall cause the TPG Nominated Director designated by TPG to serve on the
Committees. For so long as TPG has the right to designate the TPG

 Nominated Director to serve on the Committees, (x) the Company Board shall
maintain a committee called the Investment Committee and a committee called
the Compensation Committee and (y) each Committee may only take action with
the affirmative vote of at least a majority of its members.

(c) If TPG no longer has the right to appoint the TPG Nominated Director
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ , TPG shall cause the TPG Nominated Director to
resign from any Committees on which such TPG Nominated Director serves
effective as of the date that is the earlier of the end of such TPG Nominated
Directors term and six months from the date on which TPGs Beneficial
Ownership fell below the applicable percentage. If TPG no longer has the right
to appoint the TPG Nominated Director pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ , the
number of directors that TPG shall be entitled to designate for nomination or
appointment at any meeting (or consent in lieu of a meeting) of the Companys
stockholders for the election of members of the Company Board or
any Committee thereof shall forever be reduced to zero (even if TPG or its
Affiliates shall subsequently acquire additional shares of Common Stock). The
TPG Nominated Director resigning as a result of the preceding sentence shall
resign as of the date that is the earlier of the end of the TPG Nominated
Directors term and six (6) months from the date on which TPGs Beneficial
Ownership fell below the applicable percentage. In addition, TPG shall cause
the TPG Nominated Director to resign promptly from the Company Board and any
Committees on which the TPG Nominated Director serves if the TPG Nominated
Director, as determined by the Company Board in good faith after consultation
with outside legal counsel, (i) is prohibited or disqualified from serving as
a director of the Company or a member of any such Committees under any rule or
regulation of the SEC, the NYSE or by applicable Law, (ii) has engaged in acts
or omissions constituting a breach of the TPG Nominated Directors duty of
loyalty to the Company and its stockholders, (iii) has engaged in acts or
omissions that involve intentional misconduct or an intentional violation of
Law or (iv) has engaged in any transaction involving the Company from which
the TPG Nominated Director derived an improper personal benefit that was not
disclosed to the Company Board prior to the authorization of such transaction;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the limitations set forth in 
_Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_ , TPG shall have the right to replace
such resigning TPG Nominated Director with a new TPG Nominated Director, such
newly named TPG Nominated Director to be appointed promptly to the Company
Board in place of the resigning TPG Nominated Director in the manner set
forth in the Companys governing documents for filling vacancies on the
Company Board. Nothing in this paragraph (c) or elsewhere in this Agreement
(except _Section 2.1(e)_ ) shall confer any third-party beneficiary or other
rights upon any person designated hereunder as a TPG Nominated Director,
whether during or after such persons service on the Company Board.

 

(d) For so long as TPG has the right to designate the TPG Nominated Director
for nomination to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ above, the
Company Board shall (i) fill vacancies created by reason of death, removal or
resignation of the TPG Nominated Director promptly upon request by TPG and
only as directed by TPG, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in 
_Section 2.1(a)_ above and _Sections 2.1(f)_ and _2.1(g)_ below, and (ii) fill
vacancies created by reason of death, removal or resignation of any director
who is not a TPG Nominated Director (a " _Non-TPG Director_ ") promptly upon
request by the Non-TPG Directors and only as directed by the Non-TPG
Directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such director designated by the
Non-TPG Directors shall, as a condition precedent to his or her nomination,
meet each of the requirements set forth in clauses (i)  (iv) of _Section
2.1(f)_ below (it being understood that, for the purposes hereof, the word
"TPG" appearing in clause (i) thereof shall be replaced with the words
"the Non-TPG Directors"), other than, in the case of any non-independent or
management director, the requirements of clause (iii) thereof. Further, for so
long as TPG has the right to designate the TPG Nominated Director for
appointment to any Committee pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ above, the Company
Board shall appoint and remove the TPG Nominated Director as members of any
such Committee promptly upon request by TPG and only as directed by TPG, and
shall fill vacancies created by reason of death, removal or resignation of
the TPG Nominated Director promptly upon request by TPG and only as directed
by TPG, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in _Section 2.1(b)_ and
_2.1(c)_ above and _Sections 2.1(f)_  and _2.1(g)_ below. So long as TPG has
promptly named a replacement, following any death, removal or resignation of
the TPG Nominated Director, and prior to any the appointment of such
replacement in accordance with this Agreement, the Company Board agrees not
to authorize or take, and agrees to cause each Committee not to authorize or
take, any action that would otherwise require the consent of a TPG Nominated
Director until such time as such newly named TPG Nominated Director has been
so appointed to the Company Board or such Committee.

(e) Each TPG Nominated Director that is elected to the Company Board shall be
indemnified by the Company and its subsidiaries, if applicable, in connection
with his or her service as a member of the Company Board or any Committee to
the fullest extent permitted by Law and will be exculpated from liability for
damages to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Without limiting the
foregoing in this _Section 2.1(e)_ , each TPG Nominated Director who is
elected to the Company Board shall be entitled to receive from the Company and
its subsidiaries, if applicable, the same insurance coverage in connection
with his or her service as a member of the Company Board and any Committee as
is provided for each of the other members of the Company Board or Committee,
as applicable.

 

(f) TPG shall only designate a person to be a TPG Nominated Director (i) who
TPG believes in good faith has the requisite skill and experience to serve as
a director of a publicly-traded company, (ii) who is not prohibited from or
disqualified from serving as a director of the Company pursuant to any rule or
regulation of the SEC, the NYSE or applicable Law, (iii) who meets
the independence standards set forth in Section 303A.02(b) of the NYSE Listed
Company Manual and (iv) with respect to which no event required to be
disclosed pursuant to Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K of the 1934 Act has
occurred. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.1_ ,
the parties hereto agree that members of the Company Board shall retain the
right to object to the nomination, election or appointment of any TPG
Nominated Director for service on the Company Board or any Committee if the
members of the Company Board determine in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that such TPG Nominated Director fails to meet the
criteria set forth above or, with respect to any TPG Nominated Director to be
appointed to the Companys Audit Committee or Compensation Committee, any
other rule or regulation of the SEC, the NYSE or applicable Law that applies
to members of a companys audit committee, governance committee
or compensation committee (including for purposes of Section 16 of the
Exchange Act and Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ ")). In the event that the members of the Company Board
object to the nomination, election or appointment of any TPG Nominated
Director to the Company Board or any Committee pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 2.1(f)_ , the Company Board shall nominate or appoint, as applicable,
another individual designated by TPG as the TPG Nominated Director nominated
for election to the Company Board or appointed to the Committee, as
applicable, that meets the criteria set forth in this _Section 2.1(f)_ and
_Section 2.1(g)_.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.1_ , nothing
shall prevent the Company Board from acting in accordance with its fiduciary
duties or applicable Law or stock exchange requirements. The Company Board
shall have no obligation to nominate, elect or appoint any TPG Nominated
Director if such nomination, election or appointment would violate applicable
Law or NYSE requirements or result in a breach by the Company Board of its
fiduciary duties to its stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not affect the right of TPG to designate an alternative
individual as the TPG Nominated Director nominated for election to the
Company Board or appointed to the Committee, as applicable, subject to the
other terms, conditions and provisions in this _Article II_.

 

(h) For purposes of calculating the Beneficial Ownership of the Companys
outstanding Common Stock owned by TPG and its Affiliates on an as-converted
basis pursuant to this Article II, to the extent shares of the Companys
Capital Stock are issued or become issuable under any outstanding equity
award, the vesting of which remains contingent on the satisfaction of any
performance goals under such award that have yet to be achieved (and whether
or not such goals are deemed to be satisfied as a result of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement), such shares shall be deemed to be not
outstanding and shall be excluded from the denominator in such calculation.

(i) The rights of TPG set forth in this _Section 2.1_ shall be in addition
to, and not in limitation of, such voting rights that TPG may otherwise have
as a holder of capital stock of the Company, subject to _Section 4.1_ below.

Section 3.1 _Registration at Closing_. The Company shall file, within thirty
(30) days of Closing, a Registration Statement registering for sale all of
the Registrable Securities held by the Holders and shall use commercially

the distribution contemplated thereby) and to file a final prospectus
relating thereto. The plan of distribution set forth in the prospectus
included in the Registration Statement shall include such methods of
distribution as reasonably requested by the Holders. For the avoidance of
doubt, such registration shall not be deemed a "Demand Registration" for
purposes of the limitations set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_.

(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, at any time on or after the date that is
180 days after the Closing Date, the Holders of a majority of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to require the Company to file a Registration
Statement registering for sale all or part of their respective Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act (a " _Demand Registration_ ")
by delivering a written request therefor to the Company (i) specifying the
number of Registrable Securities to be included in such registration by such
Holder or Holders, (ii) specifying whether the intended method of disposition
thereof is pursuant to an Underwritten Offering (as defined below), and (iii)
containing all information about such Holder required to be included in such
Registration Statement in accordance with applicable Law. As soon as
practicable after the receipt of such demand, the Company shall (x) promptly
notify all Holders from whom the request for registration has not been
received and (y) use reasonable best efforts to effect such registration
(including, without limitation, appropriate qualification under
applicable blue sky or other state securities Laws and appropriate compliance
with applicable regulations issued under the Securities Act and any other
governmental requirements or regulations) of the Registrable Securities that
the Company has been so requested to register; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) the Holders shall not make a request for a Demand Registration under this
_Section 3.2(a)_ for Registrable Securities having an anticipated aggregate
offering price of less than $5,000,000, (ii) the Holders will not be entitled
to require the Company to effect more than three (3) Demand Registrations in
the aggregate under this Agreement, and (iii) the Company will not be
obligated to effect more than one (1) Demand Registration in any six (6)
month period.

(b) The offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand
Registration may be in the form of an underwritten public offering (an "
_Underwritten Offering_ "). In such case, (i) the Company may designate the
managing underwriter(s) of the Underwritten Offering, provided that such
Holders may designate a co-managing underwriter to participate in the
Underwritten Offering, subject to the approval of the Company, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (ii) the Company shall
(together with the Holders proposing to distribute their securities through
such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form for
underwriting agreements for firm commitment offerings of equity securities
with the managing underwriter(s) proposing to distribute their
securities through such Underwritten Offering, which underwriting agreement
shall have indemnification provisions in substantially the form as set forth
in _Section 3.9_ of this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) the representations
and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to
and for the benefit of the underwriter(s) shall also be made to and for the
benefit of the Holders proposing to distribute their securities through the
Underwritten Offering, (ii) no Holder shall be required to make any
representations and warranties to, or agreements with, any underwriter in a
registration other than customary representations, warranties and agreements
and (iii) the liability of each Holder in respect of any indemnification,
contribution or other obligation of such Holder arising under such
underwriting agreement (a) shall be limited to losses arising out of or based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in such Registration Statement, any such preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement,
incorporated document or other such disclosure document or other document or
report, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for inclusion therein
and (b) shall not in any

 event, absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation, exceed an amount equal
to the net proceeds to such Holder (after deduction of all underwriters
discounts and commissions) from the disposition of the Registrable Securities
disposed of by such Holder pursuant to such Underwritten Offering. No Holder
may participate in any such Underwritten Offering unless such Holder agrees to
sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such underwriting
agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting agreement. The Company shall not be obligated to effect or
participate (a) more than two (2) Underwritten Offerings in any twelve (12)
month period, and (b) in any Underwritten Offering during any lock-up period
required by the underwriter(s) in any prior underwritten offering conducted by
the Company on its own behalf or on behalf of the Holders.

(c) If, in connection with an Underwritten Offering, the managing
underwriter(s) advise the Company that in its or their reasonable opinion the
number of securities proposed to be included in such registration exceeds the
Underwriters maximum number, then (i) the Company shall so advise all Holders
of Registrable Securities to be included in such Underwritten Offering and
(ii) the Company will be obligated and required to include in such
Underwritten Offering only that number of Registrable Securities requested by
the Holders thereof to be included in such registration that does not exceed
such Underwriters maximum number, such Registrable Securities to be allocated
pro rata among the Holders thereof on the basis of the number of Registrable
Securities requested to be included therein by each such Holder. No shares of
Common Stock held by any Person other than Registrable Securities held by the
Holders shall be included in a Demand Registration without the prior written
consent of the holders of a majority in interest of the
Registrable Securities.

(d) A registration will not be deemed to have been effected as a Demand
Registration unless the Registration Statement relating thereto has been
declared effective by the SEC, at least 75% of the Registrable Securities
requested to be included in the registration by the Holders are included in
such registration, and the Company has complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, after it has become effective, (i) such Registration
Statement or the related offer, sale or distribution of Registrable Securities
thereunder is or becomes the subject of any stop order, injunction or other
order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental or administrative
agency, or if any court prevents or otherwise limits the sale of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration, and in each case less
than all of the Registrable Securities covered by the effective Registration
Statement are actually sold by the selling Holder or Holders pursuant to the
Registration Statement, or (ii) if, in the case of an Underwritten Offering,
the Company fails to provide Full Cooperation, then such registration will be
deemed not to have been effected for purposes of clause (ii) of the proviso to
_Section 3.2(a)_. If (i) a registration requested pursuant to this _Section
3.2_ is deemed not to have been effected as a Demand Registration or (ii) the
registration requested pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ does not remain
continuously effective until forty-five (45) days after the commencement of
the distribution by the Holders of the Registrable Securities covered by such
registration, then the Company shall continue to be obligated to effect a
Demand Registration pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ of the Registrable
Securities included in such registration. In circumstances not including the
events described in the immediately two preceding sentences of this _Section
3.2(d)_ , each Holder of Registrable Securities shall be permitted voluntarily
to withdraw all or any part of its Registrable Securities from a Demand
Registration at any time prior to the commencement of marketing of such Demand
Registration, provided that such registration nonetheless shall count as a
Demand Registration for purposes of clause (ii) of the proviso to _Section
3.2(a)_.

Section 3.3 _Piggyback Registration._

 

(a) At any time after the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (as
defined in the Purchase Agreement), if (and on each occasion that) the
Company proposes to register any of its securities under the Securities Act
(other than pursuant to _Section 3.1_ or _Section 3.2_ ) for the account of
any of its security holders and such registration permits the inclusion of
the Registrable Securities (each such registration not withdrawn or abandoned
prior to the effective date thereof being herein referred to as a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "), the Company shall give written notice to all Holders of
such proposal promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the anticipated filing date.

 



10 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) Subject to the provisions contained in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this
_Section 3.3_ and in the last sentence of this paragraph (b), the Company
will be obligated and required to include in each Piggyback Registration such
Registrable Securities as requested in a written notice from any Holder
delivered to the Company no later than five (5) Business Days following
delivery of the notice from the Company specified in _Section 3.3(a)_. The
Holders of Registrable Securities shall be permitted to withdraw all or any
part of their shares from any Piggyback Registration at any time on or before
the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the planned effective date of such
Piggyback Registration, except as otherwise provided in any written agreement
with the Companys underwriter(s) establishing the terms and conditions
under which such Holders would be obligated to sell such securities in such
Piggyback Registration. The Company may terminate or withdraw any Piggyback
Registration prior to the effectiveness of such registration, whether or not
the Holders have elected to include Registrable Securities in such
registration.

(c) If a Piggyback Registration is an Underwritten Offering on behalf of a
holder of Company securities other than Holders, and the managing
underwriter(s) advise the Company that in its or their reasonable opinion the
number of securities proposed to be included in such registration exceeds the
Underwriters Maximum Number, then the Company shall include in such
registration (i) first, the number of securities requested to be included
therein by the Holder(s) originally requesting such registration, (ii) second,
the number of securities requested to be included therein by all Holders who
have requested registration of Registrable Securities in accordance with
_Section 3.3(a)_ , pro rata on the basis of the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included by each such Holder and (iii)
third, any other securities that have been requested to be so included by any
other person.

(d) In any Piggyback Registration that is an Underwritten Offering, the
Company shall have the right to select the managing underwriter(s) for such
registration.

(e) The Company shall not grant to any Person the right to request the
Company to register any shares of Company securities in a Piggyback
Registration unless such rights are consistent with the provisions of this
_Section 3.3_.

pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , _Section 3.2_ or  _Section 3.3_ hereof, the
Company shall pay all of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the registrations thereunder (the " _Registration Expenses_ "), including all
(a) registration and filing fees and expenses, including, without limitation,
those related to filings with the SEC, (b) fees and expenses of compliance
with state securities or blue sky Laws (including reasonable fees and

connection with any Demand Registration. Other than as provided in the
foregoing sentence, the Company shall have no obligation to pay any out-of-
pocket expenses of the Holders relating to the registrations effected pursuant
to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holders shall be
responsible, on a pro rata basis based on the number of Registrable
Securities included in the applicable registered offering by each such
Holder, for any underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the
sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement. The
obligation of the Company to bear the expenses described in this _Section
3.4_ and to pay or reimburse the Holders for the expenses described in this
_Section 3.4_ shall apply irrespective of whether any sales of Registrable
Securities ultimately take place.

within 90 days) after its receipt of the request for registration under
_Section 3.2(a)_ , prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on

(iii) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act applicable to it with
respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the
intended methods of disposition by the Holders set forth in such Registration

(c) The Company will, at least ten (10) days prior to filing a Registration

each preliminary prospectus) and such other documents or information as such
Holder, Holders Counsel or the underwriter(s) may reasonably request in order
to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in accordance with
the plan of distribution set forth in the prospectus included in the

 blue sky Laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder reasonably requests and do
any and all other lawful acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable the Holders to consummate the disposition in such
jurisdictions of such Registrable Securities, and use commercially reasonable
efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption
therefrom) effective during the period which the Registration Statement is
required to be kept effective; _provided_ that the Company will not be

the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable
Securities under state securities or blue sky Laws or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose, and (iv) of the happening of any event that
requires the making of any changes in a Registration Statement or related
prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference therein so that they will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements in the Registration Statement and
prospectus not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they were
made; and, as promptly as practicable thereafter, prepare and file with the
SEC and furnish a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as
thereafter deliverable to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such
prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Holder
hereby agrees to keep any disclosures under subsection (iv) above confidential
until such time as a supplement or amendment is filed.

(g) The Company will furnish customary closing certificates and other
deliverables to the underwriter(s) and the Holders and enter into customary

Registrable Securities.

(h) The Company will make available for inspection by any

(o) The Company shall furnish to any requesting underwriter in an

comfort letters) with respect to events subsequent to the date of the
financial statements, as are customarily covered in opinions of issuers

underwritten public offerings of securities, to the extent that the Company is
required to deliver or cause the delivery of such opinion or comfort letters
to the underwriters in an Underwritten Offering.

(p) In connection with each Demand Registration, the Company shall cause there
to occur Full Cooperation.

 

For purposes of _Section 3.5(a)_ and _Section 3.5(b)_ , the period of
distribution of Registrable Securities in a firm commitment underwritten
public offering shall be deemed to extend until each underwriter has completed
the distribution of all securities purchased by it, and the period of
distribution of Registrable Securities in any other registration shall be
deemed to extend until the earlier of the sale of all Registrable Securities
covered thereby and one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date

Section 3.6 _Holders  Obligations._ The Company may require each Holder to
promptly furnish in writing to the Company such information regarding the
distribution of the Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to
time reasonably request and such other information as may be legally required
in connection with such registration, including all such information as may
be requested by the SEC. Each Holder agrees that, notwithstanding the
provisions of _Section 3.7_ hereof, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in _Section
3.5(f)_  hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities until such Holders receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by _Section 3.5(f)_ hereof,
and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company
all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holders possession
and retained solely in accordance with record retention policies then-
applicable to such Holder, of the most recent prospectus covering such
Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice. In the event the
Company shall give such notice, the Company shall extend the period during
which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective by the number
of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of notice
pursuant to _Section 3.5(f)_ hereof to the date when the Company shall make
available to the Holders a prospectus supplemented or amended to conform with
the requirements of _Section 3.5(f)_ hereof.

 

Section 3.7 _Blackout Provisions._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, by delivery of
written notice to the participating Holders (a " _Suspension Notice_ ")
stating which one or more of the following limitations shall apply

 



14 ##### Table of Contents

  

 to the addressee of such Suspension Notice, the Company may (i) postpone
effecting a registration under this Agreement, or (ii) require such addressee
to refrain from disposing of Registrable Securities under the registration,
in either case for a period of no more than forty-five (45) consecutive days
from the delivery of such Suspension Notice (which period may not be extended
or renewed). The Company may postpone effecting a registration or apply the
limitations on dispositions specified in clause (ii) of this _Section 3.7(a)_
if (x) the Company Board, in good faith, determines that such registration or
disposition would materially impede, delay or interfere with any material
transaction then pending or proposed to be undertaken by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or (y) the Company in good faith determines that the Company
is in possession of material non-public information the disclosure of
which during the period specified in such notice the Company Board, in good
faith, reasonably believes would not be in the best interests of the Company;
_provided_ that the Company may not take any actions pursuant to this _Section
3.7(a)_ for a period of time in excess of ninety (90) days in the aggregate
in any twelve (12)-month period.

(b) If the Company shall take any action pursuant to clause (ii) of _Section
3.7(a)_ with respect to any participating Holder in a period during which the
Company shall be required to cause a Registration Statement to remain
effective under the Securities Act and the prospectus to remain current, such
period shall be extended for such Person by one (1) day beyond the end of such
period for each day that, pursuant to _Section 3.7(a)_ , the Company shall
require such Person to refrain from disposing of Registrable Securities owned
by such Person.

Section 3.8 _Exchange Act Registration._ The Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to timely file with the SEC such information as the SEC may
require under Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all action as may be
required as a condition to the availability of Rule 144 or Rule 144A under
the Securities Act with respect to its Common Stock. The Company shall furnish
to any holder of Registrable Securities forthwith upon request such reports
and documents as a holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any
rule or regulation of the SEC allowing a holder to sell any such Registrable
Securities without registration to the extent that such reports or documents
are not publicly available on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval system or any successor system thereto. Certificates
evidencing Registrable Securities shall not contain any legend at such time as
a Holder has provided reasonable evidence to the Company (including any
customary brokers or selling stockholders letters but expressly excluding
an opinion of counsel other than with respect to clauses (d) or (e) below),
that (a) there has been a sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to an
effective registration statement, (b) there has been a sale of such
Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 (assuming the transferor is not an
affiliate of the Company), (c) such Registrable Securities are then eligible
for sale under Rule 144(b)(i), (d) in connection with a sale, assignment or
other transfer (other than under Rule 144), upon request of the Company, such
Holder provides the Company with an opinion of counsel to such Holder, in a
reasonably acceptable form, to the effect that such sale, assignment or
transfer of the Registrable Securities may be made without registration under
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or (e) such legend is not
required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including
controlling judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued by the SEC).
Following such time as restrictive legends are not required to be placed on
certificates representing Registrable Securities pursuant to the preceding
sentence, the Company will, no later than three (3) Business Days following
the delivery by a Holder to the Company or the Companys transfer agent of a
certificate representing Registrable Securities containing a restrictive
legend and the foregoing evidence (and opinion if applicable), deliver or
cause to be delivered to such Holder a certificate representing such
Registrable Securities that is free from all restrictive and other legends or
credit the balance account of such Holders or such Holders nominee with the
Depository Trust Company (the " _DTC_ ") (if DTC is then offered by the
Company and its transfer agent) with a number of shares of Common Stock equal
to the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the certificate
so delivered by such Holder.

Section 3.9 _Indemnification._

 

(a) _Indemnification by the Company._ The Company agrees, notwithstanding the
termination of this Agreement, to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, each Holder and each of its

 



15 ##### Table of Contents

  

 managers, members, managing members, general and limited partners, officers,
directors, employees and agents, and each Person, if any, who controls such
Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act, together with the managers, members, managing members,
general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents of
such controlling Person (each, a " _Controlling Person_ "), from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, settlement amounts (only if the Company
consented in writing to the settlement, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), liabilities, reasonable attorneys fees, costs and
expenses of investigating and defending any such claim (collectively, "
_Damages_ ") and any action in respect thereof to which such Holder, its
managers, members, managing members, general and limited partners,
officers, directors, employees and agents, and any such Controlling Persons
may become subject to under the Securities Act or otherwise, but only insofar
as such Damages (or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based
upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus of the Company (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or any preliminary prospectus of the Company,
or arise out of, or are based upon, any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, except insofar as the same are based upon information furnished in
writing to the Company by such Holder or any of its managers, members,
managing members, general partners, officers, directors, employees, agents and
Controlling Persons expressly for use therein, and, consistent with
and subject to the foregoing, shall reimburse such Holder, its managers,
members, managing members, general and limited partners, officers, directors,
employees and agents, and each such Controlling Person for any legal and other
expenses reasonably incurred by such Holder, its managers, members, managing
members, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and
agents, or any such Controlling Person in investigating or defending or
preparing to defend against any such Damages or proceedings. In addition to
the indemnity contained herein, the Company will reimburse each Holder for its
reasonable out-of-pocket legal and other expenses (including the reasonable
out-of-pocket cost of any investigation, preparation and travel in connection
therewith) as incurred in connection therewith, as promptly as practicable
after such expenses are incurred and invoiced.

 

(b) _Indemnification by the Holder._ The Holders agree, severally and not
jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors,
employees and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act, together with the managers, members, managing members, general
and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents of such
controlling Person, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the
Company to the Holders, but only with respect to information related to the
Holders, or their plan of distribution, furnished in writing by the Holders
or any of their managers, members, managing members, general partners,
officers, directors, employees, agents and Controlling Persons to the Company
expressly for use in any Registration Statement or prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. No Holder
shall be required to indemnify any Person pursuant to this _Section 3.9(b)_
for any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such Holder from the
sale of the Registrable Securities sold for the account of such Holder.

(c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings._  Promptly after receipt by any
Person (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice of any claim or the commencement
of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section
3.9(a)_ or _Section 3.9(b)_ , the Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against the Person against whom such indemnity
may be sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of the claim or the commencement of such action; _provided_ that the
failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have to an Indemnified Party except to the extent of any
actual prejudice resulting therefrom. If any such claim or action shall be
brought against an Indemnified Party, and it shall notify the Indemnifying
Party thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate
therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other
similarly notified Indemnifying Party, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from
the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the
defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ ,
that 

 



16 ##### Table of Contents

  

 the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel to
represent the Indemnified Party and its Controlling Persons who may be subject
to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be for the account of such Indemnified
Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have
mutually agreed to the retention of, and reimbursement of fees for, such
counsel or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Party
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential conflicts of interest between them, it being
understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with
any one such claim or action or separate but substantially similar or related
claims or actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than
one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at
any time for all Indemnified Parties. No Indemnifying Party shall, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of
any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the
Indemnified Party is or would reasonably have been a party and indemnity
would reasonably have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless
such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party
from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding. Whether or not
the defense of any claim or action is assumed by the Indemnifying Party, such
Indemnifying Party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made without its written consent.

 

Section 3.10 _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Company shall not hereafter
enter into any agreement with respect to any of its securities (including any
registration or similar agreement) which is inconsistent with or violates the
material rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement.

 

Section 3.11 _Lock-Up Agreements._ Each of the Holders and the Company agrees
that, in connection with an Underwritten Offering in respect of which
Registrable Securities are being sold, or in connection with any other public
offering of Common Stock by the Company, if requested by the underwriter(s),
it will enter into customary "lock-up" agreements pursuant to which it will
agree not to, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option
for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any Common Stock or any securities
convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock (subject to customary
exceptions) for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the effective
date of the Registration Statement pertaining to such Registrable Securities
or from such other date as may be requested by the underwriter(s). The Company
further agrees that, in connection with an Underwritten Offering in respect
of which Registrable Securities are being sold, if requested by the managing
underwriter(s), it will exercise its best efforts to obtain agreements (in the
underwriters customary form) from its directors and executive officers not
to, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale
of, or otherwise dispose of, any Common Stock or any securities convertible or
exchangeable into Common Stock (subject to customary exceptions), for a
period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the effective date of the
Registration Statement pertaining to such Registrable Securities or from such
other date as may be requested by the underwriter(s).

 

Section 3.12 _Termination of Registration Rights._ The rights granted under
this _Article III_ shall terminate on the earlier of the date that (a) the
Holders no longer Beneficially Own any Registrable Securities or (b) all
Registrable Securities are eligible for sale without any volume or other
limitations or restrictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the indemnification provisions set forth in _Section 3.9_ shall survive such
termination.

Section 3.13 _Assignment; Binding Effect._ The rights and obligations
provided in this _Article III_ may be assigned in whole or in part by any
Holder to a controlled affiliate of such Holder or to any member, general or
limited partner or stockholder of any such Holder (each, a " _Permitted
Transferee_ ") without the consent of the Company or any other Holder. Such
assignment shall be effective upon receipt by the Company of (a) written
notice from the Holder certifying that the transferee is a Permitted
Transferee, stating the name and address of the Permitted Transferee and
identifying the amount of Registrable Securities with respect to which the
rights under this Agreement are being transferred, and (b) a written agreement
from the Permitted Transferee to be bound by all of the terms of this
_Article III_ as a "Holder." Upon receipt of the documents referenced in
clauses (a) and (b) of this _Section 3.13_ , the Permitted Transferee shall
thereafter be deemed to be a "Holder" for all

compliance with any term of this Agreement may not be waived, except by an
agreement in writing executed on behalf of the party against whom the waiver

following the receipt of Stockholder Approval, the Company Board will not

the right to designate any TPG Nominated Directors to serve on the Committees,
if to the extent that any TPG Nominated Director is not permitted to serve on

 pursuant to the terms and conditions of _Section 2.1(b)_. If TPGs, together
with its Affiliates, Beneficial Ownership of outstanding Common Stock on the
basis of the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, falls
below any percentage threshold set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section
2.1(b)_ above, the number of directors that TPG shall be entitled to designate
for nomination or appointment at any meeting (or consent in lieu of a
meeting) of the Companys stockholders for the election of members of the
Company Board or any Committee thereof shall be reduced to such number that
does not exceed the number that TPG is then entitled to designate for
nomination or appointment pursuant to the terms and conditions of _Section
2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_ above, as applicable, and TPG shall cause one or
more, as applicable, of the TPG Nominated Directors to resign as of the date
that is the earlier of the end of such TPG Nominated Directors term and six
months from the date on which TPGs Beneficial Ownership fell below the
applicable percentage. If, after the date on which TPGs Beneficial
Ownership fell below the applicable percentage and before the effective date
of the TPG Directors resignation in accordance with the preceding sentence,
TPG or its Affiliates acquire additional shares of Common Stock which meet the
percentage thresholds set forth in _Sections 2.1(a)_ and _2.1(b)_ above, then
the number of directors that TPG shall be entitled to designate for nomination
or appointment at any meeting (or consent in lieu of a meeting) of the
Companys stockholders for the election of members to the Company Board or
any Committee thereof shall be increased to the applicable number set forth in
_Sections 2.1(a)_ and _2.1 (b)_ (otherwise, the number of directors that TPG
shall be entitled to so designate shall be forever so reduced, even if TPG or
its Affiliates shall subsequently acquire additional shares of Common Stock).
In addition, TPG shall cause any TPG Nominated Director to resign promptly
from the Company Board and any Committees on which such TPG Nominated
Director serves if such TPG Nominated Director, as determined by the Company
Board in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel, (i) is
prohibited or disqualified from serving as a director of the Company or
a member of any such Committees under any rule or regulation of the SEC, the
NYSE or by applicable Law, (ii) has engaged in acts or omissions constituting
a breach of the TPG Nominated Directors duty of loyalty to the Company and
its stockholders, (iii) has engaged in acts or omissions that involve
intentional misconduct or an intentional violation of Law or (iv) has engaged
in any transaction involving the Company from which the TPG Nominated Director
derived an improper personal benefit that was not disclosed to the Company
Board prior to the authorization of such transaction; provided, however, that,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_
, TPG shall have the right to replace such resigning TPG Nominated Director
with a new TPG Nominated Director, such newly named TPG Nominated Director to
be appointed promptly to the Company Board in place of the resigning TPG
Nominated Director in the manner set forth in the Companys governing
documents for filling vacancies on the Company Board. Nothing in this
paragraph (c) or elsewhere in this Agreement (except _Section 2.1(e)_ ) shall
confer any third-party beneficiary or other rights upon any person designated
hereunder as a TPG Nominated Director, whether during or after such persons
service on the Company Board.

(d) For so long as TPG has the right to designate at least one (1) TPG
Nominated Director for nomination to the Company Board pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ above, the Company Board shall (i) fill vacancies created by reason of
death, removal or resignation of any TPG Nominated Director promptly upon
request by TPG and only as directed by TPG, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_ above and _Sections 2.1(f)_ and
_2.1(g)_ below, and (ii) fill vacancies created by reason of death, removal
or resignation of any director who is not a TPG Nominated Director (a " _Non-
TPG Director_ ") promptly upon request by the Non-TPG Directors and only as
directed by the Non-TPG Directors;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
director designated by the Non-TPG Directors shall, as a condition precedent
to his or her nomination, meet each of the requirements set forth in clauses
(i)  (iv) of  _Section_ _ _ _2.1(f)_ below (it being understood that, for
the purposes hereof, the word "TPG" appearing in clause (i) thereof shall be
replaced with the words "the Non-TPG Directors"), other than, in the case of
any non-independent or management director, the requirements of clause (iii)
thereof. Further, for so long as TPG has the right to designate at least one
(1) TPG Nominated Director for appointment to any Committee pursuant to
_Section 2.1(b)_ above, the Company Board shall appoint and remove the TPG
Nominated Directors as members of any such Committee promptly upon request by
TPG and only as directed by TPG, and shall fill vacancies created by reason of
death, removal or resignation of any TPG Nominated Director promptly upon
request by TPG and only as directed by TPG, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in _Section 2.1(b)_ and _2.1(c)_ above and _Sections
2.1(f)_ and _2.1(g)_  below. So long as TPG has promptly named a replacement,

 following any death, removal or resignation of any TPG Nominated Director,
and prior to any the appointment of such replacement in accordance with this
Agreement, the Company Board agrees not to authorize or take, and agrees to
cause each Committee not to authorize or take, any action that would otherwise
require the consent of a TPG Nominated Director until such time as such newly
named TPG Nominated Director has been so appointed to the Board or such
Committee.

(e) Each TPG Nominated Director that is elected to the Company Board shall be
indemnified by the Company and its subsidiaries, if applicable, in connection
with his or her service as a member of the Company Board or any Committee to
the fullest extent permitted by law and will be exculpated from liability for
damages to the fullest extent permitted by law. Without limiting the
foregoing in this _Section 2.1(e)_ , each TPG Nominated Director who is
elected to the Company Board shall be entitled to receive from the Company and
its subsidiaries, if applicable, the same insurance coverage in connection
with his or her service as a member of the Company Board and any Committee as
is provided for each of the other members of the Company Board or Committee,
as applicable.

 

(f) TPG shall only designate a person to be a TPG Nominated Director (i) who
TPG believes in good faith has the requisite skill and experience to serve as
a director of a publicly-traded company, (ii) who is not prohibited from or
disqualified from serving as a director of the Company pursuant to any rule or
regulation of the SEC, the NYSE or applicable Law, (iii) who meets
the independence standards set forth in Section 303A.02(b) of the NYSE Listed
Company Manual and (iv) with respect to which no event required to be
disclosed pursuant to Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K of the 1934 Act has
occurred. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.1_ ,
the parties hereto agree that members of the Company Board shall retain the
right to object to the nomination, election or appointment of any TPG
Nominated Director for service on the Company Board or any Committee if the
members of the Company Board determine in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that such TPG Nominated Director fails to meet the
criteria set forth above or, with respect to any TPG Nominated Director to be
appointed to the Companys Audit Committee, Governance Committee or
Compensation Committee, any other rule or regulation of the SEC, the NYSE or
applicable Law that applies to members of a companys audit
committee, governance committee or compensation committee (including for
purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ")). In the event that the
members of the Company Board object to the nomination, election or
appointment of any TPG Nominated Director to the Company Board or any
Committee pursuant to the terms of this _Section 2.1(f)_ , the Company Board
shall nominate or appoint, as applicable, another individual designated by
TPG as the TPG Nominated Director nominated for election to the Company Board
or appointed to the Committee, as applicable, that meets the criteria set
forth in this _Section 2.1(f)_ and _Section 2.1(g)_.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.1_ , nothing
shall prevent the Company Board from acting in accordance with their
respective fiduciary duties or applicable Law or stock exchange requirements.
The Company Board shall have no obligation to nominate, elect or appoint any
TPG Nominated Director if such nomination, election or appointment would
violate applicable Law or NYSE requirements or result in a breach by the
Company Board of its fiduciary duties to its stockholders; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not affect the right of TPG to designate
an alternative individual as the TPG Nominated Director nominated for
election to the Company Board or appointed to the Committee, as applicable,
subject to the other terms, conditions and provisions in this _Article II_.

 

(h) The rights of TPG set forth in this Section 2.1 shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, such voting rights that TPG may otherwise have as a
holder of capital stock of the Company.

Section 2.2 _Consent Rights_. __

 

(a) For so long as TPG, together with its Affiliates, Beneficially Owns at
least five percent (5%) of the outstanding Common Stock on the basis of the

contemplated hereby).

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the consent
rights set forth in paragraph (a) above shall not apply, and TPGs prior
written consent shall not be required for any actions taken or to be taken, in
connection with a Change of Control of the Company. The rights of TPG and its
Affiliates set forth in this _Section 3.2_ shall be in addition to, and not
in limitation of, such voting rights that TPG and its Affiliates may otherwise
have as holders of capital stock of the Company.

in each calendar year, and, upon the prior request of TPG, one additional
time within such calendar year, determine whether the Company is a

such examination shall be limited to information filed publicly with the SEC
with respect to the ownership of stock of the Company (i.e., Schedules 13) and
any information related to the ownership of the Company provided by TPG, and
that the Company shall not be required to take any action (or to not take any
action) so as to be treated as a DCR at any given time; _provided_ , _further_
, that TPG shall not request that the Company conduct an examination within
180 days prior to the Companys completion of its most recent prior

(a) For so long as TPG, together with its Affiliates, Beneficially Owns at
least five percent (5%) of the outstanding Common Stock on the basis of the
number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, and subject to any
rules of the NYSE that may limit or restrict such purchases, TPG or one or
more TPG Affiliates designated by TPG shall have the option and right (but not
the obligation) to participate (or nominate any of TPGs Affiliates to
participate) in any Equity Issuance by purchasing in the aggregate up to TPGs
and its Affiliates Pro Rata Portion of such Equity Issuance at the same price
and the same terms and conditions as offered to other investors in the Equity
Issuance.

(b) The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take any and all
action, or to cause such action to be taken, as is necessary or appropriate to
allow TPG or its Affiliate(s), as applicable, to fully participate in any
Equity Issuance in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event the Company proposes to undertake an Equity Issuance, the
Company shall promptly give TPG prior written notice of its intention,
describing the type of equity interests, the price at which such securities

placed offering in which the price is not known at the time the notice is
given, the method of determining the price and an estimate thereof), the
timing of such proposed Equity Issuance and the general terms and conditions
upon which the Company proposes to effect the Equity Issuance. TPG and its
Affiliates shall have fifteen (15) Business Days (or, if the Company expects
that the proposed Equity Issuance will be effected in less than fifteen (15)
Business Days, such shorter period, that shall be as long as practicable, as
may be required in order for TPG and its Affiliates to participate in such
proposed Equity Issuance) from the date TPG receives notice of the proposed
Equity Issuance to elect to purchase their Pro Rata Portion of such Equity
Issuance for the consideration and upon the terms specified in the notice
provided by the Company pursuant to this _Section 3.1(b)_ by giving written
notice to the Company and stating therein the quantity of equity interests to
be purchased. Any such notice shall be irrevocable. Any purchase of Equity

contemporaneously with, and be subject to the same terms and conditions as,
the closing of the sale of the Equity Interests by the Company to the
other parties.

(d) The purchase by TPG and its Affiliates of Equity Interests pursuant to
this _Section 3.1_ shall be subject to the limitations on stock ownership set
forth in the Companys organizational documents; provided, that Company shall
provide any necessary waiver of such limitations upon receipt of a
representation letter from TPG and its Affiliates (or updated representation
letter, as the case may be, similar to the representation letter provided by
TPG and its Affiliates in connection with the Distribution).

 

(e) In the event that neither TPG nor any of its Affiliates exercises the
right forth in this _Section 3.1_ within the applicable period as set forth
above, the Company shall be permitted to sell the equity interests in respect
of which such pre-emptive rights were not exercised. In the event that the
Company has not sold the equity interests within ninety (90) days of
its notice to TPG as contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_ , for purposes of this
_Section 3.1_ such proposed Equity Issuance shall be deemed to have been
terminated, and the Company shall provide TPG with a new notice prior to
undertaking a subsequent Equity Issuance.

(f) The Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, at all times
prior to consummation of any proposed Equity Issuance giving rise to the

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

Section 4.1 _Registration at Closing_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to file, within thirty (30) days of Closing, a
Registration Statement registering for sale all of the Registrable Securities
held by the Holders and, as soon as practicable thereafter, cause such
Registration Statement to become effective (and remain effective until
the completion of the distribution contemplated thereby) and file a final
prospectus relating thereto, subject, in each of the foregoing cases, to the
ability of the Company to satisfy financial statement requirements related to
the closing of the Merger. The plan of distribution set forth in the
prospectus included in the Registration Statement shall include such methods
of distribution as reasonably requested by the Holders. For the avoidance of
doubt, such registration shall not be deemed a "Demand Registration" for
purposes of the limitations set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_.

Section 4.2 _Demand Registration._

(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, at any time on or after the date that is
180 days after the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the
Holders of a majority of Registrable Securities shall have the right to
require the Company to file a Registration Statement registering for sale all
or part of their respective Registrable Securities under the Securities Act
(a " _Demand Registration_ ") by delivering a written request therefor to the
Company (i) specifying the number of Registrable Securities to be included in
such registration by such Holder or Holders, (ii) specifying whether the
intended method of disposition thereof is pursuant to an Underwritten Offering
(as defined below), and (iii) containing all information about such Holder
required to be included in such Registration Statement in accordance
with applicable law. As soon as practicable after the receipt of such demand,
the Company shall (x) promptly notify all Holders from whom the request for
registration has not been received and (y) use reasonable best efforts to
effect such registration (including, without limitation, appropriate
qualification under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and
appropriate compliance with applicable regulations issued under the Securities
Act and any other governmental requirements or regulations) of the
Registrable Securities that the Company has been so requested to register;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Holders shall not make a request for a
Demand Registration under this _Section 4.2(a)_  for Registrable Securities
having an anticipated aggregate offering price of less than $5,000,000, (ii)
the Holders will not be entitled to require the Company to effect more than
three (3) Demand Registrations in the aggregate under this Agreement, and
(iii) the Company will not be obligated to effect more than one (1) Demand
Registration in any six (6) month period.

 



11 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) The offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand
Registration may be in the form of an underwritten public offering (an "
_Underwritten Offering_ "). In such case, (i) the Company may designate the
managing underwriter(s) of the Underwritten Offering, provided that such
Holders may designate a co-managing underwriter to participate in the
Underwritten Offering, subject to the approval of the Company, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (ii) the Company shall
(together with the Holders proposing to distribute their securities through
such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form for
underwriting agreements for firm commitment offerings of equity securities
with the managing underwriter(s) proposing to distribute their
securities through such Underwritten Offering, which underwriting agreement
shall have indemnification provisions in substantially the form as set forth
in _Section 4.9_ of this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) the representations
and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to
and for the benefit of the underwriter(s) shall also be made to and for the
benefit of the Holders proposing to distribute their securities through the
Underwritten Offering, (ii) no Holder shall be required to make any
representations and warranties to, or agreements with, any underwriter in a
registration other than customary representations, warranties and agreements
and (iii) the liability of each Holder in respect of any indemnification,
contribution or other obligation of such Holder arising under such
underwriting agreement (a) shall be limited to losses arising out of or based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in such Registration Statement, any such preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement,
incorporated document or other such disclosure document or other document or
report, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for inclusion therein
and (b) shall not in any event, absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation,
exceed an amount equal to the net proceeds to such Holder (after deduction of
all underwriters discounts and commissions) from the disposition of the
Registrable Securities disposed of by such Holder pursuant to such
Underwritten Offering. No Holder may participate in any such Underwritten
Offering unless such Holder agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the
basis provided in such underwriting agreement and completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities and other documents
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting agreement. The
Company shall not be obligated to effect or participate (a) more than two (2)
Underwritten Offerings in any twelve (12) month period, and (b) in any
Underwritten Offering during any lock-up period required by the
underwriter(s) in any prior underwritten offering conducted by the Company on
its own behalf or on behalf of the Holders.

 

(c) If, in connection with an Underwritten Offering, the managing
underwriter(s) advise the Company that in its or their reasonable opinion the
number of securities proposed to be included in such registration exceeds the
Underwriters Maximum Number, then (i) the Company shall so advise all Holders
of Registrable Securities to be included in such Underwritten Offering and
(ii) the Company will be obligated and required to include in such
Underwritten Offering only that number of Registrable Securities requested by
the Holders thereof to be included in such registration that does not exceed
such Underwriters Maximum Number, such Registrable Securities to be
allocated pro rata among the Holders thereof on the basis of the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included therein by each such Holder.
No shares of Common Stock held by any Person other than Registrable
Securities held by the Holders shall be included in a Demand Registration
without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority in interest of
the Registrable Securities.

 

(d) A registration will not be deemed to have been effected as a Demand
Registration unless the Registration Statement relating thereto has been
declared effective by the SEC, at least 75% of the Registrable Securities
requested to be included in the registration by the Holders are included in
such registration, and the Company has complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, after it has become effective, (i) such Registration
Statement or the related offer, sale or distribution of Registrable Securities
thereunder is or becomes the subject of any stop order, injunction or other
order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental or administrative
agency, or if any court prevents or otherwise limits the sale of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration, and in each case less
than all of the Registrable Securities covered by the effective Registration
Statement are actually sold by the selling Holder or Holders pursuant to the
Registration Statement, or (ii) if, in the case of an Underwritten
Offering, the Company fails to provide Full Cooperation, then such
registration will be deemed not to have been

 effected for purposes of clause (ii) of the proviso to _Section 4.2(a)_. If
(i) a registration requested pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ is deemed not to
have been effected as a Demand Registration or (ii) the registration
requested pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ does not remain continuously
effective until forty-five (45) days after the commencement of the
distribution by the Holders of the Registrable Securities covered by such
registration, then the Company shall continue to be obligated to effect a
Demand Registration pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ of the Registrable
Securities included in such registration. In circumstances not including
the events described in the immediately two preceding sentences of this
_Section 4.2(d)_ , each Holder of Registrable Securities shall be permitted
voluntarily to withdraw all or any part of its Registrable Securities from a
Demand Registration at any time prior to the commencement of marketing of
such Demand Registration, provided that such registration nonetheless shall
count as a Demand Registration for purposes of clause (ii) of the proviso to
_Section 4.2(a)_.

 

Section 4.3 _Piggyback Registration_.

 

(a) At any time after the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), if (and on each occasion that) the Company
proposes to register any of its securities under the Securities Act (other
than pursuant to _Section 4.1_ or _Section4.2_ ) for the account of any of its
security holders and such registration permits the inclusion of
the Registrable Securities (each such registration not withdrawn or abandoned
prior to the effective date thereof being herein referred to as a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "), the Company shall give written notice to all Holders of
such proposal promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the anticipated filing date.

(b) Subject to the provisions contained in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this
_Section 4.3_ and in the last sentence of this paragraph (b), the Company will
be obligated and required to include in each Piggyback Registration such
Registrable Securities as requested in a written notice from any Holder
delivered to the Company no later than five (5) Business Days following
delivery of the notice from the Company specified in _Section 4.3(a)_. The
Holders of Registrable Securities shall be permitted to withdraw all or any
part of their shares from any Piggyback Registration at any time on or before
the fifth business day prior to the planned effective date of such Piggyback
Registration, except as otherwise provided in any written agreement with
the Companys underwriter(s) establishing the terms and conditions under
which such Holders would be obligated to sell such securities in such
Piggyback Registration. The Company may terminate or withdraw any Piggyback
Registration prior to the effectiveness of such registration, whether or not
the Holders have elected to include Registrable Securities in such
registration.

(c) If a Piggyback Registration is an Underwritten Offering on behalf of a
holder of Company securities other than Holders, and the managing
underwriter(s) advise the Company that in its or their reasonable opinion the
number of securities proposed to be included in such registration exceeds the
Underwriters Maximum Number, then the Company shall include in such
registration (i) first, the number of securities requested to be included
therein by the holder(s) originally requesting such registration, (ii)
second, the number of securities requested to be included therein by all
Holders who have requested registration of Registrable Securities in
accordance with _Section 4.3(a)_ , pro rata on the basis of the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities requested to be included by each such Holder
and (iii) third, any other securities that have been requested to be so
included by any other person.

 

(d) In any Piggyback Registration that is an Underwritten Offering, the
Company shall have the right to select the managing underwriter(s) for such
registration.

(e) The Company shall not grant to any Person the right to request the Company
to register any shares of Company securities in a Piggyback Registration
unless such rights are consistent with the provisions of this _Section 4.3_.

Section 4.4  _Registration Expenses._ In connection with registrations
pursuant to _Section 4.1_ , _Section 4.2_ or _Section 4.3_ hereof, the Company
shall pay all of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
registrations thereunder (the " _Registration Expenses_ "), including all (a)
registration and filing fees and expenses,

 



13 ##### Table of Contents

  

 including, without limitation, those related to filings with the SEC, (b)
fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or blue sky laws
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with
blue sky qualifications of the Registrable Securities), (c) reasonable
processing, duplicating and printing expenses, including expenses of printing
prospectuses reasonably requested by any Holder, (d) of the Companys
internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of
its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties, the expense
of any liability insurance and the expense of any annual audit or
quarterly review), (e) fees and expenses incurred in connection with listing
the Registrable Securities for trading on a national securities exchange, (f)
fees and expenses in connection with the preparation of the registration
statement and related documents covering the Registrable Securities, (g) fees
and expenses, if any, incurred with respect to any filing with FINRA, (h) any
documented out-of-pocket expenses of the underwriter(s) incurred with the
approval of the Company, (i) the cost of providing any CUSIP or other
identification numbers for the Registrable Securities, (j) fees and expenses
and disbursements of counsel for the Company and fees and expenses for
independent certified public accountants retained by the Company (including,
without limitation, the expenses of any comfort letters or costs associated
with the delivery by independent certified public accountants of a comfort
letter or comfort letters requested), (k) fees and expenses of any
special experts retained by the Company in connection with such registration,
and (l) reasonable and documented fees and expenses of one firm of counsel for
the Holders to be selected by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities to be included in such registration (" _Holders  Counsel_");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall reimburse the Holders for the
reasonable and documented fees and disbursements one, but not more than one,
additional counsel retained by any Holder for the purpose of rendering any
opinion required by the Company or the managing underwriter(s) to be rendered
on behalf of such Holder in connection with any Demand Registration. Other
than as provided in the foregoing sentence, the Company shall have no
obligation to pay any out-of-pocket expenses of the Holders relating to the
registrations effected pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Holders shall be responsible, on a pro rata basis based on the
number of Registrable Securities included in the applicable registered
offering by each such Holder, for any underwriting discounts and commissions
attributable to the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
Registration Statement. The obligation of the Company to bear the expenses
described in this _Section 4.4_ and to pay or reimburse the Holders for the
expenses described in this _Section 4.4_ shall apply irrespective of whether
any sales of Registrable Securities ultimately take place.

Section 4.5 _Registration Procedures._ In the case of each registration
effected by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall keep
each Holder advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration and
as to the completion thereof. In connection with any such registration:

 

(a) The Company will, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event,
within 90 days) after its receipt of the request for registration under
_Section 4.2(a)_ , prepare and file with the Commission a Registration
Statement on Form S-1, Form S-3 or another appropriate Securities Act form
reasonably acceptable to the Holders, and use reasonable best efforts to cause
such Registration Statement to become and remain effective until the
completion of the distribution contemplated thereby.

(b) The Company will (i) promptly prepare and file with the Commission such
amendments to each Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such
Registration Statement effective for as long as such registration is required
to remain effective pursuant to the terms hereof, (ii) cause the prospectus
to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and, as so
supplemented, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, and
(iii) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act applicable to it with
respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the
intended methods of disposition by the Holders set forth in such
Registration Statement or supplement to the prospectus.

(c) The Company will, at least ten (10) days prior to filing a Registration
Statement or at least five (5) days prior to filing a prospectus or any
amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or prospectus, furnish
to (i) each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement, (ii) Holders Counsel and (iii) each underwriter of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement, copies of such

 



14 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement as proposed to be
filed, together with any exhibits thereto, which documents will be subject to
reasonable review and comment by each of the foregoing Persons within five
(5) days after delivery, and thereafter, furnish to such Holders, Holders
Counsel and the underwriter(s), if any, such number of copies of such
Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case
including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein), the prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including
each preliminary prospectus) and such other documents or information as
such Holder, Holders Counsel or the underwriter(s) may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in
accordance with the plan of distribution set forth in the prospectus included
in the Registration Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company intends to file any prospectus, prospectus
supplement or prospectus sticker that does not make any material changes in
the documents already filed, then Holders Counsel will be afforded such
opportunity to review such documents prior to filing consistent with the time
constraints involved in filing such document, but in any event no less than
one (1) day.

 

(d) The Company will promptly notify each Holder of any stop order issued or
threatened by the SEC and, if entered, use reasonable best efforts to prevent
the entry of such stop order or to remove it as soon as reasonably possible.

(e) On or prior to the date on which the Registration Statement is declared
effective, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to register or
qualify such Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky
laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder reasonably requests and do any and
all other lawful acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable the Holders to consummate the disposition in such
jurisdictions of such Registrable Securities, and use commercially reasonable
efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption
therefrom) effective during the period which the Registration Statement is
required to be kept effective; _provided_ that the Company will not be
required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it
would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph (e), (ii)
subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to
general service of process in any such jurisdiction. 

(f) The Company will notify each Holder, Holders Counsel and the
underwriter(s) promptly and (if requested by any such Person) confirm such
notice in writing, (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-
effective amendment has been filed and, with respect to a Registration
Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC or any other federal or state
governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration
Statement or prospectus or for additional information to be included in any
Registration Statement or prospectus or otherwise, (iii) of the issuance by
any state securities commission or other regulatory authority of any order
suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the
Registrable Securities under state securities or blue sky laws or the
initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, and (iv) of the happening of
any event that requires the making of any changes in a Registration Statement
or related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to
be incorporated by reference therein so that they will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements in the Registration
Statement and prospectus not misleading in light of the circumstances in
which they were made; and, as promptly as practicable thereafter, prepare and
file with the SEC and furnish a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so
that, as thereafter deliverable to the purchasers of such Registrable
Securities, such prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each Holder hereby agrees to keep any disclosures under
subsection (iv) above confidential until such time as a supplement or
amendment is filed.

 

(g) The Company will furnish customary closing certificates and other
deliverables to the underwriter(s) and the Holders and enter into customary
agreements satisfactory to the Company (including, if applicable, an
underwriting agreement in customary form) and take such other actions as are
reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities.

 



15 ##### Table of Contents

  

(h) The Company will make available for inspection by any underwriter
participating in any disposition pursuant to a Registration Statement, and
any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such seller or
underwriter (in each case after reasonable prior notice and at reasonable
times during normal business hours and without unnecessary interruption of
the Companys business or operations), all financial and other records,
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and cause the
Companys officers, directors, employees and independent accountants to
supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter,
attorney, accountant or agent in connection with the Registration Statement.

 

(i) The Company, during the period when the prospectus is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act, promptly will file all documents required
to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.

Securities registered pursuant to the terms hereof to be listed on each

listed.

assist in obtaining of all necessary approvals from FINRA, if any. 

(l) The Company shall provide a transfer agent and registrar for the
Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of such Registration

with the offering of Registrable Securities.

(n) The Company otherwise shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply
with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.

(o) The Company shall furnish to any requesting underwriter in an
Underwritten Offering, addressed to such underwriter, (i) an opinion of the
Companys counsel (which may be the Companys General Counsel), dated the date
of closing of the sale of any Registrable Securities thereunder, as well as a
consent to be named in the Registration Statement or any prospectus thereto,
and (ii) comfort letters and consent to be named in the Registration Statement
or any prospectus relating thereto signed by the Companys independent public
accountants who have examined and reported on the Companys financial
statements included in the Registration Statement, in each case covering
substantially the same matters with respect to the Registration Statement (and
the prospectus included therein) and (in the case of the accountants comfort
letters) with respect to events subsequent to the date of the financial
statements, as are customarily covered in opinions of issuers counsel and in
accountants comfort letters delivered to the underwriters in underwritten
public offerings of securities, to the extent that the Company is required to
deliver or cause the delivery of such opinion or comfort letters to the
underwriters in an Underwritten Offering. 

(p) In connection with each Demand Registration, the Company shall cause there
to occur Full Cooperation.

 

For purposes of _Section 4.5(a)_ and _Section 4.5(b)_ , the period of
distribution of Registrable Securities in a firm commitment underwritten
public offering shall be deemed to extend until each underwriter has completed
the distribution of all securities purchased by it, and the period of
distribution of Registrable Securities in any other registration shall be
deemed to extend until the earlier of the sale of all Registrable Securities
covered thereby and one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date
thereof.

 

Section 4.6 _Holders  Obligations._ The Company may require each Holder to
promptly furnish in writing to the Company such information regarding the
distribution of the Registrable Securities as the Company may from

 



16 ##### Table of Contents

  

 time to time reasonably request and such other information as may be legally
required in connection with such registration, including all such information
as may be requested by the SEC. Each Holder agrees that, notwithstanding the
provisions of _Section 4.7_ hereof, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in _Section
4.5(f)_ hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities until such Holders receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by  _Section 4.5(f)_ hereof,
and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company
all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holders possession
and retained solely in accordance with record retention policies then-
applicable to such Holder, of the most recent prospectus covering such
Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice. In the event the
Company shall give such notice, the Company shall extend the period during
which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective by the number
of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of notice
pursuant to _Section 4.5(f)_ hereof to the date when the Company shall make
available to the Holders a prospectus supplemented or amended to conform with
the requirements of _Section 4.5(f)_ hereof.

Section 4.7 _Blackout Provisions._

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, by delivery of
written notice to the participating Holders (a " _Suspension Notice_ ")
stating which one or more of the following limitations shall apply to the
addressee of such Suspension Notice, the Company may (i) postpone effecting a
registration under this Agreement, or (ii) require such addressee to refrain
from disposing of Registrable Securities under the registration, in either
case for a period of no more than forty-five (45) consecutive days from the
delivery of such Suspension Notice (which period may not be extended or
renewed). The Company may postpone effecting a registration or apply the
limitations on dispositions specified in clause (ii) of this _Section 4.7(a)_
if (x) the Company Board, in good faith, determines that such registration or
disposition would materially impede, delay or interfere with any material
transaction then pending or proposed to be undertaken by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or (y) the Company in good faith determines that the
Company is in possession of material non-public information the disclosure of
which during the period specified in such notice the Company Board, in good
faith, reasonably believes would not be in the best interests of the Company;
_provided_ that the Company may not take any actions pursuant to this
_Section 4.7(a)_ for a period of time in excess of ninety (90) days in the
aggregate in any twelve (12)-month period.

 

(b) If the Company shall take any action pursuant to clause (ii) of _Section
4.7(a)_ with respect to any participating Holder in a period during which the
Company shall be required to cause a Registration Statement to remain
effective under the Securities Act and the prospectus to remain current, such
period shall be extended for such Person by one (1) day beyond the end of
such period for each day that, pursuant to _Section 4.7(a)_ , the Company
shall require such Person to refrain from disposing of Registrable Securities
owned by such Person.

 

Section 4.8 _Exchange Act Registration._ The Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to timely file with the SEC such information as the SEC may
require under Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all action as may be
required as a condition to the availability of Rule 144 or Rule 144A under
the Securities Act with respect to its Common Stock. The Company shall
furnish to any holder of Registrable Securities forthwith upon request such
reports and documents as a holder may reasonably request in availing itself of
any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing a holder to sell any such
Registrable Securities without registration to the extent that such reports or
documents are not publicly available on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval system or any successor system thereto. Certificates
evidencing Registrable Securities shall not contain any legend at such time as
a Holder has provided reasonable evidence to the Company (including any
customary brokers or selling stockholders letters but expressly excluding
an opinion of counsel other than with respect to clauses (d) or (e) below),
that (a) there has been a sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to an
effective registration statement, (b) there has been a sale of such
Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 (assuming the transferor is not an
affiliate of the Company), (c) such Registrable Securities are then eligible
for sale under Rule 144(b)(i), (d) in connection with a 

 



17 ##### Table of Contents

  

 sale, assignment or other transfer (other than under Rule 144), upon request
of the Company, such Holder provides the Company with an opinion of counsel to
such Holder, in a reasonably acceptable form, to the effect that such sale,
assignment or transfer of the Registrable Securities may be made without
registration under the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or (e)
such legend is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities
Act (including controlling judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued
by the SEC). Following such time as restrictive legends are not required to be
placed on certificates representing Registrable Securities pursuant to
the preceding sentence, the Company will, no later than three (3) Business
Days following the delivery by a Holder to the Company or the Companys
transfer agent of a certificate representing Registrable Securities containing
a restrictive legend and the foregoing evidence (and opinion if applicable),
deliver or cause to be delivered to such Holder a certificate representing
such Registrable Securities that is free from all restrictive and other
legends or credit the balance account of such Holders or such Holders
nominee with the Depository Trust Company (the " _DTC_ ") (if DTC is then
offered by the Company and its transfer agent) with a number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the
certificate so delivered by such Holder.

Section 4.9 _Indemnification._

 

(a) _Indemnification by the Company._ The Company agrees, notwithstanding the
termination of this Agreement, to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, each Holder and each of its managers, members,
managing members, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees
and agents, and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act, together with the managers, members, managing members, general and
limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents of such
controlling Person (each, a " _Controlling Person_ "), from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages, settlement amounts (only if the Company
consented in writing to the settlement, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), liabilities, reasonable attorneys fees, costs and
expenses of investigating and defending any such claim (collectively, "
_Damages_ ") and any action in respect thereof to which such Holder, its
managers, members, managing members, general and limited partners, officers,
directors, employees and agents, and any such Controlling Persons may become
subject to under the Securities Act or otherwise, but only insofar as such
Damages (or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based
upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus of the Company (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or any preliminary prospectus of the Company,
or arise out of, or are based upon, any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, except insofar as the same are based upon information furnished in
writing to the Company by such Holder or any of its managers, members,
managing members, general partners, officers, directors, employees, agents and
Controlling Persons expressly for use therein, and, consistent with and
subject to the foregoing, shall reimburse such Holder, its managers, members,
managing members, general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees
and agents, and each such Controlling Person for any legal and other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Holder, its managers, members, managing members,
general and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents, or
any such Controlling Person in investigating or defending or preparing to
defend against any such Damages or proceedings. In addition to the indemnity
contained herein, the Company will reimburse each Holder for its reasonable
out-of-pocket legal and other expenses (including the reasonable out-of-pocket
cost of any investigation, preparation and travel in connection therewith) as
incurred in connection therewith, as promptly as practicable after such
expenses are incurred and invoiced.

 

(b) _Indemnification by the Holder._ The Holders agree, severally and not
jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors,
employees and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act, together with the managers, members, managing members, general
and limited partners, officers, directors, employees and agents of such
controlling Person, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the
Company to the Holders, but only with respect to information related to the
Holders, or their plan of distribution, furnished in

 



18 ##### Table of Contents

  

 writing by the Holders or any of their managers, members, managing members,
general partners, officers, directors, employees, agents and Controlling
Persons to the Company expressly for use in any Registration Statement or
prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary
prospectus. No Holder shall be required to indemnify any Person pursuant to
this _Section 4.9(b)_ for any amount in excess of the net proceeds received
by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities sold for the
account of such Holder.

(c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings._ Promptly after receipt by any
Person (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice of any claim or the commencement
of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section
4.9(a)_ or  _Section 4.9(b)_ , the Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against the Person against whom such indemnity
may be sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of the claim or the commencement of such action; _provided_ , that
the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have to an Indemnified Party except to the extent of any
actual prejudice resulting therefrom. If any such claim or action shall be
brought against an Indemnified Party, and it shall notify the Indemnifying
Party thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate
therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly
notified Indemnifying Party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the
defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to
the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_
, that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
to represent the Indemnified Party and its Controlling Persons who may be
subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity
may be sought by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be for the account of such
Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall have mutually agreed to the retention of, and reimbursement of fees
for, such counsel or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such
Indemnified Party representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interest between them,
it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in
connection with any one such claim or action or separate but substantially
similar or related claims or actions in the same jurisdiction arising out
of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with
appropriate local counsel) at any time for all Indemnified Parties. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which the Indemnified Party is or would reasonably
have been a party and indemnity would reasonably have been sought hereunder
by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim
or proceeding. Whether or not the defense of any claim or action is assumed
by the Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made without its written consent.

 

Section 4.10 _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Company shall not hereafter
enter into any agreement with respect to any of its securities (including any
registration or similar agreement) which is inconsistent with or violates the
material rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement.

 

Section 4.11 _Lock-Up Agreements._ Each of the Holders and the Company agrees
that, in connection with an Underwritten Offering in respect of which
Registrable Securities are being sold, or in connection with any other public
offering of Common Stock by the Company, if requested by the underwriter(s),
it will enter into customary "lock-up" agreements pursuant to which it will
agree not to, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option
for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any Common Stock or any securities
convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock (subject to customary
exceptions) for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the effective
date of the Registration Statement pertaining to such Registrable Securities
or from such other date as may be requested by the underwriter(s). The Company
further agrees that, in connection with an Underwritten Offering in respect
of which Registrable Securities are being sold, if requested by the managing
underwriter(s), it will exercise its best efforts to obtain agreements (in the
underwriters customary form) from its directors and executive officers not
to, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale
of, or

 



19 ##### Table of Contents

  

 otherwise dispose of, any Common Stock or any securities convertible or
exchangeable into Common Stock (subject to customary exceptions), for a period
not to exceed ninety (90) days from the effective date of the Registration
Statement pertaining to such Registrable Securities or from such other date as
may be requested by the underwriter(s).

 

Section 4.12 _Termination of Registration Rights._ The rights granted under
this _Article IV_ shall terminate on the earlier of the date that (a) the
Holders no longer Beneficially Own any Registrable Securities or (b) all
Registrable Securities are eligible for sale without any volume or other
limitations or restrictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the indemnification provisions set forth in _Section 4.9_ shall survive such
termination.

Section 4.13 _Assignment; Binding Effect._ The rights and obligations
provided in this _Article IV_ may be assigned in whole or in part by any
Holder to a controlled affiliate of such Holder or to any member, general or
limited partner or stockholder of any such Holder (each, a " _Permitted
Transferee_ ") without the consent of the Company or any other Holder. Such
assignment shall be effective upon receipt by the Company of (a) written
notice from the Holder certifying that the transferee is a Permitted
Transferee, stating the name and address of the Permitted Transferee and
identifying the amount of Registrable Securities with respect to which the
rights under this Agreement are being transferred, and (b) a written agreement
from the Permitted Transferee to be bound by all of the terms of this
_Article IV_ as a "Holder." Upon receipt of the documents referenced in
clauses (a) and (b) of this _Section 4.13_ , the Permitted Transferee shall
thereafter be deemed to be a "Holder" for all purposes of this _Article IV_.
Except as set forth in this _Section 4.13_ , the rights and obligations
provided in this _Article IV_ may not be assigned by any party hereto without
the prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto.

ARTICLE V

 

COVENANTS

Section 5.1  _No Conflicting Agreements_. For so long as this Agreement
remains in effect, neither the Company nor TPG shall enter into any
stockholder agreement or arrangement of any kind with any Person with respect
to any Shares or other Securities, or otherwise act or agree to act in
concert with any Person with respect to any Shares or other Securities, to the
extent such agreement, arrangement, or concerted act would controvert, or
otherwise be inconsistent in any material respect with, the provisions of
this Agreement.

Section 5.2 _Further Assurances_. Each of TPG and the Company agrees to
execute and deliver all such further documents and do all acts and things

ARTICLE VI

 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 6.1  _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended,
except by an agreement in writing, executed by each of TPG and the Company,
and compliance with any term of this Agreement may not be waived, except by an
agreement in writing executed on behalf of the party against whom the waiver
is intended to be effective. The failure of any party to enforce any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of any
such provision and shall not affect the right of such party thereafter to
enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

Section 6.2  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void, or
otherwise unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent
permitted by Law, shall not be affected and shall remain in full force and
effect. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to
effect the original intent of the parties.

Section 6.3 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, this Agreement, together with the agreements and other documents and
instruments referred to herein, embodies the complete agreement and
understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and supersedes and preempts any prior understandings, agreements, or
representations by or among the parties, written or oral, that may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

 

Section 6.4 _Successors and Assigns._ Except as expressly set forth herein,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations of any party
under this Agreement (including any rights under Article II and Article III
hereof) may be assigned, in whole or in part (except by operation of Law), by
either party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any
such transfer or attempted transfer without such consent shall be null and
void. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which, when taken

Section 6.6 _Remedies._

 

(a) Each party hereto acknowledges that monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy in the event that each and every one of the covenants or
agreements in this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their terms,
and it is therefore agreed that, in addition to, and without limiting any
other remedy or right it may have, the non-breaching party will have the right
to an injunction, temporary restraining order, or other equitable relief in
any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining any such breach and enforcing
specifically each and every one of the terms and provisions hereof. Each party
hereto agrees not to oppose the granting of such relief in the event a court
determines that such a breach has occurred, and to waive any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.

 

(b) All rights, powers, and remedies provided under this Agreement or
otherwise available in respect hereof at Law or in equity shall be cumulative
and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any
thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of
any other such right, power, or remedy by such party.

 

Section 6.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied
(upon telephonic confirmation of receipt), on the first (1st) Business Day
following the date of dispatch if delivered by a recognized next day courier

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the

ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE OR ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, OR SUIT
(WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING, OR
INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT OF, OR BASED UPON, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT
MATTER HEREOF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING. EACH OF THE COMPANY AND TPG ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN
INFORMED BY THE OTHER PARTY THAT THIS _SECTION 6.8(C)_ CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH IT IS RELYING, AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE COMPANY OR TPG MAY
FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 6.8(C)_ WITH ANY COURT
AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

_6.10_ , none of the provisions of this Agreement are for the benefit of, or
shall be enforceable by, any third-party beneficiary.

this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, performance or breach of this
Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and
