## 

  

### (a) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or warranty made

### 

  

## Section 9.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

  

## 

  

### (a) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification
pursuant to this _Article IX_, such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify Sellers in writing. The Purchaser Indemnified Party will
provide Sellers with prompt notice of any third-party claim in respect of
which indemnification is sought. The failure to provide either such
notice will not affect any rights hereunder except to the extent Sellers
are materially prejudiced thereby.

  

### 

  

### (b) If such claim involves a claim by a third-party against the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, Sellers may, upon notice to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, assume, through counsel of Sellers choosing and at Sellers
expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers in connection therewith;
_provided_ that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may participate in such
settlement or defense through counsel chosen by them; _provided_ , _further_
, that if the Purchaser Indemnified Parties reasonably determine that
representation by the counsel of Sellers and the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties may present such counsel with a conflict of interests, then Sellers
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties counsel. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.3_ to the
contrary, Sellers may not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, settle or compromise any action or consent to the entry
of any judgment, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. So long as
Sellers are contesting any such claim in good faith, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall not pay or settle any such claim without Sellers
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If Sellers are not
contesting such claim in good faith, then the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
may conduct and control, through counsel of their own choosing and at
Sellers expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and Sellers shall
cooperate with it in connection therewith. The failure of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties to participate in, conduct or control such defense shall
not relieve Sellers of any obligation they may have hereunder.

  

### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.3, to the
extent a claim for which indemnification is sought by Purchaser Indemnified
Parties relates to Taxes for a taxable period beginning on or before and
ending after the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser shall jointly control
any proceeding in respect of such claim and neither party shall settle or
compromise any action or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld.

  

### 

  

## Section 9.4 _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. The amount of any Loss
for which indemnification is provided under this _Article IX_ shall be (a)
increased to the extent necessary such that after payment of any net Tax cost
by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to the receipt or accrual
of indemnity payments hereunder, as increased pursuant to this clause (a),
the amount remaining shall be the

  



        
   

  



  

## amount of the indemnity payment prior to any increase pursuant to this
clause (a) and (b) reduced by the amount of the net Tax benefit actually
realized by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties by reason of such Loss.

  

## 

  

## Section 9.5 _Indemnification Amounts_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for any Losses pursuant to this _Article IX_ to the
extent they are the result of any breach of any representation or warranty
made by or on behalf of the Company or Sellers unless and until the dollar
amount of all Losses in the aggregate exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000), in which case Sellers will be obligated to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for the total amount of Losses including any
amounts which would otherwise not be required to be paid by reason of this
_Section 9.5_; _provided_  that in no event shall the aggregate
indemnification obligations of Sellers pursuant to Section _9.2_ (a), (b) or
(c) exceed Thirteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($13,500,000) (the
" _Indemnity Cap_ ");  _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties right to seek indemnification
hereunder for any Losses arising out of (i) criminal activity or fraud of
Sellers or the Company or (ii) _Section 3.8_ (Ownership of the Shares),
_Section 3.9_ (Withholding Tax), _Section 4.3_ (Capitalization of the
Company), _Section 4.4_ (Capitalization of the Subsidiaries; Other
Interests), _Section 4.17_ (Environmental), _Section 4.19_ (Employee
Benefits), _Section 4.21_ (Taxes and Tax Returns), _Section 4.22_
(Proprietary Rights) or _Section 4.28_ (No Misleading Statements) shall not
be subject to, or limited by, the limits contained in this _Section 9.5_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to any Losses arising out of 
_Section 3.8_ (Ownership of Shares) and _Section 3.9_ (Withholding Tax),
the liability of any Seller beyond the Indemnity Cap shall be several and not
joint.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller shall have any liability
under this Article IX or otherwise under this Agreement in excess of such
Sellers pro rata portion of the Purchase Price, as set forth on _Schedule
2.2_.

  

### 

  

### (b) For the purpose of calculating the amount of any Loss for which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the amount of each Loss shall be deemed to be an amount net of any
insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
that has been paid by any insurer or other third-party with respect thereto.
The reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel) actually incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties in pursuing any insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment from any insurer or other third-party under this
_Article IX_ shall constitute additional Losses with respect to the matter
for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, except to the extent such
costs and expenses are paid or reimbursed by such insurer or other third-
party.

  

### 

  

## Section 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
the indemnification provisions of this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of Purchaser against Sellers and the Company for any
breach by Sellers or the Company of the representations and warranties in
this Agreement, for any failure by Sellers or the Company to perform
and comply with any covenants and agreements in

  



        
   

  



  

## this Agreement that are required to be complied with or performed prior to
the Closing and for any failure by Sellers or the Company to perform and
comply with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement, except that if
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their terms or are otherwise breached, Purchaser shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms thereof in addition to any other remedy at
law or equity. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Purchaser shall retain the right to receive damages or other relief
(including equitable relief) against the Company or Sellers as a result of
any criminal activity or fraudulent action by the Company or Sellers without
regard to any restriction or limitation contained herein.

brought in such court for jurisdictional purposes, in the Supreme Court of
Massachusetts. Each of the Parties hereby (a) irrevocably submits with regard
to any such action or proceeding to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or
any transaction contemplated hereby and waives the defense of sovereign
immunity, (b) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any
such court or that such action is brought in an inconvenient forum and (c)
agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
any transaction contemplated hereby in any court other than any Massachusetts
state or federal court sitting in Boston, Massachusetts.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parties hereby waives to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Each of the Parties hereby (a) certifies
that no representative, agent or attorney of the other Party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
has been induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 10.8_.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.9 _Actions by Sellers_. Where any provision of this Agreement
indicates that the Company will take any specified action (or refrain from
taking any specified action) or requires the Company to take any specified
action (or to refrain from taking any specified action), then, regardless of
whether this Agreement specifically provides that Sellers will do so, Sellers
shall cause the Company to take such action (or to refrain from taking such
action, as applicable).  Sellers will be responsible for the failure of the
Company to take any such action (or to refrain from taking any such action,
as applicable).

  

## 

  

## Section 10.10 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed
in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but
all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

## Section 10.11 _Titles and Headings_. Titles and headings to sections
herein are inserted for convenience of reference only, and are not intended
to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.12 _Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law,
and if the rights or obligations under this Agreement of Sellers on the one
hand and Purchaser on the other hand will not be materially and adversely
affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b)
this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid,
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c)
the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
provision or by its severance from this Agreement and (d) in lieu of such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.13 _Publicity_. The Parties agree that except as
otherwise required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange, no Party shall issue any press release or
otherwise make any public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements without prior
consultation with and consent of the Company, Purchaser and Sellers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.14 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult
to determine, and that the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance
of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

  

## 

  

## Section 10.15 _Construction_.

in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, qualified or
supplemented, including

  



        
   

  



  

### (in the case of agreements and instruments) by waiver or consent and (in
the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

  

### 

  

### (d) All article, section, paragraph, schedule and exhibit references used
in this Agreement are to articles, sections, paragraphs, schedules and
exhibits to this Agreement unless otherwise specified.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Parties acknowledge that each Party and its attorney has reviewed
this Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that
any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party, or any similar
rule operating against the drafter of an agreement, shall not be applicable
to the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.
