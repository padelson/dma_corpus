-2- ARTICLE III

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;

 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

3.1  _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the holder
of any capital stock of the Company:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Class A common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case
not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by
stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have timely and properly
demanded appraisal, and have not withdrawn such demand, in each case, pursuant
to and in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (each, an " _Excluded Share_
" and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the right
to receive $5.43 per Share in cash and without interest (the " _Per Share
Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall automatically cease to
exist, and (i) each certificate formerly representing any of the Shares (a "
_Certificate_ ") (other than Excluded Shares) and (ii) each non-certificated
Share represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (other than Excluded
Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, without interest. 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share (other than any
such Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of such Excluded Share, cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and
cease to exist, subject, in the case of Excluded Shares held by Dissenting
Stockholders, to any rights the holder thereof may have under Section 3.2(f).

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.00001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall select a paying agent, with the Companys prior approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), that is a U.S.-based
commercial bank or trust company organized and doing business under the Laws
of the United States or any state thereof (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and engage
the Paying Agent pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company. Immediately prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of

 



-3-  the holders of Shares, a cash amount of immediately available funds in U.S.
Dollars necessary for the Paying Agent to make all payments under Section
3.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
The Exchange Fund shall be used solely for the purposes of paying the Per
Share Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article III and shall not
be used to satisfy any other obligations of Parent or any of its Affiliates.
The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ that, such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed
by, the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, and no such investment shall have a maturity
exceeding three months. No such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares. To
the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall promptly replace or restore, or
cause to be replaced or restored, the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through
such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at
all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
Section 3.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection with the exchange of Shares for the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within two Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Shares shall pass, only upon delivery to the Paying Agent of (A) in the case
of certificated Shares, the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)) or (B) in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, a customary "agents message" in accordance with the instructions set
forth in the letter of transmittal (such letter of transmittal and
"agents message" shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
Section 3.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal, and, if applicable,
upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form,
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
3.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 3.2(e)) or
Book-Entry Share, as the case may be, _multiplied by_ (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof in accordance with Section 3.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event
of a 

 



-4-  transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Per Share Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article III upon
surrender of any Shares shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 3.2(e)) is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the
holder of the Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article III.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 270 days after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(g)) in accordance with
this Article III. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount and upon such terms as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation reasonably direct, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the
amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) equal to the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
_multiplied by_ the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has timely and properly demanded
appraisal of his, her or its Shares pursuant to and in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person (such Shares, "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due to such

 



-5-  Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (or any successor
provision) (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the
rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, or any successor provision),
unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn such demand or lost its, his or her rights to appraisal
under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right, such holders Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Share, in
accordance with Section 3.1, without interest. The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals
of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law
that are received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and Proceedings
with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL and may settle any such
Proceedings on behalf of itself and the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not enter into any settlement or make any
commitment with respect to such demands for appraisal that requires a payment
or other action by the Company prior to Closing. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent or except as required by Law
or in accordance with any judgment of a court, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Equity Awards
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares or Company Equity
Awards, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

 

3.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_. Subject to Section 3.3(e), following the
Effective Time, the Parent shall maintain the terms of the Companys Stock
Plans solely to the extent necessary to effectuate, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates to effectuate, the treatment of the
Company Equity Awards outstanding as of the Effective Time pursuant to
the following Sections 3.3(b), 3.3(c), and 3.3(d) in a manner such that the
Company Equity Awards shall, to the extent contemplated by this Agreement, be
deemed by the Company Compensation Committee to have been "Assumed and
Maintained" by a "Successor Entity," as contemplated by the Stock Plans:

(a) _Treatment of Options and SARs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") and each outstanding
Company stock appreciation right (a " _Company SAR_ ") under the Stock Plans,
whether 

 



-6-  vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to, for each Company
Option or Company SAR, whether vested or unvested, as of the Effective Time,
the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Per Share Merger
Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of such Company Option or
Company SAR, and (B) the number of Shares underlying such Company Option or
Company SAR, payable in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in no event later than 30 Business Days following
the Effective Time). For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option or
Company SAR which has an exercise price per Share that is greater than or
equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

(b) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock
unit (a " _Company RSU_ ") under the Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested,
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into only the right to receive
(without interest), an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of Shares
subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, which amount shall vest and be
payable at the time or times provided by and subject to the terms applicable
to such Company RSU; provided that, with respect to any Company RSU that
provides for payment to be made at the Effective Time, such amount shall be
payable in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time (and in no event later than 30 Business Days following the Effective
Time); _provided_ further, that any unvested Company RSU for which the
applicable award agreement does not require automatic vesting upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time shall remain subject to the same vesting
schedule and other relevant terms as in effect immediately before the
Effective Time and the holder of such Company RSU must remain in service to
Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates through the applicable vesting
date (which includes the vesting dates designated in the award agreement
pertaining to such Company RSU, as well as the date or dates to which vesting
may be accelerated in connection with the occurrence of certain events,
including without limitation, termination of employment, pursuant to such
award agreement) to receive payment in respect thereof.

 

(c) _Company PSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding performance stock
unit or Company RSU subject to performance vesting conditions (in each case,
a " _Company PSU_ ") under the Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into only the right to receive (without
interest), an amount in cash, equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to
such Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y)
the Per Share Merger Consideration. The number of Company PSUs in the
preceding clause (x) will be determined based on, (A) in the case of Company
PSUs granted during 2015, target performance, subject to proration for the
portion of the performance period elapsed through the Effective Time; (B) in
the case of Company PSUs granted during 2016, but prior to the date of this
Agreement, the greater of target and actual performance as of the Effective
Time; and (C) in the case of any Company PSUs granted on or after the date of
this Agreement, actual performance as of the date performance is measured as
prescribed by the applicable award agreement. Any determination of actual
performance in respect of Company PSUs granted during 2016 shall be made by
the compensation committee of the 

 



-7-  Company Board (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ "), based on actual
performance as of the Effective Time, determined through a date no earlier
than five Business Days prior to the Effective Time. Amounts payable in
respect of each former Company PSU shall vest and be payable (1) in the case
of Company PSUs granted during 2015, at the Effective Time, and (2) in the
case of all other Company PSUs, at the time or times provided by and subject
to the terms applicable to such Company PSU; _provided_ that, with respect to
any Company PSU in respect of which payment is to be made at the Effective
Time, such amount shall be payable in a lump sum as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than 30 Business
Days following the Effective Time); _provided_ _further_ , that any other
Company PSU for which neither this Agreement nor the applicable
award agreement requires automatic vesting upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time shall remain subject to the same vesting schedule and other
relevant terms (including, without limitation, any terms that provide for pro-
rated vesting in connection with termination of employment) as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time and the holder of such Company PSU must
remain in service to Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates through
the applicable vesting date (which includes the vesting dates designated in
the award agreement pertaining to such Company PSU, as well as the date or
dates to which vesting may be accelerated in connection with the occurrence of
certain events, including without limitation, termination of
employment, pursuant to such award agreement) to receive payment in respect
thereof.

(d) _Other Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by
the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may
be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the
Stock Plans and any other Company Plans, other than Company Options, Company
SARs, Company RSUs and Company PSUs (a " _Company Award_ "), whether vested or
unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into only the right to acquire
or receive (without interest), an amount in cash equal to, (i) for each
Company Award that is vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time, the
product of (A) the number of Shares subject to such Company Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (or, to the extent such Company Award provides for payments to
the extent the value of the Shares exceeds a specified reference price, the
excess, if any, of (1) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (2) such
reference price), which shall be payable at the time or times provided by and
subject to the terms applicable to such Company Award; provided that, with
respect to any Company Award that provides for payment to be made at the
Effective Time, such amount shall be payable in a lump sum as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than
30 Business Days following the Effective Time) and (ii) for each Company
Award that is not vested as of the Effective Time, for which the applicable
award agreement does not require automatic vesting upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of
Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, to the extent such
Company Award provides for payments to the extent the value of the Shares
exceeds a specified reference price, the excess, if any, of (1) the Per Share
Merger Consideration over (2) such reference price), payable at the time or
times provided by and subject to the terms applicable to such Company Award
(or, if the Company Award requires the holder thereof to exercise the Company
Award, no later than 30 Business

 



-8-  Days after the applicable vesting date of such former Company Award);
provided that, any such unvested Company Award shall remain subject to the
same vesting schedule and other relevant terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time and the holder of such Company Award must remain in
service to Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates through the
applicable vesting date (which includes the vesting dates designated in
the award agreement pertaining to such Company Award, as well as the date or
dates to which vesting may be accelerated in connection with the occurrence of
certain events, including without limitation, termination of employment,
pursuant to such award agreement) to receive payment in respect thereof. The
foregoing conversion shall be determined and interpreted in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Company Award that has a reference price per Share
that is greater than or equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

 

(e) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Company Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate
the treatment of the Company Options, Company SARs, Company RSUs, Company PSUs
and Company Awards (the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") pursuant to Section
3.3(a) through Section 3.3(d). The Company shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or shares of other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Equity Awards.

3.4  _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

copies thereof as in effect on the date hereof. The Company has provided or
otherwise made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of the
Significant Subsidiaries Fundamental Documents, each as in effect on the date

4.2  _Capital Structure_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,500,000,000

to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation by it of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to which it is a party will not, constitute or
result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Fundamental

4.5 _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), since December 31, 2013
(the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements, reports and documents
filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto,
the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its
filing or being furnished or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, complied when filed or furnished (or, if applicable, when amended)
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading.

 

(b) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal controls over
financial reporting are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ "), (ii) that receipts and expenditures of the Company
are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on its financial statements. The Company has
disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer
and its chief financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) any
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal controls
over financial reporting that are 

 



-13-  reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for the
Companys auditors and audit committee of the Company Board any material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. The Company has provided or otherwise made available to Parent any
such disclosure (or a summary thereof) made by management to the Companys
auditors and audit committee since the Applicable Date. To the Knowledge of
the Company, since the Applicable Date, the Company has not received any
written complaints from any source, or oral complaints through the Companys
whistleblower hot line or equivalent system for receipt of employee
concerns regarding possible violations of Law, in each case that are
reasonably credible and relate to accounting, internal accounting controls or
auditing matters and allege matters that, if true, would be reasonably likely
to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Since
the Applicable Date, no attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities Laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Companys chief legal officer, audit
committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of the Company
Board or the Company Board pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section
307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating such
reporting. For the purposes of this Section 4.5(b), the terms "significant
deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them
in Appendix A of Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) (i) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the
date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and (ii) each of the consolidated
statements of income, changes in equity and cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents, or in the case of Company Reports filed
after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in all material
respects the results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in
financial position, as the case may be, of such companies for the periods set
forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of
full footnote disclosure and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not
be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein.

(d) Since the Applicable Date, Genworth Canada has timely filed true and
correct copies of all forms, reports, schedules, statements, certifications
and other documents (including "documents affecting the rights of
securityholders" and "material contracts" required to be filed by Part 12 of
National Instrument 51-102  Continuous Disclosure Obligations) required to be
filed by Genworth Canada pursuant to Canadian Securities Laws (the forms,
reports, schedules, statements, certifications and other documents filed
since the Applicable Date and those filed subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _Canada Reports_ "). As of
the date hereof, each of the Canada 

 



-14-  Reports at the time filed (or if amended, at the time amended) (i) did not
contain any misrepresentation (within the meaning of Canadian Securities
Laws); and (ii) complied in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable Canadian Securities Laws. Any amendments to the Canada Reports
required to be made have been filed on a timely basis with the applicable
Canadian Securities Authority. Genworth Canada has not filed any confidential
material change report with any Canadian Securities Authority which remains
confidential or any other confidential filings (including redacted filings)
filed under Canadian Securities Laws or with any Canadian Securities
Authority.

 

(e) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters from
any Canadian Securities Authority with respect to any of the Canada Reports
and neither Genworth Canada nor any of the Canada Reports is the subject of
any pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, audit, review,
comment or investigation by any Canadian Securities Authority or the Toronto
Stock Exchange.

(f) The management of Genworth Canada has established and maintains a system
of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in National
Instrument 52-109  Certification of Disclosure in Issuers Annual and Interim
Filings) designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed by Genworth Canada in its annual filings, interim filings or
other reports filed or submitted by it under the applicable Canadian
Securities Laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified by such Canadian Securities Laws. Such disclosure
controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by Genworth Canada in its annual
filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted under the
applicable Canadian Securities Laws is accumulated and communicated to
Genworth Canadas management, including its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer (or Persons performing similar functions), as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Genworth Canada
maintains internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined
in National Instrument 52-109  Certification of Disclosure in Issuers Annual

6.1(a)(ii), (iii), (v), (vi), (vii), (ix), (x), (xiii), (xiv), (xv), (xvi),
(xvii), (xx), (xxii) and (xxiii) and, solely with respect to the foregoing

by this Agreement.

4.8 _Employee Benefits_. __

 

(a) Section 4.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate and
complete list of each material Company Plan and separately identifies each
Company Plan that is maintained primarily for the benefit of employees outside
of the United States (a " _Non-U.S. Company Plan_ "). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Company Plan_ " means any benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, practice, Contract or other obligation, whether or not in
writing, whether or not material and whether or not funded, in each case, for
the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director, which is
sponsored or maintained by, or required to be contributed to, or with respect
to which any potential liability is borne by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Company Plans include, but are not limited to, "employee
benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA (" _ERISA Plans_
"), employment, consulting, retirement, severance, termination or change in
control agreements, deferred compensation, equity-based, incentive, bonus,
supplemental retirement, profit sharing, insurance, medical, welfare, fringe
or other benefits or remuneration of any kind, but do not include any
governmental plan or program requiring the mandatory payment of social
insurance taxes or similar contributions to a governmental fund with respect
to the wages of any employee.

(b) With respect to each material Company Plan, the Company has provided or
otherwise made available to Parent, to the extent applicable, true, complete
and correct copies of (1) the Company Plan document, including any amendments
thereto, and all related trust documents, insurance contracts or other
funding vehicles, (2) a written summary of such Company Plan if such plan is
not set forth in a written document, (3) the most recently prepared actuarial
report, and (4) all material correspondence to or from any Governmental
Entity received in the last three years with respect to any Company Plan.

(c) (1) Each Company Plan (including any related trusts) that is not a
Non-U.S. Company Plan has been established, operated and administered in all
material respects in compliance with its terms and applicable Laws, including,
without limitation, ERISA and the Code, (2) all material contributions or
other amounts payable by the Company or a Subsidiary with respect to each
Company Plan in respect of current or prior plan years have been accrued in
accordance with GAAP, and (3) there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, material threatened claims (other than routine claims for
benefits) or Proceedings by a Governmental Entity by, on behalf of or against
any Company Plan or any trust related thereto which, in any case, could
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) With respect to each ERISA Plan, the Company has provided or otherwise
made available to Parent, to the extent applicable, true, complete and correct

 



-18-  copies of (1) the most recent summary plan description together with any
summaries of all material modifications thereto, (2) the most recent Internal
Revenue Service determination or opinion letter, and (3) the two most recent
annual reports (Form 5500 or 990 series and all schedules and financial
statements attached thereto).

 

(e) Each ERISA Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing
has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualification or tax exemption of any such Company Plan. With respect to any
ERISA Plan, neither the Company nor a Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction
in connection with which the Company or a Subsidiary reasonably could be
subject to either a material civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409
or 502(i) of ERISA or a material Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976
of the Code.

(f) No Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by the Company or its
ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and to the Knowledge of
the Company, no condition exists that presents a risk to the Company or its
ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability. " _Controlled Group
Liability_ " means any and all liabilities (1) under Title IV of ERISA, (2)
under Section 302 of ERISA, (3) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (4)
as a result of a failure to comply with the continuation coverage
requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and section 4980B of the Code and
(5) in respect of any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37)
of ERISA, any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA or any single employer pension plan within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA for which the Company or any Subsidiary could
incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. 

(g) Each Company Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) is, in all material
respects, in documentary compliance with, and has been operated and
administered in all material respects in compliance with, Section 409A of the
Code and the guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service
provided thereunder.

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder or other
approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement could, either alone or in combination with
another event, (1) entitle any current or former employee, director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any material
increase in severance pay, (2) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
materially increase the amount of compensation due to any such employee,
director or officer, (3) directly or indirectly cause the Company to transfer
or set aside any assets to fund any material benefits under any Company Plan,
(4) otherwise give rise to any material liability under any Company Plan, or
(5) limit or restrict the right to merge, materially amend, terminate or
transfer the assets of any Company Plan on or following the Effective Time.
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder or other
approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement could, either alone or in combination with
another event, result in the payment of any amount that could, individually or
in combination with any other such payment,

 



-19-  constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code; _provided_ _however_ , that any arrangements entered into at the
direction of Parent, or between Parent and its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and a disqualified individual on the other hand (" _Parent Arrangements_ "),
shall not be taken into account so that, as of the date hereof and as of the
Effective Time, compliance with and accuracy of this sentence shall be
determined as if such Parent Arrangements had not been entered into.

 

(i) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to provide, and
no Company Plan or other agreement provides any individual with the right to,
a gross up, indemnification, reimbursement or other payment for any excise or
additional Taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A or
Section 4999 of the Code or due to the failure of any payment to be
deductible under of Section 280G of the Code. The Company has provided or
otherwise made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of any
Section 280G calculations prepared (whether or not final) with respect to any
disqualified individual in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(j) Each Company Equity Award (1) was granted in all material respects in
compliance with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the
Company Stock Plans pursuant to which it was issued, (2) if applicable, has an
exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share of
Shares on the date of such grant, (3) has a grant date no later than the date
on which the Company Board or the Company Compensation Committee intended the
grant to be effective, as applicable, (4) qualifies for the Tax and
accounting treatment afforded to such Company Equity Award, as applicable, in
the Companys Tax Returns and the Company Reports, respectively and (5) does
not trigger any liability for the holder thereof under Section 409A of the
Code.

(k) Except as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, (1) all Non-U.S.
Company Plans (i) have been maintained and operated in accordance with, and
are in compliance with, their terms, applicable local Law, government taxation
and funding requirements, and with any agreement entered into with a union or
labor organization, (ii) to the extent required to be registered or approved
by a foreign Governmental Entity, have been registered with, or approved by, a
foreign Governmental Entity and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred that would adversely affect such registration or approval, and (iii)
to the extent intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, are funded and/or
book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions
and (2) there is no pending or threatened litigation relating to any Non-U.S.
Company Plan. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, with
respect to each Non-U.S. Company Plan, (1) if required to be funded, the
assets of such Non-U.S. Company Plan are sufficient under applicable local Law
to provide for the payment of the relevant benefits in full or (2) if not
required to be funded, the book reserves (determined in accordance with GAAP,
or the International Financial Reporting Standards (" _IFRS_ ") or other
accounting requirements of the local jurisdiction, as applicable) are
sufficient to provide for the payment of the relevant benefits.

4.9 _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. __

its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of
any applicable federal, state, provincial, local or foreign law, statute or
ordinance, common law, or any rule, regulation, standard, Order, arbitration
award, agency requirement, license or permit (including of a prudential
regulatory nature) of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ "),
except for violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except
with respect to regulatory matters covered by Section 6.5, no investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing, except for such investigations or reviews the outcome of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company
has not received any written notice of any material noncompliance with any
such Laws that has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries each has obtained and is in compliance
with all permits, licenses, certifications, approvals, registrations,
consents, authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and Orders issued
or granted by a Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct its
business as currently conducted, except those the absence of which or the
failure to comply with which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section
4.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true, correct and complete
list of each jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
conducting an insurance business for insurance regulatory purposes.

Each such Contract described in clauses (i) through (xvi) of this Section

extensions, renewals, guaranties, modifications, waivers, supplements and
other agreements, if any, related thereto), other than any Material Contracts
that are specifically identified in Section 4.10(a)(xvii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, have been provided or otherwise made available by the
Company to Parent or are filed as exhibits to the Latest Company Report. The
Company has provided to Parent a summary of selected terms of the Material
Contracts specifically identified in Section 4.10(a)(xvii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (each a " _Summarized Material Contract_ "). Each such
summary fairly and correctly summarizes such selected terms of the applicable
Summarized Material Contract in all material respects. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Company

 



-23-  Disclosure Letter, the disclosure related to a Summarized Material Contract
in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall only apply
to the specific section, subsection or matter specifically identified in such
disclosure and only if the summary of such Summarized Material Contract that
has been provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement contained all
relevant terms of such Summarized Material Contract that relate to the
relevant section, subsection or matter for which the Summarized Material
Contract is disclosed.

(b) Each of the Material Contracts constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of the Company or the Subsidiary of the Company party thereto, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto in accordance with its
terms (subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), and is in full force
and effect, except for such failures to be valid and binding or to be in full
force and effect as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. There exists no
breach or event of default with respect to any such Material Contracts on the
part of the Company or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of
time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a breach or default
thereunder by the Company or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other party thereto, or permit termination, modification
or acceleration by any third party thereunder, in each case except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.11 _Real Property; Personal Property_.

 

(a) Except in any such case as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, with
respect to the real property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(the " _Owned Real Property_ "), (i) the Company or one of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, has good and marketable title to the Owned Real Property, free
and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and (ii) there are no
outstanding options or rights of first refusal to purchase the Owned Real
Property, or any portion of the Owned Real Property or interest therein other
than Contracts to acquire or dispose of Investment Assets in the Ordinary
Course of Business.

(b) Section 4.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of all Owned Real Property. Section 4.11(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct street address and such other
information as is reasonably necessary to identify each parcel of Owned Real
Property.

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries has good title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, the
tangible personal assets and properties used or held for use by it in
connection with the conduct of its business as conducted on the date of this
Agreement, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

4.12  _Takeover Statutes_. Except for Section 203 of the DGCL and relevant
Laws of Australia, including the _Corporations Act 2001_ (Cth) (with respect
to Genworth

 



-24-  Australia and its Subsidiaries), and Canada (with respect to Genworth Canada
and its Subsidiaries), no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (each, a "
_Takeover Statute_ "), or any anti-takeover provision in the Fundamental
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is applicable to the
Company, the Shares, any of the Companys Subsidiaries, the capital stock of
any of the Companys Subsidiaries, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 5.13, the Company Board has taken all
actions so that the restrictions on a "business combination" with the Company
(as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) contained in Section 203 of
the DGCL will not apply to the Merger. No "take-over bid" (that is not
otherwise exempt) will be triggered under a Takeover Statute under the Laws of
Canada solely as a result of the Merger.

 

4.13 _Environmental Matters_. (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have
complied at all times in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws since the Applicable Date; (b) no property owned or

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to liability for any
Hazardous Substance disposal or contamination on any third-party property;

good faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any extension of
time within which to file) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by
any of them and all such filed material Tax Returns are complete and accurate
in all material respects, (b) have paid all material Taxes that are required
to be paid or that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are obligated to
withhold from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third party, except
with respect to matters contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings and
for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP,
and (c) have not waived any statute of limitations with respect to material
Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a material Tax
assessment or deficiency and there has been no request by a Governmental
Entity to execute such a waiver or extension. There are no material Tax Liens
upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except
Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable and Liens for Taxes that are
being contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings and for which
adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are not pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened in writing, any audits, examinations, investigations or
other Proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax matters, and no claim has been
made (that has not been resolved) in the past five years by a
Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction where the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not

 



-25-  file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be
subject to material taxation by such jurisdiction. There are not, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any unresolved questions or claims with a
Governmental Entity concerning the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Tax
liability that are not disclosed or provided for in the Company Reports. As of
the date hereof, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is (i) a
party to any Tax allocation, Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or similar agreement
(other than the Restated Tax Matters Agreement, dated February 1, 2006, by and
among the Company, General Electric Company, and certain other parties and
other than pursuant to commercial agreements not primarily relating to Taxes),
(ii) is under an obligation under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) or as transferee or
successor, or (iii) has acquired property in circumstances in which Section
160 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the " _Tax Act_ ") may apply, such that,
in each of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is or may become, after the date hereof or after the Closing
(as the case may be), liable for any amount of Taxes of another Person (other
than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). Except as set forth on Section
4.14 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no closing agreements,
private letter rulings, technical advance memoranda or similar agreements or
rulings that have been entered into or issued by any Tax authority with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which are still in effect
as of the date of this Agreement. Since January 1, 2014, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has been either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a transaction intended to qualify under Section
355 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
"participated" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(c)(3)(i)(A) in any "listed transaction" within the meaning of
Section 6011 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, as in effect
and as amended by any guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service for
the applicable period. The Company has provided or otherwise made available
to Parent true, complete and correct copies of the United States and
Australian federal income Tax Returns and all Canadian federal or provincial
income and sales Tax Returns filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries for
each open Tax year. The Company and its Subsidiaries have made adequate
provision in accordance with GAAP for any material Taxes that are not yet due
and payable for all taxable periods, or portions thereof, ending on or
before the date of this Agreement. At no time during the past five years has
the Company been a United States real property holding corporation within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has systems, processes and procedures in place in order to
materially comply, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, with Sections
1471 through 1474 of the Code and any similar provision of foreign Law.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include
any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction
from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after
the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in method of accounting under
Section 481 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law), or change in the basis for determining any item referred to in Section
807(c) of the Code, for a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on
or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) prepaid amount received on or prior to the
Closing Date outside of the Ordinary Course of Business, or (iv) any election
under Section 108(i) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has a "policyholders surplus account" within the meaning of
Section 815 of the Code which has a positive balance. The Tax treatment of
each Insurance Contract issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
not, and since the time of issuance or subsequent

 



-26-  modification has not been, less favorable to the purchaser, policyholder or
intended beneficiaries thereof, than the Tax treatment either that was
purported to apply in written materials provided by the issuer of such
Insurance Contract, in each case at the time of its issuance (or any
subsequent modification of such Insurance Contract) or for which such
Insurance Contract would reasonably have been expected to qualify at the time
of issuance (or subsequent modification). Each of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries that issues Insurance Contracts maintains systems that are, in
the reasonable judgment of such issuing entity, adequate to maintain material
compliance with applicable qualification provisions of the Code, including
Sections 7702 and 7702A of the Code, and to materially comply with the
withholding and reporting requirements of the Code applicable to the Insurance
Contracts issued by such entity, including Sections 3405 and 6047 of the
Code. The amounts of remaining tax benefit payments owed to General Electric
Company by the Company pursuant to the Restated Tax Matters Agreement, dated
February 1, 2006, by and among the Company, General Electric Company, and
certain other parties, are set forth on Section 4.14 of the Company Disclosure
Letter. No Australian Subsidiary has a tainted share capital account or a
share capital account that is taken to be tainted for the purposes
of Australian Tax law and no Australian Subsidiary has taken any action, up
to and including the date hereof, that would cause their share capital account
to be a tainted share capital account. Each Australian Subsidiary has
maintained proper records of franking debits and franking credits for the
purposes of Australian Tax law and has also provided valid distribution
statements (for Australian Tax law purposes). No Australian Subsidiary has
ever had any permanent establishment (as that expression is defined in the
Tax law and any relevant double taxation agreement current at the date of this
agreement). All material transactions and other dealings between the Company
and its Subsidiaries and other related parties that are subject to transfer
pricing Laws have been (and can be demonstrated to have been) conducted at
arms length, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has complied in all
material respects with all rules relating to transfer pricing under all
applicable Laws with respect thereto, including with respect to the pricing of
goods or services provided to or by the Company or any Subsidiary, and with
respect to the preparation of documents or records required under applicable
transfer pricing Laws. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into or been a party to any
transaction which contravenes any anti-avoidance provisions of any Tax Law
that would result in a material amount of Taxes on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. No event has occurred (including the execution of this Agreement
or the Companys or its Subsidiaries performance hereunder), as a result of
which, any Tax from which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have
obtained an exemption or other relief will become payable, except for those
Taxes that would not be material to the Company of its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. There are no circumstances existing which could result in
the application to Genworth Canada or any of its Subsidiaries of sections 17,
78, 80.01, 80.02, 80.03, 80.04 of the Tax Act or any analogous provision of
any comparable Law of any province or territory of Canada.

 

4.15 _Labor Matters_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other agreement with a labor union or like
organization, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no activities or
proceedings by any individual or group of individuals, including
representatives of any labor organizations or labor unions, to organize any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



-27- (b) There is no (1) strike, lockout, slowdown, work stoppage, job
action, picketing, unfair labor practice or other labor dispute pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (2) unfair labor practice charge against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pending before the National Labor Relations Board or any
comparable labor relations authority, and (3) pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened arbitration or grievance, charge, complaint, audit or
investigation by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, which could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all respects
with all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment
practices (including equal employment opportunity Laws), terms and conditions
of employment, workers compensation, occupational safety and health,
affirmative action, employee privacy, plant closings, and wages and hours,
except where failure to comply therewith could not reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) There are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any
forum by or on behalf of any present or former employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, any applicant for employment or classes of the foregoing
alleging breach of any express or implied employment Contract, violation of
any Law governing employment or the termination thereof, or any other
discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct on the part of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the employment relationship which
could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is delinquent in any
payments to any of their respective employees for any wages, salaries,
commissions, bonuses or other direct compensation for any services performed
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except where such delinquency
could not reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material
liability or obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder or any similar
state or local Law that remains unsatisfied.

 

(g) To the Knowledge of the Company, no individual who has performed services
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been improperly excluded from
participation in any Company Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material liability with respect to any misclassification
of any Person as an independent contractor rather than as an employee, with
respect to any misclassification of any employee as exempt versus non-exempt,
or with respect to any employee leased from another employer, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any notice of nor, to the Knowledge of
the Company, is there any pending or threatened material claim by any Person

 



-28-  who is performing or has performed services for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that he/she is or was misclassified for any purpose.

its Subsidiaries alleging that the conduct of the businesses of the Company or

written, valid and enforceable assignments in favor of the Company or such
Subsidiary of all such Intellectual Property and Software.

Assets during the past two years in a manner that has resulted or could
reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain
commercially reasonable security, backup and disaster recovery technology
and processes consistent with industry practices.

(h) The Company and its Subsidiaries have: (i) complied in all
material respects with all contractual obligations relating to the

amounts and against such risks as the Company reasonably has determined to be
prudent. Each Insurance Policy is in full force and effect and all premiums

4.19 _Insurance Reports_.

 

(a) A true and complete list as of the date hereof of all the Subsidiaries
through which the Company conducts its insurance and reinsurance operations
(collectively, the " _Insurance Subsidiaries_ "), together with the
jurisdiction of domicile thereof, is set forth in Section 4.19(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Since the Applicable Date, each of the Insurance
Subsidiaries has timely filed all annual and quarterly statements, including
amendments thereto, together with all exhibits, interrogatories, notes,
schedules and any actuarial opinions, affirmations or certifications or
other supporting documents in connection therewith, required to be filed with
the appropriate Insurance Regulators of the jurisdiction in which it is
domiciled or commercially domiciled on forms prescribed or permitted by such
Insurance Regulators (collectively, the " _Company Statements_ "). The
Company has provided or otherwise made available to Parent true and complete
copies of all Company Statements filed with any Insurance Regulator since the
Applicable Date. Without limiting the foregoing, since the Applicable Date,
all Contracts and transactions in effect between any Insurance Subsidiary and
any Affiliate that are required to be filed with, and/or approved by, an
Insurance Regulator under the applicable insurance holding company statutes
or other applicable Insurance Laws, have been filed with such applicable
Insurance Regulator, and the applicable Insurance Subsidiary has obtained any
required approvals or deemed approvals of Insurance Regulators with respect

will be) prepared in conformity in all material respects with SAP,
consistently applied for the periods covered thereby, and fairly present in
all material respects the statutory financial position of the relevant
Insurance Subsidiary as of the respective dates thereof and the results of
operations and cash flows of such Insurance Subsidiary for the respective
periods then ended subject, in the case of the Company SAP Statements with
respect to interim periods, to the absence of full footnote disclosure and
normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or
effect. No material deficiency has been asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to any Company SAP Statements that has not been resolved, to the
Companys Knowledge, to the material satisfaction of the Governmental Entity
prior to the date hereof. As of their respective filing dates, the Company
SAP Statements complied with, to the extent in effect at the time of filing or
submission, the applicable requirements of all Laws, rules and regulations
applicable to the business of insurance or the regulation of insurance
holding companies, whether domestic or foreign, and all applicable Orders of
Governmental Entities and Insurance Regulators (collectively, the " _Insurance
Laws_ "), except for such failures to comply as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

the Insurance Subsidiaries in connection with the Company SAP Statements that

Practices and Procedures Manual or similar non-U.S. accounting methodologies
applicable to any of the Insurance Subsidiaries (each such departure, a "
_Permitted Accounting Practice_ "). All Permitted Accounting Practices have
been approved by the applicable Insurance Regulators in writing at or prior
to the time used by the Insurance Subsidiaries in connection with the
applicable Company SAP Statements.

 

(d) The Company has provided or otherwise made available to Parent true,
complete and correct copies of the Actuarial Reports. To the Knowledge of the
Company, the information and data furnished by any Insurance Subsidiary in
connection with the preparation of the Actuarial Reports were derived from the
relevant books and records of the Company and accurate in all
material respects as of the date so furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company and its Affiliates do not guarantee the projected results included
in the Actuarial Reports and make no representation or warranty with respect
to the Actuarial Reports, any estimates, projections, predications,
forecasts, assumptions, methodologies and judgments in the Actuarial Reports
or the assumptions on the basis of which such information was, or data were,
prepared (including, without limitation, as to future morbidity or mortality,
policyholder behavior, expense, investment experience and other actuarial
factors with respect to the Company or its associated liabilities or assets),
or to the effect that the projected profits set forth in the Actuarial
Reports will be realized. As of the date hereof, neither Milliman nor PWC has
issued to the Company or its Affiliates any new or revised report with respect
to the Insurance Subsidiaries, or any supplements, addenda or errata
with respect to their respective Actuarial Reports, nor have they notified
the Company that the relevant Actuarial Report is inaccurate in any material
respect.

 

(e) The aggregate insurance policy reserves for claims, losses (including
incurred but not reported losses), loss adjustment expenses (whether
allocated or unallocated), and unearned premium for each Insurance Subsidiary,
as reflected in its Company SAP Statements, (i) were determined in accordance
with SAP applied on a consistent basis for the periods presented, (ii) were

financial statements), (iii) were fairly stated in all material respects in
accordance with sound actuarial principles, (iv) were derived from the books
and records of such Insurance Subsidiary, (v) include provisions for
liabilities meeting or exceeding those required by the express terms of the
Insurance Contracts and (vi) satisfied the requirements of applicable
Insurance Laws in all material respects. Neither this Section 4.19(e) nor
anything else in this Agreement shall constitute a representation or warranty
to the effect that such reserves will be sufficient or adequate for the
purposes for which they were established.

 

(f) The Company has provided or otherwise made available to Parent (i) true,
complete and correct copies of all material submissions by the Company or any
of its Insurance Subsidiaries domiciled in the United States, Australia or
Canada to any Insurance Regulator in the United States, Australia and Canada,
as applicable, relating to the risk-based 

 



-32-  capital of such Insurance Subsidiary together with true, accurate and
complete copies of all substantive responses from the relevant Insurance
Regulators to such submissions, and (ii) all material annual registration
statements and periodic reports with respect to the Company or any Insurance
Subsidiary domiciled in the United States, Australia or Canada provided to any
Insurance Regulator in the United States, Australia and Canada, as

case, during the 24 months immediately preceding the date of this Agreement.

 

4.20 _Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) All Insurance Contracts are, to the extent required under applicable
Insurance Laws, on forms and at premium rates approved by the applicable
Insurance Regulator or, to the extent required by applicable Laws, have been

insurance producer, or to induce the public to purchase, increase, modify,

and-desist or other Order issued by, or is a party to a Regulatory Agreement
with, or is subject to any Order by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary
supervisory letter from, or has adopted any policy, procedure or board
resolutions at the request of, any Governmental Entity, that
materially restricts the conduct of its business or gives rise to any capital
maintenance obligations, nor, since the Applicable Date, has the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries been advised in writing by any Governmental Entity
that it is considering issuing or requesting any of the foregoing.

(d) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable Laws, the Company has
provided or otherwise made available to Parent true, complete and correct
copies of (A) any material reports on financial examination (including draft
reports where final reports are not yet available) and (B) any material

-33-  reports where final reports are not yet available), in each case, delivered

applicable Laws, to act as an Agent for an Insurance Subsidiary and was duly
and appropriately licensed as an Agent (for the type of business sold or
produced by such Agent on behalf of an Insurance Subsidiary), in each
jurisdiction in which such Agent was required to be so licensed except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not, individually or in

Effect, since the Applicable Date, to the Knowledge of the Company: (i) no
Agent violated any term or provision of applicable Laws relating to the sale
or production of any Insurance Contract; (ii) no Agent has breached the terms
of any agency or broker Contract with an Insurance Subsidiary or violated any
Law or policy of an Insurance Subsidiary in the solicitation, negotiation,
writing, sale or production of business for any Insurance Subsidiary; and
(iii) no Agent has been enjoined, indicted, convicted or made the subject of
any consent decree or judgment on account of any violation of applicable Laws
in connection with such Agents actions in his, her or its capacity as an
Agent for an Insurance Subsidiary or any enforcement or disciplinary
Proceeding alleging any such violation.

 

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, since the Applicable
Date, each Agent was appointed and compensated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in compliance in all respects with applicable Insurance Law.

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of any
voluntary (or to the Knowledge of the Company, involuntary) supervision,
conservation, rehabilitation, liquidation, receivership, insolvency or other
similar Proceeding, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has any Governmental
Entity threatened in writing to make the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
the subject of any such Proceeding.

(h) The Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, (i) have established,
and are in compliance in all material respects with, written privacy policies
applicable to the collection, use, disclosure, maintenance and transmission of
Personally Identifiable Information of individual policyholders,
customers, consumers or benefits recipients and (ii) since the Applicable
Date, have required by written Contract all third-party service providers and
other third parties who have or have had access to such Personally
Identifiable Information, or who process such Personally Identifiable
Information on their behalf, to have in written form, and to implement,
similar security programs and policies. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
and maintain a privacy and security monitoring compliance program to

 



-34-  periodically evaluate and access the sufficiency of the security programs
and policies. Since the Applicable Date, neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any third-party service
provider working on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has had a
material breach, security incident or unauthorized access, disclosure, use or
loss of Personally Identifiable Information for which it was required to
notify individuals and/or to notify any Governmental Entity or to take any
other action as required by applicable Laws governing Personally Identifiable
Information security.

 

(i) Since the Applicable Date, each Insurance Subsidiary has timely paid in
all material respects all guaranty fund assessments that have been due,
claimed or asserted by, or are the subject of any voluntary contribution
commitment to, any state insurance guaranty association, risk sharing plan,
joint underwriting association, residual market facility, assigned risk pool
or similar arrangement, or any Governmental Entity charged with the
supervision of insurance companies in any jurisdiction in which such Insurance
Subsidiary does business.

 

(j) No Insurance Subsidiary is "commercially domiciled" under the Laws of any
jurisdiction.

 

(k) Except for Policies identified in Section 4.20(k) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, no provision in any Insurance Contract gives the holder
thereof or any other Person the right to receive policy dividends or otherwise
participate in the revenue, earnings or profits of the Company.

 

4.21 _Reinsurance_.

 

(a) Section 4.21(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Reinsurance
Contract that is in-force as of the date hereof. The Company has provided or
otherwise made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of such
Reinsurance Contracts (together with all amendments, extensions, renewals,
guaranties, modifications, waivers, supplements and other agreements, if any,

Subsidiary cedes risk to a reinsurer, other than any Reserve Financing
Contract, any reinsurance agreement relating to risks arising out of the
Companys mortgage insurance business (which is the subject of clause (iii)

(b) Each of the Reinsurance Contracts constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto, enforceable against the
Company and, to the Knowledge

 



-35-  of the Company, each other party thereto in accordance with its terms
(subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), and is in full force and
effect, except for such failures to be valid and binding as are not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 4.21(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, as of the date hereof, the Company has not
received written notice of early termination of any such Reinsurance
Contract. There exists no material breach or event of default with respect to
any Reinsurance Contract on the part of the Company or its Subsidiaries or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, and no event has
occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute a material breach or default thereunder by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto.
Except as set forth in Section 4.21(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the

by this Agreement to which it is a party will not violate, or result in a
right to terminate, recapture, rescind or modify, any Reinsurance Contract or
any coverage provided by any party thereto.

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.21(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there is no dispute pending with respect to any material amounts recoverable
or payable by the Company pursuant to any Ceded Reinsurance Contract. As of
the date hereof, none of the Insurance Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any reinsurer under any Reinsurance Contract is insolvent, or
the subject of a rehabilitation, liquidation, conservatorship, receivership,
bankruptcy or similar Proceeding and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
financial condition of any such reinsurer is not impaired to the extent that
a default thereunder is reasonably anticipated.

(d) Each Insurance Subsidiary was entitled to take the credit that was
taken by it in its Company SAP Statements pursuant to applicable Laws for all
reinsurance and coinsurance ceded pursuant to any Reinsurance Contract to
which such Insurance Subsidiary was a party as of the date of the applicable
Company SAP Statement. With respect to any Reinsurance Contract for which any
Insurance Subsidiary is taking credit on its most recent Company SAP
Statements or has taken credit on any of its Company SAP Statements from and
after January 1, 2015, (i) there have been no separate written or oral
agreements between such Insurance Subsidiary and the assuming reinsurer that
would under any circumstances reduce, limit, mitigate or otherwise affect any
actual or potential loss to the parties under any such Reinsurance Contract,
other than inuring to reinsurance contracts that are specifically defined in
any such Reinsurance Contract, (ii) each Insurance Subsidiary complies and has
complied from and after January 1, 2015 in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of SAP related to the credit taken and (iii) each

Companys Subsidiaries between such date and the Closing Date, the "

Investment Assets it purports to own, free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Liens.

 

(c) Except as set forth on Section 4.22(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
(i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material funding
obligations of any kind, or material obligation to make any additional

any obligation relating to any currency or interest rate swap, hedge or
similar arrangement that was not entered into in the Ordinary Course of
Business or not in accordance with the Company Hedging Policies in all
material respects) and (ii) there are no material outstanding commitments,
options, put agreements or other similar arrangements relating to the

(a) The Contracts listed in Section 4.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
" _Reserve Financing Contracts_ ") constitute all of the material Contracts
comprising the excess reserve financing arrangements to which the Companys
Insurance Subsidiaries, including any of the Companys captive insurance
company subsidiaries, are parties. The Company has provided or otherwise made
available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of such Reserve
Financing Contracts (together with all amendments, extensions, renewals,
guaranties, modifications, waivers, supplements and other agreements, if any,
related thereto). Each of the Reserve Financing Contracts constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company party
thereto and, to the 

 



-37-  Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto, enforceable against the
Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto in
accordance with its terms (subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception),
and is in full force and effect. There exists no material breach or event of
default with respect to any Reserve Financing Contract on the part of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other
party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the
giving of notice or both would constitute a material breach or default
thereunder by the Company or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the

counterparty under any such Reserve Financing Contract is insolvent or the
subject of a rehabilitation, liquidation, conservatorship, receivership,

counterparty is not impaired to the extent that a default thereunder is
reasonably anticipated. No written notice of intended cancellation or
termination has been received by the Company or by any of its Subsidiaries
from any counterparty to the Reserve Financing Contracts, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received or delivered any notice of
dispute under any such Reserve Financing Contract, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company and the Companys applicable Subsidiaries have received all
material clearances, consents, approvals, Orders, waivers, Licenses or
authorizations of or from, and have made all material declarations and filings
with, all Governmental Entities required to be obtained or made by the
Company and such Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Reserve Financing Contracts and all such
clearances, consents, approvals, Orders, waivers, Licenses and authorizations
are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn, revoked or
rescinded. With respect to any Reserve Financing Contracts for which any of
the Companys Insurance Subsidiaries has taken credit on a balance sheet
included within the Company SAP Statements, such taking of credit was in
compliance with the applicable Laws of the Companys Insurance Subsidiarys
domiciliary state. No Reserve Financing Contract contains any provision
providing that any party thereto (other than the Company or the Companys
Subsidiary) may terminate, cancel or commute such Reserve Financing Contract
by reason of the consummation of the Merger.

default or breach and each Mortgage Insurance Subsidiary is entitled to all of
its rights and benefits thereunder, in each case, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set out in Section 4.24(b)(ii) of the

on loans acquired by the GSEs. Each Mortgage Insurance Subsidiary domiciled in
Canada is an approved mortgage insurer in good standing under the National

fund any operations in, finance any investments or activities in or make any
payments to, a Sanctioned Person or a Sanctioned Country in violation of the

terms and conditions thereof, equity securities of Parent, up to the aggregate
amount set forth in its Equity Commitment Letter (the " _Equity Financing_
"). The proceeds of the Equity Financing shall be used for the purpose of
enabling Parent to fund (i) the payments under Section 3.1(a) when due under
this Agreement, (ii) Parents commitment contemplated in Section 6.16(a)
hereof on or prior to the maturity of the Company 2018 Notes and (iii)
Parents commitment contemplated in Section 6.16(b) hereof in connection with
the consummation of the U.S. Life Restructuring

 

(b) As of the date hereof, (i) the Equity Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and the
Investors and (ii) the Equity Commitment Letter has not been amended or
modified, and no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and the
commitment contained in the Equity Commitment Letter has not been
withdrawn or rescinded. Assuming (A) the Equity Financing is funded in
accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter and (B) the satisfaction of the
conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
as set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 or the waiver of such conditions,
the net proceeds of the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment
Letter will be sufficient (i) for Parent and the Surviving Corporation to pay
the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) at
the Effective Time and (ii) for Parent to (x) make the capital contribution
contemplated under Section 6.16(a) hereof on or prior to the maturity of the
Company 2018 Notes and (y) make the capital contribution contemplated in
Section 6.16(b) hereof in connection with the consummation of the U.S. Life
Restructuring. The Equity Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Equity
Financing available to Parent on the terms and conditions contained therein.
As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements,
Contracts or arrangements (whether written or oral) to which Parent or any of
its Affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable,
of the full amount of the Equity Financing other than as

 



-45-  expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof,
no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach under the Equity Commitment Letter on
the part of any of the parties thereto.

5.8 _Capitalization and Operations of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital
stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 5,000 shares of common stock, par value
$0.00001 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of

the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging
in the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has not
conducted any business activities other than those incidental to its
formation and pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
has no, and immediately prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets,
liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its
formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.9 _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. Since the Applicable Date, the
businesses of Parent and its Affiliates have not been, and are not being,
conducted in violation of any Laws, except for violations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Except with respect to regulatory matters covered
by Section 6.5, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with
respect to Parent or any of its Affiliates is pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened in writing, except for such investigations or reviews the
outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

5.10 _Solvency_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is, and, after giving effect
to the Closing, will be, Solvent, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is
entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent
to hinder, delay or defraud any Person.

the fees and expenses of any broker, investment banker, financial adviser or
other Person acting in a similar capacity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing.

 

5.12 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
Parent, Merger Sub or any Representative or Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub
in writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, on the date of filing
with the SEC, at the time first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and
at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied or to be supplied by any other Person that is included in
the Proxy Statement.

 

5.13 _Section_ _ _ _203 of the DGCL_. None of Parent General Holding Company,
Public Parent, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective "affiliates" or
"associates" is, or at any time during the past three years has been, an
"interested stockholder" of the Company (all such terms being used as defined
in Section 203 of the DGCL).

 



-46- 5.14 _OFAC_. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (i) is a Sanctioned
Person, (ii) has more than 15% of its assets in Sanctioned Countries, or
(iii) derives more than 15% of its operating income from investments in, or
transactions with, Sanctioned Persons or Sanctioned Countries which, in each
case, would result in a violation of the OFAC sanctions programs by such
company. To the Knowledge of the Parent, no funds of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries have been used directly or indirectly to fund any operations in,
finance any investments or activities in or make any payments to, a
Sanctioned Person or a Sanctioned Country in violation of the OFAC sanctions
programs, or for any payments to any governmental official or employee,
official of a political party, candidate for political office, or anyone else
acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of the government or
political party, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any
improper advantage, in violation in any material respect of the United States
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.

contained herein, the Parent Disclosure Letter, or any of the Schedules or
Exhibits hereto or thereto, the Company acknowledges and agrees that neither
Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates, nor any Representative of
any of them, makes or has made any representation or warranty, oral or
written, express or implied, other than as expressly made by them in this
Article V, and that the Company has not relied on any such other
representation or warranty.

_Third Party_ "), or

 



-54-  (ii) any proposal or offer by any Third Party for an acquisition, in each
case of the foregoing (i) and (ii), which, if consummated, would result in
such Person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, in one or
a series of related transactions (including by way of reinsurance or
otherwise), of (x) 10% or more of the total voting power of any class of
equity securities of the Company (or of the surviving entity in a merger

assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) of the

counsel and taking into account legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects
of the proposal and of this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement) as the Company Board considers to be
appropriate, (x) would result in a transaction that, if consummated, would be

prior to the earlier of (x) the date of the Stockholders Meeting (if it is
reasonably practicable to make such recommendation prior to the Stockholders
Meeting, taking into account the amount of time between the disclosure of
such offer and the Stockholders Meeting and the Companys ability to adjourn
the Stockholders Meeting to facilitate such recommendation) and (y) 11
Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, or (E) fail to reaffirm the
Company Recommendation within two Business Days after receiving a written
request to do so from Parent or approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable (or 

 



-55-  publicly propose to approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal (any of
the foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
no action or omission of the board of directors (or other governing bodies)
of the Specified Entities shall constitute a Change of Recommendation
hereunder.

 

(ii) Subject to the termination right contemplated by Section 8.3(b), the
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and the Company
Board and each committee of the Company Board shall not approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or other agreement (except for confidentiality agreements permitted under
Section 6.2(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(d) _Change of Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company Board may, prior to but not after the
time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, make a Change of Recommendation
if (i) an Intervening Event has occurred or (ii) the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and the Company Board has determined in good
faith after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that, the Company Board may not take
any such action unless (1) in the case of clause (ii) above, the receipt of
such Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a material breach of this
Section 6.2, (2) prior to making such Change of Recommendation, the Company
provides prior written notice to Parent at least five Business Days in advance
(the " _Change of Recommendation Notice Period_ ") of its intention to take
such action, which notice shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal, specify
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal) and attach the most
current unredacted version of any documents evidencing such Superior Proposal,
and any material modifications to any of the foregoing, and, in the case of an
Intervening Event, include a reasonably detailed description of such
Intervening Event, (3) during the Change of Recommendation Notice Period the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisor and outside counsel to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith should Parent propose to make such
amendments of the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that, in the
case of a Superior Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a
Superior Proposal and, in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure to
make such Change of Recommendation in light of such Intervening Event would
no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under
applicable Laws (in each case as determined in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board after taking into account any such amendments that Parent shall
have agreed to make prior to the end of the Change of Recommendation Notice
Period) and (4) the Company Board takes into account any amendments of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed to by Parent in writing prior
to the end of the Change of Recommendation Notice Period; _it_ _being_
_understood_ that any material amendment of any Acquisition Proposal will be
deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal, including for purposes of the Change
of Recommendation Notice Period; _provided_ , _however_ , subsequent to the
initial Change of Recommendation Notice Period, the Change of Recommendation
Notice Period shall be 

 



-56-  reduced to three Business Days and, following such reduction any additional
Change of Recommendation Notice Periods shall be further reduced to one
Business Day.

 

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Specified Entities or the Company
Board or the board of directors (or other governing bodies) of any Specified
Entity from: (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal
or state law or, in the case of a Specified Entity, its disclosure
obligations under the Laws of Australia or Canada (as applicable), with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company or any Specified Entity, as applicable, if, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, the Company or such Specified Entity, as
applicable, determines that such disclosure would be required under applicable
Laws; or (iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions
contained in this Section 6.2; _provided_ , _however_ , in the case of (i)
and (ii), if such disclosure has the substantive effect of withdrawing or
modifying in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Recommendation, such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(a). The
parties agree that any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys
stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act will not
constitute a Change of Recommendation hereunder.

(f) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, solicitations, discussions
or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that it will
promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries respective securities or assets, to return or destroy
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries including promptly terminating all
physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such
Persons.

(g)  _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 48 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (and any changes thereto) are received by,
any information or data in connection with an Acquisition Proposal is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiation in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any
of its Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name
of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements). Thereafter the Company will keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any
such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of
any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the
Companys intentions as previously notified.

 



-57- 6.3 _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within 30
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form. The Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments
of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC
for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and
shall (i) as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent
and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and advise Parent and its
counsel of any oral comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) received from the SEC or its staff, (ii)
provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the
Companys proposed response to such comments, (iii) consider in good faith any
comments proposed by Parent and its counsel and (iv) provide Parent and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions or
meetings with the SEC (or portions of any such meetings that relate to the
Proxy Statement). The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments
received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as practicable after the
date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that
the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to
the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 

(c) Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.2(d), the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Recommendation.

6.4 _Stockholders Meeting_.

 

Regardless of whether the Company Board determines at any time that this
Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the Companys
stockholders reject it or whether any other Change of Recommendation has
occurred at any time, in accordance with Section 6.2, but subject to the
Companys rights under Sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3, the Company shall (a)
establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold, a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), for
the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and (b) use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Stockholders Meeting to occur within 30

 



-58-  days immediately following the date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed
to the Companys stockholders (unless otherwise consented to in writing by
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
and if such calendar day is not a Business Day, on the first Business Day
subsequent to such calendar day); _provided_ that, (i) the Company may
postpone or adjourn such meeting to the extent that it has reasonably
determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that such
postponement or adjournment is necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Stockholders Meeting; (ii) if as of the time for which the Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient Shares present (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting or
insufficient votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement to obtain the
Requisite Company Vote, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Stockholders
Meeting to a date that is a Business Day and no more than 30 days after the
previous meeting date, as reasonably determined by the Company; and the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts during such period
to obtain such a quorum as promptly as practicable; and (iii) the Company may
adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting until the fourth Business Day
after the expiration of any Change of Recommendation Notice Period; _provided_
,  _further_ , that, in the event that during the five Business Days prior to
the date that the Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to be held, the
Company delivers a notice of an intent to make a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with Section 6.2(d), Parent may direct the Company to adjourn or
postpone the Stockholders Meeting for up to 10 Business Days and the Company
will promptly, and in any event no later than the next Business Day, adjourn
or postpone the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Parents direction.
Once the Company has established a record date for the Stockholders Meeting,
the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record
date for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Unless
the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Recommendation in accordance
with Section 6.2, the Company Board shall make the Company Recommendation and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite
Company Vote. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of
this Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will be the only matters (other than related procedural matters)
that the Company will propose to be acted on by the Companys stockholders at
the Stockholders Meeting.

 

6.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) Cooperation.

 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the third proviso in the definition
of "Subsidiaries"), the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and
use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and other Affiliates to
use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on their respective parts under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, the Merger and the other

of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company, as applicable, shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
and other Affiliates to), in consultation and cooperation with the other and

of the United States Department of Justice the notification and report form

each request early termination of the waiting period with respect to the
Merger under the HSR Act), (B) all appropriate documents, forms, filings or
submissions required under any applicable foreign competition, antitrust,
merger control, insurance or investment or other Laws, including

notification of the transactions contemplated hereby to CFIUS (" _Joint
Notice_ ") pursuant to Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as
amended, including amendments made by the Foreign Investment and National
Security Act of 2007 (codified at 50 U.S.C. § 4565), and the regulations
promulgated by CFIUS thereunder, codified at 31 C.F.R. Part 800, et seq.
(collectively, " _Section_ _ _ _721_ "), (E) with FINRA, all appropriate
documents, forms, filings or submissions required under NASD Rule 1017 and (F)
all required approval applications to and notification filings with the
National Development and Reform Commission of the PRC, Ministry of Commerce of
the PRC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC, or their
respective local counterparts, as applicable (each, a " _PRC
Governmental Entity_ "). The parties acknowledge and agree that the filings
and notifications identified on the "Regulatory Filings: Timing and
Responsibility" checklists included in Section 6.5(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter and Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be made by
the parties, and within the periods, specified therein. Parent and the Company
shall each use its respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective the U.S. Life Restructuring, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, including preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable all

 



-60-  documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain, as promptly as practicable, and maintain all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable
to be obtained from any third party or any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the U.S. Life Restructuring. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
may include references to the U.S. Life Restructuring in the
Approval Applications and similar filings required in connection with the
acquisition of control of the Insurance Subsidiaries.

 

(ii) Each of Parent and the Company, as applicable, shall promptly notify the
other of the receipt by it, any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates of
all comments of applicable Governmental Entities with respect to the filings,
notifications and other submissions referred to in Section 6.5(a)(i),
including any request by a Governmental Entity for an amendment or supplement
to such filings, notifications and other submissions or for additional
information. As promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, each of Parent
and the Company, as applicable, will provide the other and its counsel
with copies of any such comments that are in writing, and advise the other
and its counsel of the substance of any such comments that are oral. Each of
the Company and Parent (for itself and its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates,
as applicable) shall use its reasonable best efforts promptly to (i) provide
responses to such Governmental Entities with respect to all such comments
received and (ii) resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to such filings, notifications and
submissions, as well as to the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall have
the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with, any filing made with, or written materials submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that, (i) the parties
do not have to provide each other any Personally Identifiable Information
contained in any such filing or written materials, and such filing or
materials may be redacted to remove Personally Identifiable Information, and
(ii) Parent does not have to provide to the Company copies of any Biographical
Affidavits if it makes copies of such Biographical Affidavits available for
review by the Companys counsel prior to their submission; and _provided_ ,
_further_ that, with respect to the FINRA application referenced in Section
6.5(a)(i)(E) or any supplemental requests made by FINRA or any other
Governmental Entity with respect thereto, the parties acknowledge that Parent
may initially attempt to submit unilaterally to FINRA any Personally
Identifiable Information or other biographical information relating to the
officers, directors, employees or Potential Controllers of, or other relevant
individuals affiliated with, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates,
that may be required to complete such FINRA application but that, if Parent is
unable successfully to deliver such information to FINRA in a manner that
satisfies FINRA and such information is instead required to be submitted by
the Company, then Parent shall provide the Company with such information, and,
in that case, the Company shall restrict access to such information to the
employees who need to receive it in order to make the applicable filing. In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. In addition, subject to the
foregoing rights, each of Parent and the Company will provide the
other copies of all filings and other written materials provided to any
Governmental

 



-61-  Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement promptly after their filing or submission. Each of Parent
(for itself, its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates) and the Company will not
independently participate in any substantive meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
using reasonable best efforts to give the other party reasonable prior written
notice of such meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by any such
Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend or participate in such
meeting or conversation either in person or by telephone. If any Governmental
Entity requires that a hearing or meeting be held in connection with any
requisite approval, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
for such hearing or meeting to be held as promptly as practicable after the
notice that such hearing or meeting is required has been received by Parent,
its Subsidiaries or any other Affiliates. The Company and Parent will not
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with
any Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other party.

 

(iii) In furtherance of, and without limiting the generality of, the
obligations in Section 6.5(a)(i) and Section 6.5(a)(ii), each of the Company
and Parent agrees to take or cause to be taken the following actions in
connection with the efforts to obtain the Completion of CFIUS Process: (A)
cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with the
Joint Notice, including by allowing the other party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions; (B) promptly inform the other party of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, CFIUS,
by promptly providing copies to the other party of any such written
communications, except for any exhibits to such communications providing the
Personally Identifiable Information required by 31 C.F.R. §
800.402(c)(6)(vi); and (C) permit the other party to review in advance any
communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with CFIUS, and to the
extent not prohibited by CFIUS, give the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in any in-person meetings with CFIUS, in each of clauses (A),
(B) and (C), subject to confidentiality considerations contemplated
by Section 721 or as may be required by CFIUS. In addition, with regard to
any meeting or substantive conversation, a party may not be represented or
notified by the other party if any relevant Governmental Entity objects to the
partys being represented at any such meeting or in any such conversation and
if a communication or meeting relates to a national security risk mitigation
agreement between Parent and CFIUS or any of its constituent agencies, then
Parent will be excused from any of its obligations to Company in this clause
(iii) with respect thereto.

(b) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement:

(i) In no event shall (A) any party or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates be required to agree to any material term, condition, obligation,
restriction, requirement, limitation, qualification, remedy or other action
imposed, required or requested by a 

 



-62-  Governmental Entity in connection with its grant of any Company Approval or
Parent Approval that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or
(B) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates agree to any
term, condition, obligation, restriction, requirement, limitation,
qualification, remedy or other action in connection with the obtaining of any
Company Approval or Parent Approval without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

(ii) The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that neither this Section 6.5
nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall require, or be construed to
require, Parent or any of its Affiliates, in order to obtain any Company
Approvals or Parent Approvals, to agree to any term or condition or take any
action:

(A) that would (1) impose any requirement to sell, license, assign, transfer,
divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, before or after the Closing,
any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, (2) prohibit, limit, restrain or impair Parents, the Companys
or any of their respective Affiliates ability to control, direct, manage or
operate, or exercise full rights of ownership with respect to, their
respective assets, licenses, product lines, businesses or interests
therein (including, with respect to Parent, its ownership of interests in the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing), (3) impair the ability of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to continue to conduct their
respective businesses following the Closing substantially in the manner
conducted in the 12-month period prior to the date hereof or (4) impose any
other obligation, restriction, requirement, limitation, qualification,
condition, remedy or other action, that in the case of all such terms and
conditions described in clauses (1) through (4), individually or in the
aggregate with all other such terms or conditions would, (x) reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition;
properties, assets and liabilities (considered together), business; or results
of operation of Parent and its Affiliates, taken as a whole, or a Company
Material Adverse Effect (in each case, either before or after giving
effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), or (y) reasonably be expected to materially impair the aggregate
economic benefits that, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent and its
Affiliates reasonably expect to derive from the consummation of the Merger
and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, other
than any action or condition relating to Capital Support, which shall be
governed by clause (B) below; or

 

(B) set forth in Section 6.5(b)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter;

 

(any such terms and conditions described in clause (A) or (B) above, in each
case, being referred to herein as a " _Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided_
that, Parent can compel the Company to take any of the actions referred to
above in this Section 6.5(b)(ii) (or agree to take such actions) if such
actions are conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
matters set forth on Section 6.5(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
constitute a Burdensome Condition or be taken into account in determining
whether a Burdensome Condition exists or has been imposed.

 



-63- (iii) The parties further acknowledge that neither this Section 6.5 nor
the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall require, or be construed to
require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to prepare or submit any Specified
Information to any Governmental Entity in order to obtain any Company
Approvals or Parent Approvals.

(iv) In the event that CFIUS notifies Parent, Merger Sub and the Company that
CFIUS (x) has completed its review or investigation and (y) intends to send a
report to the President of the United States recommending that the President
act to suspend or prohibit the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent may request a withdrawal of the Joint
Notice and neither Parent, nor Merger Sub nor the Company shall have any
further obligation to seek Completion of CFIUS Process.

 

(c) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or
on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that, notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary, (i) the parties do not have to provide each other any
Personally Identifiable Information required under any such statement, filing,
notice or application, and such statement, filing, notice or application may
be redacted to remove Personally Identifiable Information, and (ii) Parent
does not have to provide the Company copies of any Biographical Affidavits if
it makes copies of such Biographical Affidavits available for review by the
Companys counsel prior to their submission; and _provided_ , _further_ that,
with respect to the FINRA application referenced in Section 6.5(a)(i)(E) or
any supplemental requests made by FINRA or any other Governmental Entity with
respect thereto, the parties acknowledge that Parent may initially attempt to
submit unilaterally to FINRA any Personally Identifiable Information or other
biographical information relating to the officers, directors, employees or
Potential Controllers of, or other relevant individuals affiliated with,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, that may be required to
complete such FINRA application but that, if Parent is unable successfully to
deliver such information to FINRA in a manner that satisfies FINRA and
such information is instead required to be submitted by the Company, then
Parent shall provide the Company with such information, and, in that case, the
Company shall restrict access to such information to the employees who need to
receive it in order to make the applicable filing.

(d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each shall
keep the other apprised on a prompt basis of the status of matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party shall give to the other party prompt
written notice if it receives, and Parent shall give the Company prompt
written notice if any of its Affiliates or other Potential Controller
receives, any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, in the case of any such notice or communication that is in
writing, shall promptly furnish such other party with a copy thereof;
_provided_ that, the parties do not have to provide each other any Personally
Identifiable Information contained in such communications, and such

 



-64-  communications may be redacted to remove Personally Identifiable Information
and Parent does not have to furnish copies of written communications with
respect to the Biographical Affidavits if it informs the Company that it has
received any such communications and makes such communications available for
review by the Company or its Representatives at the New York offices of
Parents counsel. The Company and Parent each shall give prompt notice to the
other party of any change, fact or condition that is, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably expected to (i) with respect to the Company, result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) with respect to Parent, result in
a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) result in a failure of any
condition to the other partys obligations to effect the Merger.

 

6.6 _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Laws, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its
employees, properties, books, Contracts and records and, during such
period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ that, no investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of the Company would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality or
(ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6
shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the
Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements.

applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses
incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made and (3)
give each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employees
combined and continuous employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including any predecessors thereof), as well as for any service otherwise
recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time,

each applicable Parent benefit plan, as if such service had been performed

early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication
of benefits).

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing no later
than 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the
Company shall cause to be amended the employee benefit plans and arrangements

criteria to receive such a bonus for the pre-Closing portion of the year
ended December 31, 2016, as promptly as practicable following the Closing

immediately prior to the Effective Time. Except as set forth on Section
6.9(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, nothing contained in this Agreement
is intended to prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates from amending or terminating any Company Plan in accordance with
its terms after the Effective Time.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (1) be treated as an

its Subsidiaries (other than the Specified Entities) (in each case, when
acting in such capacity), determined as of the 

 



-67-  Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and in connection therewith
to provide advancement of expenses to such Indemnified Parties, to the fullest
extent such Indemnified Parties are indemnified or exculpated or have the
right to advancement of expenses under Delaware Law and the Companys
Fundamental Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor and maintain the provisions regarding the

unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies to the policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained immediately prior to

of the applicable policies in effect as of the date hereof and which
"tail" policies will provide only the side A coverage for Indemnified Parties
where the policies in-force also include Side B coverage) with a claims period
of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability at least as favorable
to such directors and officers as the Companys existing policies with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
by this Agreement); _provided_ , that in no event shall the Company expend for
such policies a premium amount in excess of the amount set forth in Section
6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company
shall, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as applicable,
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a premium not
exceeding such amount.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section

Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties and his or her heirs. The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11 may not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as

Indemnified Party, it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties will
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Fundamental Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any

be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors
and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in
existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed
that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.11 is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under any such policies. Parent will or
will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable and documented
expenses that may be incurred by an Indemnified Party in enforcing this
Section 6.11.

6.12 _Defense of Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly as practicable
notify Parent of any Proceeding brought by stockholders of the Company against
the Company or its directors or officers arising out of or relating to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which it
is a party, and to the extent practicable, shall consult with Parent
(including by giving Parent the right to review in advance, and comment with
respect to (which such comments the Company shall duly consider in
good faith), any pleading or filing made with, or other written materials to
be submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with any such
Proceeding), keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to any material
developments regarding the defense of any such Proceeding (including by
providing Parent with copies of all pleadings, filings and other written
correspondence or memoranda given to, or received from, any Governmental
Entity in connection with any such Proceeding) and shall give
due consideration in good faith to Parents advice with respect to any such
Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be entitled to
control any such Proceeding and shall be entitled to settle any such
Proceeding in its sole and absolute discretion to the extent such settlement
does not involve payments reasonably expected to exceed any insurance proceeds
that the Company reasonably expects to receive with respect to such Proceeding
(plus all related deductibles related to such insurance proceeds, if any),
but may not otherwise settle any such Proceedings without Parents consent,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and use reasonable
best efforts to take such actions as are necessary, and shall cause and direct
the Subsidiaries of the Company to grant such approvals and use
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary, so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement, and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to
attempt to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute on such
transactions.

Escrow Agent to establish the Escrow Account as soon as practicable after the

expense relating to the Parent Termination Fee, and of any damages, judgment,
decision or award (including any arbitration award) that may become due by
Parent or its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which, for this purpose only,
shall exclude the U.S. Life Restructuring), and which amount shall be held and
released by the Escrow Agent subject to the terms of this Agreement and the
Parent Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that the Escrow Agent shall
release the Parent Escrow Amount (together with any interest accrued thereon)

such outstanding debt obligations; and (b) on or prior to the consummation of
the Unstacking, $525,000,000 that, together with the $175,000,000 that the
Company has previously committed to make available for this purpose, will be
used to facilitate the Unstacking.

Proposal was made known to the Company, the Company Board, any committee of
the Company Board or senior management of the Company after the date of this
Agreement and was not withdrawn or rejected in writing by the Company Board,
or was publicly proposed or publicly disclosed to the Companys stockholders,
and was not publicly withdrawn, prior to the time of such termination), (B) in
the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.2(b), a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal was publicly proposed or publicly disclosed to the
Companys stockholders, and was not publicly withdrawn, prior to the taking of
a vote to

 



-75-  adopt this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting or any postponement or
adjournment thereof and (C) in each of the foregoing cases in clauses (A) and
(B), the conditions specified in clause (v) below for the payment of the
Company Termination Fee in the event of a termination pursuant to this Section
8.5(b)(iv) have been satisfied.

 

(v) If the Company is required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 8.5(b), the Company
Termination Fee shall be payable not later than two Business Days after
termination of this Agreement, in each case by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent. The Company Termination
Fee shall not be payable to Parent pursuant to Section 8.5(b)(iv) unless and
until, within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to
undertake, solicit stockholder approval for or consummate, or shall have
consummated, a transaction of the type referred to in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" (which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal
described in clause (iv) above) or, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal
made by way of a tender offer or exchange offer, shall have not recommended
that the Companys stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer
within the period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (for
purposes of this Section 8.5(b), substituting "50%" for "10%" in all instances
in which it appears in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"); _provided_
that, for purposes of this Section 8.5(b), an Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed not to have been "publicly withdrawn" by any Person if, within 12
months after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for the
consummation of, or shall have consummated, an Acquisition Proposal made by or
on behalf of the Person who made such initial Acquisition Proposal or any of
its Affiliates or, in the case of a new Acquisition Proposal made by way of a
tender offer or exchange offer by or on behalf of such Person or any of its
Affiliates, shall have not recommended that the Companys stockholders
reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the period specified in
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act. In the case where a Company Termination
Fee is payable by the Company to Parent pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Company will pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee upon the
earlier of the date that the Company enters into the relevant Alternative
Acquisition Agreement or the consummation of the relevant transaction. For the
avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 8.5(b), a sale of capital
stock of any of the Companys Subsidiaries to the public in an initial public
offering (including through an underwritten offering) after the termination of
this Agreement shall not, in and of itself and absent another transaction
qualifying as an "Acquisition Proposal" hereunder, cause the Company
Termination Fee to become payable.

 

(c) Parent shall, at the applicable time specified in this Section 8.5(c), pay
to the Company a fee equal to $210,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ")
if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:

(i) Section 8.2(a) by either the Company or Parent if, at the time of such
termination, all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at

 



-76-  the Closing, _provided_ that each of such conditions is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing), except for any one or more of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1(c), Section 7.1(e) (solely with respect to an applicable
Law or Order from a PRC Governmental Entity or any other Governmental Entity
in the PRC, Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan) or Section 7.2(c) (solely with respect
to any PRC Regulatory Approvals);

(ii) Section 8.2(c) (solely with respect to an applicable Law or Order from a
PRC Governmental Entity or any other Governmental Entity in the PRC, Hong
Kong, Macau or Taiwan) by either the Company or Parent; or

(iii) Section 8.3(a).

If Parent is required to pay the Company a Parent Termination Fee, Parent and
the Company shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
within two Business Days after termination of this Agreement, instructing the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Company, directly or out of the Parent Escrow
Amount, the Parent Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in U.S. Dollars to an account designated by the Company; _provided_
that, if Parent has paid or caused to be paid to the Company or any of its
designated Affiliates either (i) the Parent Termination Fee, together with any
other amounts payable by Parent to the Company with respect thereto pursuant
to Section 8.5(d)(ii), or (ii) the full amount of damages under an arbitration
award sought in accordance with the terms of Section 9.5(b); in each case,
whether directly or out of the Parent Escrow Amount, the funds remaining in
the Parent Escrow Amount, if any, shall be simultaneously released and
returned to Parent or any of its designated Affiliates.

 

(d) The parties each agree that (i) the agreements contained in this Section
8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not have entered
into this Agreement and (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation
and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section
8.5(c) are not a penalty but rather constitute amounts akin to
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, (i) if the Company fails promptly
to pay any amounts due under this Section 8.5 and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment against the
Company for such amounts, the Company shall pay interest on such amounts from
the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the
rate of interest published from time to time in  _The Wall Street Journal_ ,
_Table of Money Rates_ (or any successor publication thereto), designated
therein as the prime rate on the date such payment was due, together with the
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) in connection with such Proceeding and (ii) if Parent
fails promptly to pay any amounts due under this Section 8.5 and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company commences a Proceeding that results in a
judgment against Parent for such amounts, Parent shall pay interest on such
amounts from the date payment of such amounts was due to the date of actual
payment at the rate of interest published from time to time in _The Wall
Street _

 



-77-   _Journal_ , _Table of Money Rates_ (or any successor publication thereto),
designated therein as the prime rate on the date such payment was due,
together with the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Company
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such
Proceeding.

 

(e) (i) Subject to Section 9.5(c), notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, if Parent or Merger Sub fails to effect the
Closing for any or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to
perform hereunder, then, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and all members of the Company Group against (A) Parent
or Merger Sub, (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity,
partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or assignees of Parent or
Merger Sub, or (C) any holders or future holders of any equity, stock,
partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, assignees of any of the
foregoing (clauses (A)-(C), collectively, the " _Parent Group_ ") for any loss
or damage suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or failure to perform hereunder (including fraud or
willful or intentional breach) by Parent or Merger Sub or other failure of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement shall be to
terminate this Agreement as provided under this Agreement, and either (1)
receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee, pursuant to Section 8.5(c) and
other amounts pursuant to Section 8.5(d), if any, and upon receipt of the
Parent Termination Fee, and such other amounts, if any, neither Parent nor any
other member of the Parent Group shall have any liability for monetary damages
of any kind or nature or arising in any circumstance in connection with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
or (2) solely in the event of fraud or willful or intentional breach by Parent
or Merger Sub, seek any arbitration award for damages in accordance with the
terms of Section 9.5(b). Subject to Section 9.5(c), in no event (including
fraud or willful or intentional breach by Parent or Merger Sub) shall (A) the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) the former, current and future holders
of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or assignees of
the Company, or (C) any holders or future holders of any equity, stock,
partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, assignees of any of the
foregoing (clauses (A)-(C), collectively, the " _Company Group_ ") seek, or
permit to be sought, on behalf of any member of the Company Group or be
entitled to, any monetary damages from or arbitration award against any
member of the Parent Group in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereunder, if the Parent Termination Fee is paid
pursuant to Section 8.5(c) and the other related amounts, if any, are paid
pursuant to 
Section 8.5(d); _provided_ , _however_ , nothing herein shall affect any
rights of, or remedies available to, the Specified Entities under any Contract
between a Specified Entity, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand. If any member of the Company Group were to seek
any arbitration award in accordance with the terms of the foregoing clause (2)
and Section 9.5(b), upon the final rendering of any 

 



-78-  arbitration award in accordance with the terms of Section 9.5(b), the
Company shall be deemed to have waived its right under Section 8.5(c) to
receive the Parent Termination Fee.

 

(ii) Subject to Section 9.5(c), notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, if the Company fails to effect the Closing for any
or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform
hereunder, then, the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and all
members of the Parent Group against the Company Group for any loss or damage
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement or failure to perform hereunder (including fraud or willful or
intentional breach) by the Company or other failure of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated in this Agreement shall be to terminate this
Agreement as provided under this Agreement, and either (1) receive payment of
the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b) and other amounts
pursuant to Section 8.5(d), if any, and upon receipt of the Company
Termination Fee and such other amounts, if any, neither the Company nor any
other member of the Company Group shall have any liability for monetary
damages of any kind or nature or arising in any circumstance in connection
with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement or (2) solely in the event of fraud or willful or intentional breach
by the Company, seek any arbitration award in accordance with the terms of
Section 9.5(b). Subject to Section 9.5(c), in no event (including fraud or
willful or intentional breach by the Company) shall Parent, Merger Sub or any
member of the Parent Group seek, or permit to be sought, on behalf of any
member of the Parent Group or be entitled to, any monetary damages from or
arbitration award against any member of the Company Group in connection with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereunder, if the
Company Termination Fee is paid pursuant to Section 8.5(c) and the other
related amounts, if any, are paid pursuant to Section 8.5(d). If any member of
the Parent Group were to seek any arbitration award in accordance with the
terms of Section 9.5(b), upon the final rendering of any arbitration award in
accordance with the terms of Section 9.5(b), the Parent shall be deemed to
have waived its right under Section 8.5(b) to receive the Company Termination
Fee.

 

(iii) In no event shall the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other
hand, be required to pay to the other party more than one Company Termination
Fee or Parent Termination Fee, if and as applicable, pursuant to this Section
8.5.

(f) For purposes of this Section 8.5, the following terms have the respective
meanings specified:

" _willful or intentional breach_ " means that the breaching party (i) made a
representation or warranty in this Agreement with the actual knowledge (as
opposed to imputed or constructive knowledge) as of the date of this Agreement
that such representation or warranty was not true or correct in any material
respect or (ii) breached a covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement
in any material respect with the actual knowledge (as opposed to imputed or
constructive knowledge), at the time of such breach, that such covenant or
obligation was being breached.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that, in order to obtain prompt and
expeditious resolution of all disputes arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Parent Escrow Agreement, Escrow Deposit Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letter, including the existence, validity, interpretation or
performance of this Agreement, the Parent Escrow Agreement, Escrow
Deposit Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Parent Escrow Agreement, Escrow Deposit
Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any claim arising 

 



-80-  out of or related to the parties relationship, rights, duties and
obligations hereunder, whether based on contract, tort or statute, and the
substantive or procedural arbitrability of any claim hereunder), all such
disputes shall be exclusively resolved by final and binding arbitration under
the Delaware Rapid Arbitration Act (the "DRAA", 10 _Del. C_. § 5801 _et
seq_.) and the Delaware Rapid Arbitration Rules promulgated thereunder by the
Supreme Court of the State of Delaware ("Rules") in effect at the time of the
date of delivery of the notice of arbitration, except as modified herein. The
parties agree to take all steps necessary or advisable in order properly to
submit any such dispute for arbitration in accordance with this Section 9.5,
and each party covenants and agrees that it is not a "consumer" as such term
is defined in Section 2731 of Title 6 of the Delaware Code. Each party hereto
also acknowledges and agrees that, by executing this Agreement, it shall be
deemed by operation of Law to have waived objection and consented to the
procedures set forth in the DRAA and that it has chosen freely to waive the
matters set forth in Section 5803(b) and (c) of the DRAA. IN CONNECTION
THEREWITH, EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH
CONTROVERSY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

(i) The arbitral panel shall consist of three arbitrators (the " _Tribunal_
"). The situs of the arbitration will be the State of Delaware, although the
evidentiary and other proceedings will be conducted in New York (Manhattan),
New York. The Tribunal may conduct proceedings in other locations if
necessary for the taking of evidence. The language of the arbitration
proceedings, and of the arbitral award, shall be the English language. The
parties hereto agree that (A) the claimant(s), on the one hand, and
respondent(s), on the other hand, shall each appoint one arbitrator within 20
days after the date of delivery of the notice of arbitration; and (B) the two
party-appointed arbitrators shall appoint the third arbitrator, who
shall serve as the chair of the Tribunal, within 20 days after the date of
the appointment of the second arbitrator. Each member of the Tribunal must be
impartial and shall be knowledgeable about and experienced with the practice
of law and with the Laws of the State of Delaware ( _provided_ that it is not
required for the members of the Tribunal to be admitted to practice law in the
State of Delaware) and have had at least 15 years of legal experience in the
area of mergers and acquisitions or complex commercial transactions. Any
arbitrator not timely appointed as provided in clause (A) or (B) of this
Section 9.5(b)(i) shall be appointed by the Delaware Court of Chancery in
accordance with Section 5805 of the DRAA. If the Tribunal retains counsel in
consultation with the parties hereto under Section 5806 of the DRAA, such

 



-81-  counsel shall also be impartial and shall be knowledgeable about and
experienced with the practice of law and have had at least 15 years of legal
experience in the area of mergers and acquisitions or complex commercial
transactions. Only the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will have
the power and authority to appoint a new arbitrator in the event any
arbitrator becomes unable to continue as arbitrator for any reason. 

(ii) The arbitration shall be deemed commenced on the date when the third
member of the Tribunal has accepted his or her appointment. The parties
hereto agree that any service or written communication (including, the answer,
any reply or exchange of information) under the DRAA or the Rules shall be
made in a manner provided in Section 9.6, or as otherwise agreed by the
parties. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub
irrevocably appoints Corporation Service Company as its agent for service of
process or of any such notice or written communication for purposes of any
Proceeding in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties hereto agree that the preliminary conference
shall be held no later than 10 days after the constitution of the Tribunal. In
connection with any arbitration proceeding hereunder, the Tribunal shall
allow reasonable requests for the production of documents relevant to the
dispute and permit the taking of depositions limited to not more than five
individuals on each side and for not more than six hours in total for the
deposition of each such person. Where reasonably necessary, depositions may be
taken by videoconference or other telephonic means, or in the jurisdiction
where a witness resides or regularly transacts business. The Tribunal shall
have the power to issue subpoenas and commissions for the taking of documents
and testimony from non-parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law. The arbitration hearing shall be limited to one day, if the Tribunal
deems such limitation appropriate ( _provided_ that the Tribunal may, if it
considers it appropriate in order to provide any party with a full and fair
opportunity to be heard, require a hearing be held over the course of more
than one day) and shall be conducted as soon as reasonably practicable after
the constitution of the Tribunal, as determined by the Tribunal.

(iii) The parties to this Agreement agree that, subject to any non-waivable
disclosure obligations under applicable Laws, the arbitration, and all matters
relating thereto or arising thereunder, including, without limitation, the
existence of the arbitration proceedings (including any pleadings, briefs or
other documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral
submissions, any third-party discovery proceedings, including any discovery
obtained pursuant thereto, and any decision by the Tribunal or final award)
shall be kept strictly confidential, and each party hereby agrees that such
information shall not be disclosed beyond: (i) the Tribunal and necessary
support personnel; (ii) the participants in the arbitration; (iii) those
assisting the parties in the preparation or presentation of the Tribunal;
(iv) Representatives of the parties with a need to know such information; and
(v) any non-parties that are subpoenaed or otherwise provide discovery in the
arbitration proceedings, only to the extent necessary to obtain such
discovery. The parties participating in the arbitration proceedings shall use
their reasonable best efforts, and shall cause third parties participating in
such proceedings to use reasonable best efforts, to treat information
pertaining to the arbitration with the same care that they treat their
confidential and non-public business information. In the event that applicable
Law

 



-82-  imposes upon a party an obligation to disclose the fact of the arbitration
or the nature of the claims or counter-claims asserted, such party or parties
shall disclose no more than the minimum information required by such
applicable Law after first consulting with and attempting in good faith to
reach agreement with the opposing party or parties regarding the scope and
content or any such required disclosure.

 

(iv) For the purposes of Section 5808(b) of the DRAA, and for all other
purposes, the Tribunal shall issue its final award as promptly as
practicable, taking into account the nature of the claims and any other facts
or circumstances the Tribunal deems relevant, but in no event later than 150
calendar days after the third member of the Tribunal has accepted his or
her appointment. The parties agree that the Tribunal may, to the extent
permissible under the DRAA, extend any deadline set forth in Section
9.5(b)(ii) and (b)(iv) if, in its discretion, more time is needed in light of
the nature of the claims and the relevant facts and circumstances. The
Tribunal is authorized to award monetary damages and to grant specific
performance of this Agreement and other injunctive relief, including interim
relief pending the final award. The parties hereto shall bear their own costs
incurred in connection with the arbitration and share equally the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of administration.

 

(v) Nothing in this Section 9.5(b) shall prevent a party from seeking
provisional, interim or conservatory measures from the Delaware Court of
Chancery at any time if any such party believes in good faith that it will
suffer irreparable injury before the Tribunal has been appointed. Any such
request by a party to a court for provisional, interim or conservatory
measures shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate in
this Section 9.5(b), the DRAA or a waiver of the right to arbitrate.

 

(vi) The arbitral award shall be final and non-appealable. Judgment upon the
arbitral award may be entered and enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The parties hereto hereby agree to waive any claim that this
agreement to arbitrate is not valid under the Laws of the United States, any
foreign country or any international agreement.

 

(vii) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and
agree that any legal proceeding conducted under this Section 9.5(b) shall be
governed by and construed under the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to principles of conflict of Laws and regardless of whether the Laws of
the State of Delaware govern the parties other rights, remedies,
liabilities, powers and duties.

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement (including that the Company shall be
entitled to cause Parent to enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment
Letter pursuant to the terms thereof), without proof of actual damages (and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which such party is entitled at law or 

 



-83-  in equity; _provided_ that, after any termination of this Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 9.5(c) shall survive only with respect to those
provisions of this Agreement which survive the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to the provisions of the second sentence of Section 9.1. If, prior to
the End Date, any party hereto brings any Proceeding in accordance with this
Section 9.5 to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other party, the End Date shall be automatically
extended (x) for the period during which such Proceeding is pending, plus 10
Business Days or (y) by such other time period established by the Tribunal or
court presiding over such action, as the case may be.

(d) With respect to the liability and obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and
their Affiliates, each of Parent and Merger Sub, with respect to themselves,
their Affiliates and their property:

 

(i) agrees that, for the purposes of the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the
execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement constitutes
private and commercial acts done for private and commercial purposes;

(ii) agrees that, should any Proceeding be brought against it, any of its
Affiliates or any of its or its Affiliates assets in any jurisdiction in
relation to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with Section 8.5(e)(i) and this Section 9.5, neither Parent or
Merger Sub, nor any of their Affiliates, shall be entitled to any immunity on
the basis of sovereignty in respect of any obligations under this Agreement,
and no immunity on the basis of sovereignty from such Proceeding (including
immunity from service of process from suit, from the jurisdiction of any
court, from pre-judgment attachment or an order or injunction of such court or
the enforcement of same against its assets) shall be claimed by or on behalf
of such Person or with respect to its assets;

(iii) waives, in any such Proceeding, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any right of immunity on the basis of sovereignty which it, any of its
Affiliates or any of its assets now has or may acquire in the future in any
jurisdiction; and

 

(iv) specifies that, for the purposes of this Section 9.5(d), "assets" shall
be taken as excluding "premises of the mission" as defined in the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations signed at Vienna, April 18, 1961, "consular
premises" as defined in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations signed in
1963, and military property or military assets or property of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Affiliates, or of any country.

9.6 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing in the English
language and delivered personally or sent by registered or certified mail,

provided by the DGCL or by the Certificate of Incorporation. Where a separate

established for the meeting. Any copy, facsimile communication or other
reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this
paragraph may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or
transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may, and to the extent required by
law, shall, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each
inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take

voting on the election of directors shall be by written ballot. Voting on
other matters may be by voice vote, except if otherwise required by law or by
the Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that a vote by written
ballot shall be taken if the chairman of the meeting so elects or if so
demanded by a stockholder.

(e) The requirement, if any, of a written ballot may be satisfied by a
ballot submitted by electronic transmission, provided that any such
electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information
from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was
authorized by the stockholder or proxyholder.

2.7 _Waiver of Notice_.

 

Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL or of
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof,
signed by the person entitled to notice, or waiver by electronic mail or other
electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time
stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a
person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting,
except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting,
at the beginning of the meeting, to

 



A2-4  the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called
or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any
written waiver of notice, or any waiver of notice by electronic transmission,
unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

 

2.8 _Stockholder Action By Written Consent Without A Meeting_.

of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and (ii) delivered to
the Corporation in accordance with Section 228(a) of the DGCL.

days after the date the earliest dated consent is delivered to the
Corporation, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of
holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner
prescribed in this Section 2.8. An electronic mail or other electronic
transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a
stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a
stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated
for purposes of this Section to the extent permitted by law. Any such consent
shall be delivered in accordance with Section 228(d)(1) of the DGCL.

(c) Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in
writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and
all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such
copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the
entire original writing.

(d) Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting
by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders
who have not consented in writing (including by electronic mail or other
electronic transmission as permitted by law). If the action which
is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate
under any section of the DGCL if such action had been voted on by stockholders
at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall
state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote
of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as

(a) A director of this Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation
thereof is not permitted under the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
existing hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such
repeal or modification.

 

(b) Each person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a
party to, witness or other participant in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), by
reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or has or
had agreed to become a director of the Corporation, or, while a director or
officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans (an "Indemnitee"), whether the basis of the Proceeding
is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any
other capacity while serving as a director or officer, shall be indemnified by
the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or other
applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the
case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted
the Corporation to provide before such amendment), against all liability and
loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA
excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred
by Indemnitee in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3 of this Article VI, the
Corporation shall be required to indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a
Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnitee only if the
commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Indemnitee was
authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors.

 

6.2 _Indemnification Of Others_.

 

The Corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner
permitted by the DGCL or other applicable state law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide
before such amendment), to indemnify each of its employees and agents against
all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees,
judgments, fines,

 



A2-14  ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred by such employee or agent in connection therewith. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3 of this
Article VI, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify such employee or
agent in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such
employee or agent only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part
thereof) by such employee or agent was authorized in the specific case by the
Board of Directors. For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent"
of the Corporation includes any person other than a director or officer who
(i) is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation, (ii) is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii)
was an employee or agent of a corporation that was a predecessor corporation
of the Corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor
corporation.

 

6.3 _Payment Of Expenses In Advance_.

 

Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any Proceeding for
which indemnification is required pursuant to Section 6.1 shall be, or for
which indemnification is permitted pursuant to Section 6.2 following
authorization thereof by the Board of Directors may be, paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding; provided,
however, that to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in
advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking by the or on behalf of the indemnified party to
repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI. If a claim for
indemnification (following the final disposition of such Proceeding) or
advancement of expenses under this Article VI is not paid in full within
thirty days after a written claim therefor by the indemnified person has been
received by the Corporation, such indemnified person may file suit to recover
the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall
be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such
action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the indemnified
person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of
expenses under applicable law.

6.4 _Indemnity Not Exclusive_.

 

The indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of these Bylaws, the
Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

 



A2-15 6.5 _Insurance_.

 

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her
and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the DGCL.

 

6.6 _Amendments_.

 

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VI
shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of
any indemnified person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such repeal or modification.

 

6.7 _Other Indemnification and Prepayment of Expenses_.

 

This Article VI shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent
and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to
persons other than Indemnitees when and as authorized by appropriate corporate
action.

ARTICLE VII

 

 _RECORDS AND REPORTS_

 

7.1 _Maintenance And Inspection Of Records_.

 

(a) The Corporation shall, either at its principal executive offices or at
such place or places as designated by the Board of Directors, keep a record
of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class
of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these Bylaws as amended to date,
accounting books and other records.

 

(b) Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent,
shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the
right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose
the Corporations stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other
books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose
shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such persons interest as a
stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person
who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied
by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or
other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath
shall be directed to the Corporation at its registered office in Delaware or
at its principal place of business.

(c) A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of stock and
showing the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares
registered in each such stockholders name, shall 

 



A2-16  be open to the examination of any such stockholder for a period of at least
10 days before the meeting to the extent and in the manner provided by law.
The stock list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder
during the whole time of the meeting as provided by law. This list shall
presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them. 

7.2 _Inspection By Directors_.

 

Any director shall have the right to examine the Corporations stock ledger, a
list of its stockholders, and its other books and records for a purpose
reasonably related to his or her position as a director.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _GENERAL MATTERS_

 

8.1 _Checks_.

 

From time to time, the Board of Directors shall determine by resolution which
person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for
payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in
the name of or payable to the Corporation, and only the persons so authorized
shall sign or endorse those instruments.

 

8.2 _Execution Of Corporate Contracts And Instruments_.

 

The Board of Directors may, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws,
authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any
contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the
Corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.
Unless so authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors or within the
agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any
power or authority to bind the Corporation by any contract or engagement or to
pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.

 

8.3 _Stock Certificates_.

or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant
treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation.
Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case
any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile
signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer,
transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be
issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such
officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

 

No stock certificates will be issued in bearer form.

 



A2-17 8.4 _Special Designation On Certificates_.

preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights
of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations
or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full
or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the Corporation
shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however,
that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the DGCL, in lieu of the
foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the
certificate that the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series
of stock a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each
stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences,
and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each
class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

 

8.5 _Lost Certificates_.

 

Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall
be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is
surrendered to the Corporation and cancelled at the same time. The Corporation
may issue a new certificate of stock in the place of any certificate
previously issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen, mutilated
or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed certificate, or the owners legal representative, to
give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that
may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft, mutilation or
destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

 

8.6 _Construction; Definitions_.

 

Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of
construction, and definitions in the DGCL shall govern the construction of
these Bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular
number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the
term "person" includes both a corporation (or other entity) and a
natural person.

The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board
of Directors and may be changed by the Board of Directors.

The Corporation may adopt a corporate seal, which may be altered at pleasure,
and may use the same by causing it or a facsimile thereof, to be impressed or
affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

 



A2-18 8.9 _Transfers of Stock_.

 

Transfers of stock shall be made only upon the transfer books of the
Corporation kept at an office of the Corporation or by transfer
agents designated to transfer shares of the stock of the Corporation.

8.10 _Registered Stockholders_. 

The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person
registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to
vote as such owner and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other
claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person,
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except
as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

8.11 _Facsimile Signature_.

 

In addition to the provisions for use of facsimile signatures elsewhere
specifically authorized in these Bylaws, facsimile signatures of any officer
or officers of the Corporation may be used whenever and as authorized by the
Board of Directors or a committee thereof.

ARTICLE IX __

_AMENDMENTS_

 

The Bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the
stockholders entitled to vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that no bylaw may be
adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders except by the vote or written
consent of at least a majority of the voting power of the Corporation. The
Corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power
to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws upon the Board of Directors. The fact that
such power has been so conferred upon the Board of Directors shall not divest
the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power, to adopt, amend or
repeal Bylaws as set forth in this Article IX.

interest in BLAIC to Genworth North America Corporation. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | BLAIC merged with and into Genworth Life Insurance

---|---|---|--- 



      |  |  | The Separation Plan includes the following steps: __

     |  |  | The Company will discuss the transfer of GLAICs 34.5%
ownership interest in GLICNY to GLIC (the " _GLICNY Transfer_ ") with the

reasonable actions to explore the feasibility of the GLICNY Transfer and, if
approval from such Governmental Entities is received, to pursue the GLICNY
Transfer; _provided, however,_ that the Company shall be under no obligation
to effectuate the GLICNY Transfer and any such transfer would be subject to
receipt of any required regulatory approvals. For the avoidance of doubt, the
GLICNY Transfer is not part of the Unstacking, and neither the GLICNY
