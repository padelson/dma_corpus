of franking debits and franking credits for the purposes of Australian Tax law and has also provided valid distribution statements (for Australian Tax law purposes).&nbsp;No Australian Subsidiary has ever had any permanent establishment (as that

all applicable Laws with respect thereto, including with respect to the pricing of goods or services provided to or by the Company or any Subsidiary, and with respect to the preparation of documents or records required under applicable transfer
pricing Laws. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into or been a party to any transaction which contravenes any anti-avoidance provisions of any Tax Law that would result in a material amount
