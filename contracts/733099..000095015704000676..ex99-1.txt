or waive any  confidentiality, non-solicitation or standstill agreement to
which such  third party is a party; and  (d) immediately to cease to
provide any other party with access to  information concerning the
Corporation and the Subsidiaries and request,  in accordance with the
confidentiality agreement signed with such  parties, the return or
destruction of all confidential information  provided to any third party that
has entered into a confidentiality  agreement with the Corporation relating
to any potential Acquisition  Proposal.  5. ACQUISITION PROPOSALS, CHANGES
IN RECOMMENDATION, ETC.  5.1 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS   The Corporation shall
provide the Offeror with a copy of (i) any written notice from any person
informing it that such person is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any Acquisition Proposal (or any amendment
thereto), in each case as soon as practicable after it is received by the
Corporation.  5.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION   If the Corporation receives a
written request for non-public information relating to the Corporation and/or
the Subsidiaries or any of them in connection with an Acquisition    
-26-   Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the
Corporation and/or the Subsidiaries or any of them from a person who shall
have made or intends to make an Acquisition Proposal and the Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal
advisors that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Board\'s fiduciary duties and that such proposal, if consummated, in
accordance with its terms, is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal, then:  (a) the Corporation may, subject to entering into a
confidentiality agreement  containing a standstill provision substantially
similar to that contained  in the Confidentiality Agreement, provide such
person with access to such  information; and  (b) subject to any
restrictions in that regard contained in the  Confidentiality Agreement, the
Offeror will be provided with a list of or  copies of the information and
access to similar information as that  provided to such person, except to the
extent such information was  already provided or made available to the
Offeror.  5.3 CHANGES IN RECOMMENDATION   If the Corporation receives an
Acquisition Proposal, the Corporation may withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to the Offeror its approval or recommendation of the Offers or
accept, approve, recommend or enter into any agreement in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal (other than the confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 5.2(a)) on the basis that such an Acquisition Proposal would
constitute a Superior Proposal if:  (a) the Corporation has given notice to
the Offeror of its intention to do  so, which notice shall disclose the fees
and expenses payable to the  Corporation\'s financial advisors referred to in
Section 3.2(m) in respect  of the completion of such Acquisition Proposal
together with, in the case  of an Acquisition Proposal that includes non-cash
consideration, the  value or range of values attributed by the Board in good
faith for such  non-cash consideration after consultation with its financial
advisors;  (b) the Corporation has complied with this Section 5;  (c) the
Corporation is not in default under Section 4.1(e)(i)-(v), 4.2(c),  4.3 or
4.4 of this Agreement; and  (d) five Business Days shall have elapsed from
the later of (i) the date the  Offeror received the notice referred to in
Section 5.3(a) and (ii) the  date the Offeror was provided with a copy of
such Acquisition Proposal.  5.4 RIGHT TO MATCH   The Offeror may, but is
not required to, during the five Business Day period provided for in Section
5.3(d), offer in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement and, if it does
so, then the Board shall review any such offer in good faith, in consultation
with its financial and outside legal advisors and, if the Board:    
-27-   (a) determines that the Acquisition Proposal would thereby cease to
be a  Superior Proposal, it will cause the Corporation to enter into an 
amendment to this Agreement reflecting the offer by the Offeror to amend  the
terms hereof; or  (b) continues to believe that the Acquisition Proposal
would nonetheless  remain a Superior Proposal, provided that the Corporation
has paid to the  Offeror the Termination Fee in accordance with the terms of
Section 9.2,  it may cause the Corporation to reject the offer by the Offeror
to amend  the terms hereof and terminate this Agreement as provided in
Section 8.2.  5.5 AMENDMENTS TO ACQUISITION PROPOSALS   For greater
certainty, any amendment of an Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new
Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 5.  6. COVENANTS OF
THE OFFEROR  6.1 OFFERS   Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
Offeror hereby agrees to:  (a) provide copies of drafts of the Offers to the
Corporation and its  advisors, in order to provide them with an opportunity
to comment thereon  (it being agreed that the final form and content of the
Offers (except  for those terms and conditions described in Schedule A
hereto, which will  form part of the Offers) shall be determined by the
Offeror, consistent  with the terms hereof);  (b) apply for and use all
reasonable efforts to obtain all required  regulatory and other approvals and
clearances, including those identified  in Schedule B, other than Competition
Act Clearance, and make all  necessary filings and notifications in order to
permit the transactions  contemplated hereby to proceed together with all
consents and other  approvals of third parties as may be necessary or
desirable for the  consummation of such transactions;  (c) subject to
Section 7.2, use all reasonable efforts to secure Competition  Act Clearance,
including but not limited to:   (i) promptly filing all required
notification(s) under Part IX of the  Competition Act; and   (ii) promptly
co-operating with and providing all necessary information  and documentation
reasonably required by the Commissioner of  Competition or her authorized
representative upon being requested to  do so by such authority;   The
Offeror shall:     -28-    (A) promptly notify the Corporation of
material written communications  from the Commissioner of Competition or her
authorized  representative and provide the Corporation with copies thereof;
and   (B) permit the Corporation to review in advance any material
proposed  written communications with the Commissioner of Competition or
her  authorized representative, and provide the Corporation with final 
copies thereof, except in case (A) and (B) above, to the extent of  any
Highly Confidential Information (as defined in the  Confidentiality
Agreement), which Highly Confidential Information  shall be provided only to
the external legal counsel of the  Corporation and shall not be shared by
such counsel with any other  person;  (d) if all of the conditions of the
Offers are either met or, if applicable,  waived at or prior to the expiry of
the Offers, the Offeror shall take up  the Securities deposited under the
Offers and pay for such Securities as  soon as practicable after, and in any
event within two Business Days of,  the first date on which the Offeror is
permitted to do so under  applicable securities laws;  (e) in the event
that the Offeror increases the consideration per Security  offered under the
Offers (but, for greater certainty, excluding any  greater consideration paid
as a consequence of a Compulsory Acquisition  Transaction), the Offeror will
pay such increased consideration to each  holder of Securities in respect of
all Securities tendered,  notwithstanding that such Securities have
previously been taken up and  paid for by the Offeror;  (f) if it takes up
and pays for Securities pursuant to the Offers, use all  commercially
reasonable efforts to acquire the remaining Securities,  within a period not
exceeding 120 days after the date of completion of  the Offers, by way of
Compulsory Acquisition or Subsequent Acquisition  Transaction for a
consideration equal to the consideration under the  Offers for each class of
Securities;  (g) following the Effective Date, it will cause the Corporation
to duly and  timely perform its obligations pursuant to (i) the compensation
policy of  the Corporation in respect of its directors and (ii) the
Corporation\'s  employment arrangements with officers and employees;
and  (h) without limitation to any other provision hereof, use all
reasonable  efforts to defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory or
other  proceedings challenging or affecting this Agreement or the
consummation  of the transactions contemplated hereby.  6.2 STOCK OPTION
PLAN AND RETENTION PLAN   The Offeror acknowledges and agrees that:    
-29-   (a) the Board may resolve to permit all persons holding Options,
which by  their terms are otherwise currently exercisable or not, to exercise
such  Options concurrent with the expiry of the Offers, including by
causing  the vesting thereof to be accelerated;  (b) the Board may
authorize the cancellation of Options concurrent with the  expiry of the
Offers in consideration for cash and/or Shares issued, in  each case in lieu
of the cash value thereof;  (c) it shall agree with the Corporation to
tendering arrangements in respect  of the Offers in order to facilitate the
conditional exercise of the  Options and tender of the Shares to be issued as
a result of such  conditional exercise (including providing for the ability
of holders of  Options to tender their Options or to tender Shares on the
basis of  guaranteed deliveries);  (d) (i) holders of Options will be
permitted to tender Shares issuable  thereunder and for such purpose to
exercise their Options, conditional  upon the Offeror taking up and paying
for the Shares under the Offers,  which Options shall be deemed to have been
exercised concurrently with  the take-up of Shares and (ii) all Shares that
are to be issued pursuant  to any such conditional exercise shall be accepted
as validly tendered  under the Offers, provided that the holders of such
Options indicate that  the Shares are tendered pursuant to the Offers and
otherwise validly  accept the Offers in accordance with their terms with
respect to such  Shares;  (e) if certain holders of Options do not exercise
and tender their Options as  contemplated under Section 6.2(d), the Offeror
shall offer to pay to such  holders, in respect of each Share subject to an
Option, the cash amount,  if any, by which the purchase price for the Shares
under the Offers  exceeds the exercise price of such Option on the date of
take-up of, and  payment for, the Shares under the Offers, in exchange for
the termination  of their Options; and  (f) (i) subject to obtaining the
consent of the Offeror, such consent not to  be unreasonably withheld, the
Board may establish a new retention pool  for the benefit of certain or all
of its key employees and officers so as  to retain them until the Effective
Date and (ii) the Board is entitled on  or before the Effective Date to
prepay the amounts which may become  payable pursuant to the Corporation\'s
existing retention plan and  existing employment arrangements with its
officers and employees.  6.3 DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INSURANCE AND
INDEMNITIES  (a) Without limiting the right of the Corporation to do so
prior to the  Effective Date, the Offeror hereby agrees to use its
reasonable  commercial efforts to secure directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance  coverage for the current and former directors and officers of
the  Corporation and the Subsidiaries on a six year "trailing" (or "run-
off")  basis. If a trailing policy is not available at a reasonable cost,
then  the Offeror agrees that for the entire period from the Effective
Date     -30-    until six years after the Effective Date, the Offeror
will cause the  Corporation or any successor to the Corporation to maintain
the  Corporation\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policy  or Equivalent Insurance having in either case terms and conditions
no  less advantageous in any material respect to the directors and officers 
of the Corporation or the Subsidiaries (with respect to their acting as 
directors or officers thereof) than those contained in the policy in  effect
on the date hereof, for all current and former directors and  officers of the
Corporation or the Subsidiaries, covering claims made  prior to or within six
years after the Effective Date. Further, the  Offeror agrees that, after the
expiration of that six year period, if  there is no cost in doing so, the
Offeror shall use reasonable commercial  efforts to cause such directors and
officers to be covered under the  Offeror\'s then existing directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance  policy.  (b) From and after the Effective
Date, the Offeror shall not do anything to  prevent the Corporation from
indemnifying and hold harmless and providing  advancement of expenses to, all
past and present directors and officers  of the Corporation or the
Subsidiaries to the extent such persons are  lawfully entitled to indemnity
from the Corporation or the Subsidiaries  or have the right to advancement of
expenses as of the date of this  Agreement by the Corporation or the
Subsidiaries pursuant to the  Corporation\'s or Subsidiaries\' by-laws and
indemnity agreements, in  existence immediately prior to the Effective Date,
for acts or omissions  occurring on or prior to the Effective Date (including
acts or omissions  occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). The
Offeror will  not (unless it assumes such obligations and gives written
notice to the  beneficiaries thereof to the extent it has their addresses)
liquidate the  Corporation or otherwise take any other action to materially
adversely  affect the ability of the Corporation to satisfy its indemnity 
obligations referred to herein.  (c) The provisions of this Section 6.3 are
intended to be for the benefit of,  and will be enforceable by, each insured
or indemnified party, his or her  heirs and his or her legal representatives.
Furthermore, the provisions  of this Section 6.3 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement as a  result of the occurrence of the Effective
Date.  6.4 CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT   The Offeror hereby confirms that it
remains bound by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof, except to the extent modified hereby and
notwithstanding that this Agreement may be terminated for any reason
whatsoever.  7. FURTHER ASSURANCES  7.1 SATISFACTION OF CONDITIONS OF THE
OFFERS   Subject to the conditions herein provided, each party hereto agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all action and to do, or cause to be     -31-   done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly
as is practicable the transactions contemplated by the Offers and this
Agreement, including the execution and delivery of such documents as the
other party hereto may reasonably require, and, without limiting the
foregoing, shall use commercially reasonable efforts:  (a) to obtain all
necessary government or regulatory approvals, waivers,  permits, consents,
reviews, orders, rulings, decisions, and exemptions  (including, among
others, those of Industry Canada and of any stock  exchanges or other
securities or regulatory authorities) and waiver or  expiration of all
waiting or suspensory periods, in each case required to  be obtained by
it;  (b) to satisfy (or cause the satisfaction of) the conditions of the
Offers  set forth in Schedule A to this Agreement, the satisfaction of which
are  under its control, provided that the Corporation is not responsible
for  obtaining the approvals and clearances identified in Schedule B
hereto,  except to the extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this 
Agreement;  (c) to oppose, lift or rescind any cease trade order, injunction
or other  prohibition or other order which adversely affects the Offeror\'s
ability  to consummate the Offers, to take up and pay for the Securities or
to  complete a Compulsory Acquisition or Subsequent Acquisition
Transaction;  and  (d) to effect all necessary registrations, filings and
applications under all  applicable laws.  Each of the parties hereto, where
appropriate, shall reasonably co-operate with the other in taking such
actions.  7.2 COMPETITION ACT   Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement, including Schedule A hereto:   (a) if the Commissioner of
Competition advises the Offeror that she has  concerns about the competitive
impact of the transactions  contemplated by the Offers and this Agreement,
and that Competition  Act Clearance will be given if certain steps are taken
to resolve  those concerns, the Offeror shall take any steps necessary to
secure  Competition Act Clearance (including negotiating, offering to take 
and, if such offer is accepted, effecting by consent agreement or  order,
hold separate arrangement, undertaking or otherwise, the  divestiture of
assets, or undertaking of any form of behavioural  remedy, however, not
including the divestiture of all of the  Securities or all or substantially
all of the assets of the  Corporation and its Subsidiaries), so as to enable
the transactions  contemplated by the Offers and this Agreement to be
completed prior  to the Outside Date; and   (b) subject to Section 7.2(a)
above, the Offeror shall be entitled,  either before and/or after the Outside
Date or the date on which the  Securities are taken     -32-    up, to
challenge before the Commissioner of Competition, the Competition  Tribunal
and/or a court any position(s) taken by the Commissioner of 
Competition.  8. TERM AND TERMINATION  8.1 TERM   Except as expressly
provided herein, this Agreement shall be effective from the date hereof until
the earlier of the Effective Date and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.  8.2 TERMINATION BY THE CORPORATION   The
Corporation, when not in default in the performance of its
material obligations under this Agreement and when not in breach of its

any other rights, terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written
notice to the Offeror if:  (a) the Offers have not been made within the

or before the date that is two Business Days after the expiry date of  the
Offers (as they may have been extended) for any reason whatsoever  other than

or, to the extent the Offeror is permitted to waive such  conditions pursuant
to the provisions of Schedule A, waived by the  Offeror; it being understood
that if all of the terms of the extended  Offers have been complied with or
waived by the Offeror, such Securities  shall have been taken up and paid for
before any further extension of the  Offers in accordance with applicable
Canadian securities legislation;  (f) a Termination Fee Event shall have
occurred, provided that no termination  under this Section 8.2(f) shall be
effective unless and until the  Corporation shall have paid to the Offeror
the Termination Fee in  accordance with the terms of Section 9.2; or  (g)
the Offeror shall have breached any of its representations, warranties, 
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement and such breach  is
not curable     -33-    or, if curable, is not cured within 15 days
after written notice of the  breach has been given to the Offeror by the
Corporation.  8.3 TERMINATION BY OFFEROR   The Offeror, when not in
default in the performance of its material obligations under this Agreement,
may, without prejudice to any other rights other than as provided in Section
9.3, terminate its obligations under this Agreement by notice to the
Corporation if:  (a) the Offeror has not taken up and paid for the
Securities on or prior to  the Outside Date;  (b) a Termination Fee Event
shall have occurred;  (c) the Offers shall have expired or have been
withdrawn in accordance with  their terms without the Offeror having

Competition Act Clearance cannot be secured except by divesting or  agreeing
to divest all of the Securities or all or substantially all of  the assets of
the Corporation and its Subsidiaries.  8.4 EFFECT OF TERMINATION   In the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3,
this Agreement (except for (i) Sections 9.2, 9.4, 10.1 and 11.2 and (ii) the
Confidentiality Agreement) shall forthwith become void and cease to have any
force or effect without any liability on the part of either party hereto or
any of its affiliates; provided that nothing in this Section 8.4 shall
relieve either party to this Agreement of liability for any breach of this
Agreement occurring prior to the termination thereof.  9. TERMINATION FEE
EVENT  9.1 TERMINATION FEE EVENT   A "Termination Fee Event" shall occur
if, prior to the Effective Date:  (a) the Board withdraws or modifies in a
manner adverse to the Offeror its  approval or recommendation of the Offers
and makes a public announcement  to that effect;     -34-   (b) the
Board recommends any Superior Proposal and makes a public  announcement to
that effect; or  (c) the Board fails to reaffirm its recommendation of the
Offers by press  release within a reasonable time after the public
announcement or  commencement of any Acquisition Proposal (or in the event
that the Offers  are scheduled to expire, prior to the scheduled expiry of
the Offers);  provided in each case, (i) the Offeror is not in default in
the performance of its material obligations under this Agreement and (ii) for
greater certainty, that none of the events described in Section 8.2(a), (b)
or (e) shall have occurred.  9.2 PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEE   The
Corporation shall pay the Termination Fee to the Offeror if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(f) or 8.3(b), by bank draft or wire
transfer no later than the first Business Day following the Termination Fee
Event.  9.3 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES   In the event the Termination Fee is paid
to the Offeror, no other amounts will be due and payable as damages or
otherwise by the Corporation and the Offeror hereby accepts that the
Termination Fee is in lieu of any damages or any other payment or remedy
which it may be entitled to. The Offeror agrees that the Termination Fee
constitutes payment of liquidated damages which are a genuine anticipated
assessment or estimate of the damages which it will suffer or incur as a
result of the event giving rise to such damages and resulting in the
termination of this Agreement and does not and will not constitute payment of
a penalty.  9.4 ADDITIONAL FEE OBLIGATION   If this Agreement has been
terminated without any payment of the Termination Fee and in circumstances
where (i) the Offeror is not in breach of any or its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements herein in any material respect and
(ii) the Competition Act Clearance has been obtained prior to the termination
and, within four months thereafter, an Acquisition Proposal is consummated
which has a value per Class A Share and per Class B Share greater than the
per Share value attributable thereto under the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Corporation shall forthwith pay to the Offeror an amount
equal to the Termination Fee.  10. FEES AND EXPENSES  10.1 FEES AND
EXPENSES   Except as otherwise provided in section 7.2, each of the Offeror
and the Corporation shall be responsible for and bear all of its own fees,
costs and expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel,
financial advisors, accountants, actuaries, consultants and brokers, expenses
of its advisors, agents and other representatives) incurred at any time
in     -35-   connection with pursuing or consummating this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. The provisions of this Section 10
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  11. GENERAL  11.1
DISCLOSURE   Except as required by applicable laws or regulations or by
any Governmental Entity or in accordance with the requirements of any
stock exchange, no party shall make any public announcement or statement
with respect to this Agreement without the approval of the other which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Moreover, the parties agree to
consult with each other prior to issuing each public announcement or
statement with respect to this Agreement, subject to the overriding
obligations of applicable laws or regulations.  11.2 FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF
DIRECTORS   No provision of this Agreement shall require the Corporation to
cause any of its directors to take any action, or refrain from taking any
action, that is required by such person to fulfill his/her fiduciary legal
obligations as a director of the Corporation, nor, so long as the Corporation
has not breached Section 4.1(e)(i)-(v), 4.2(c), 4.3, 4.4 or 5 of this
Agreement, shall any provision of this Agreement prevent the Board from
considering, negotiating, approving, recommending to its holders of Shares or
other Securities or entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior
Proposal or from approving or recommending such Superior Proposal. For
greater certainty, a modification, change or withdrawal by the Board of its
recommendation of the Offers after the date hereof in the proper exercise of
such fiduciary duty shall not result in the representations in Section 3.2 of
this Agreement being considered to be untrue or incorrect. The foregoing
shall not be interpreted to diminish, limit, restrict or otherwise affect in
any way any covenant or agreement of the Corporation under this Agreement or
be construed as a forgiveness or waiver of any breach.  11.3 CONTROL OF
OTHER PARTY\'S BUSINESS   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Offeror, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Corporation and the Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Date.  11.4 ASSIGNMENT   The Offeror may assign all or any part of its
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Offeror, but, if such assignment takes place, the Offeror shall
continue to be liable jointly and severally (solidarily) with the assignee
for any obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not otherwise be
assignable by either party without the consent of the other.    
-36-   11.5 GOVERNING LAW   This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Quebec and of Canada
applicable therein (without regard to conflict of laws principles).  11.6
SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   The representations and
warranties made by the Corporation shall remain in effect during the term of
this Agreement. No investigations made by or on behalf of the Offeror or any
of its authorized agents at any time shall have the effect of waiving,
diminishing the scope of or otherwise affecting any representation, warranty
or covenant made by the Corporation herein or pursuant hereto.  11.7
AMENDMENTS   This Agreement may not be amended except by written agreement
signed by all of the parties to this Agreement. For greater certainty, the
written agreement of those persons referred to in Section 6.3(c) shall not
be required, except that no amendment to Section 6.3 or relating to a
person\'s rights thereunder may be effected on or after the Effective Date
without such person\'s written agreement.  11.8 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND
OTHER RELIEF   Subject to Section 9.3, it is recognized and acknowledged
that a breach by any party of any material obligations contained in this
Agreement will cause any other party to sustain injury for which they would
not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages. Accordingly, in the
event of any such breach, any aggrieved party shall be entitled to the remedy
of specific performance of such obligations and interlocutory, preliminary
and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other
remedy to which it or they may be entitled, at law or in equity, any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief hereby being
waived.  11.9 COUNTERPARTS   This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts which together shall be deemed to constitute one valid and
binding agreement, and delivery of the counterparts may be effected by means
of telecopier transmission.  11.10 SCHEDULES   Schedules A, B and C hereto
form an integral part of this Agreement.  11.11 ENTIRE AGREEMENT   This
Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement and understanding between the parties pertaining to
the subject matter hereof.     -37-   11.12 TIME   Time shall be of
the essence in this Agreement.  11.13 NOTICES   Any notice, request,
