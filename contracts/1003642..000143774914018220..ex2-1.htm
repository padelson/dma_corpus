---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable (but not later than ninety (90) days

Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Preliminary Cash Determination_
"), (iii) Closing Date Debt (the " _Preliminary Closing Date Debt
Determination_ ") and (iv) Closing Date Transaction Expenses (the "
_Preliminary Closing Date Transaction Expenses Determination_ " and, together
with the Preliminary Working Capital Determination, the Preliminary Cash
Determination and the Preliminary Closing Date Debt Determination, the "
_Preliminary Closing Statement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that until such
time as the calculation of the amounts shown on the Closing Date Working
Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Debt and Closing Date Transaction
Expenses determinations are final and binding on the parties pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_ , the Stockholder Representative and its accountants (at the
Stockholder Representative's expense) shall be permitted to discuss with Buyer
and its accountants the Preliminary Closing Statement and shall be provided
copies of, and have access upon reasonable notice at all reasonable times
during normal business hours to, subject to the Stockholder Representative's
entrance into a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement with
Buyer's accountants (if required thereby), the work papers and supporting
records of Buyer and its accountants so as to allow the Stockholder
Representative and its accountants to become informed concerning all matters
relating to the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement and the
accounting procedures, methodologies, tests and approaches used in connection
therewith.

 



 

(b) Following receipt of the Preliminary Closing Statement, if the
Stockholder Representative has any objections to such document as prepared by
Buyer, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver written notice to Buyer of
such dispute within forty-five (45) days after the date of such receipt
thereof (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). In the event that the Stockholder
Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice within such 45-day period,
the Preliminary Working Capital Determination, Preliminary Cash Determination,
Preliminary Closing Date Debt Determination and Preliminary Closing Date
Transaction Expenses Determination set forth therein shall be final and
binding as the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ," " _Closing Date Working
Capital_ ," " _Closing Date Cash_ ," " _Closing Date Debt_ " and " _Closing
Date Transaction Expenses_ ," respectively, for purposes of this Agreement. In
the event such Dispute Notice is delivered, the Stockholder Representative and
Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute; _provided_ that
any item set forth or reflected on any of the Preliminary Closing Statements
that is not identified as being an item of disagreement in the Dispute Notice
shall become final and binding upon the parties from and after the delivery of
the Dispute Notice. If Buyer and the Stockholder Representative,
notwithstanding such good faith efforts, fail to resolve such dispute within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, then Buyer shall engage
the Arbitrator to conduct a special review of the Stockholder Representative's
objections to the Preliminary Working Capital Determination, Preliminary Cash
Determination, Preliminary Closing Date Debt Determination and/or Preliminary
Closing Date Transaction Expenses Determination, as the case may be, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (such review to be completed no later than
thirty (30) days after the Arbitrator is requested to conduct such special
review), which review shall be performed consistent with the Accounting
Principles and _Exhibit D_. Upon completion of such review, the Arbitrator
shall deliver written notice to the Stockholder Representative and Buyer
setting forth the Arbitrator's resolution of such objections and the resulting
adjustments shall be deemed finally determined for purposes of this _Section
_ _2.3_. The Arbitrator's role in completing such review shall be limited to
resolving such objections and determining the correct calculations to be used
with respect to only the disputed portions of the Preliminary Closing
Statement. In resolving such objections, the Arbitrator shall apply the
provisions of this Agreement concerning determination of the amounts set forth
in the Preliminary Closing Statement, and the decision of the Arbitrator shall
be solely based on (i) whether such item objected to was prepared in
accordance with the guidelines set forth in this Agreement concerning
determination of the amounts set forth therein or (ii) whether the item
objected to contains a mathematical or clerical error. The parties agree that
the Arbitrator may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. The Preliminary Working Capital Determination,
Preliminary Cash Determination, Preliminary Closing Date Debt Determination
and Preliminary Closing Date Transaction Expenses Determination as agreed by
Buyer and the Stockholder Representative or as determined by the Arbitrator,
as the case may be, shall be final and binding as the " _Closing Date Working
Capital_ ," " _Closing Date Cash_ ," " _Closing Date Debt_ ," and " _Closing
Date Transaction Expenses_ ," respectively, for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) The parties hereto shall make available to the Arbitrator (if
applicable), such books, records and other information (including work papers)
that the Arbitrator may reasonably request in order to review the Preliminary
Closing Statement. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator hereunder shall be
paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf
of Sellers), on the other hand, based on the percentage which the portion of
the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by or on behalf of such party.

Section 5.4 __

 |  

 _Financial Statements_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) _Schedule 5.4_ contains copies of the audited combined balance
sheets of the Acquired Companies as of December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and
the audited combined statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
of the Acquired Companies, together with the notes thereto, for the years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (collectively, the " _Audited Financial
Statements_ ") together with the auditors' reports thereon, and (ii) the
unaudited combined balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of June 30, 2014
(the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ") and the related unaudited combined statements
of income and cash flows for the six (6) month period ended June 30, 2014
(collectively, the " _Interim Financial Statements_ " and, together with the
Audited Financial Statements, the " _Financial Statements_ "). Except as set
forth therein, the Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity, in
all material respects, with GAAP and present fairly in accordance with GAAP,
in all material respects, the combined financial position, results of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Acquired Companies, as
of their respective dates and for the respective periods covered thereby,
subject, in the case of the Interim Financial Statements, to normal year-end
adjustments and the absence of notes, which are not material in nature and
amount.

 



 

(b) The Acquired Companies do not have any Liabilities required by GAAP to
be reflected on the balance sheet (including the notes thereto) of the
Acquired Companies, except for Liabilities (i) reflected or reserved against
in the Interim Financial Statements, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of
business since the Balance Sheet Date (consistent with past practice), (iii)
expressly contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Acquired
Companies.

 



 

(c) The Acquired Companies maintain systems of internal controls and
procedures concerning financial reporting sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, including
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that:
(i) transactions are executed only in accordance with management's and
directors' general or specific authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements of the Acquired
Companies in conformity with GAAP and maintain accountability for assets and
such records are maintained in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Acquired
Companies and (iii) the recorded accountability for assets (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, includes the prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Assets of the Acquired
Companies that could have a material effect on the Acquired Companies'
respective financial statements) is maintained at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. There are no
significant deficiencies (as such term is defined in Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act of 1933) in the Acquired Companies' internal controls likely to
adversely affect the Acquired Companies' ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information. To the Knowledge of Sellers, since January
1, 2011, there has not been any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees of the Acquired Companies who have a significant
role in its internal controls over financial reporting. None of the Acquired
Companies is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint
venture, off balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any
Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between
any of the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934)), where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, any of the Acquired Companies in the
Acquired Companies' financial statements.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.5 ___________Operations Since Balance Sheet Date_. Except as set
forth in _Schedule 5.5_, from the Balance Sheet Date there have been no
events, changes, circumstances, developments or occurrences which,
individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expect to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.5_, since
the Balance Sheet Date, the Acquired Companies have conducted their business
in all material respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since the Balance Sheet Date
through the date hereof, except as set forth in _Schedule 5.5_, none of the
Acquired Companies has taken any action which, if taken after the date hereof
and prior to the Closing, would require the consent of Buyer pursuant to
_Section 7.4_.

(a) All material Tax Returns required to have been filed by or on behalf

filed prior to the date hereof, each of Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Companies, on the other hand, shall cooperate with each other and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to file required Notification and Report Forms
under the HSR Act with the FTC and DOJ as soon as practicable following the

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the
proviso below in this paragraph, Buyer agrees to take any and all steps and to
make any and all undertakings necessary, including pursuing and defending
against any Proceedings, to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade regulation Requirements of

Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including

separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition
of such assets or businesses of Buyer (or its subsidiaries or other
Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies) or
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit Buyer's freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Buyer (or its subsidiaries or other Affiliates,
including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies), in each case, as
may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any
Proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (i) Buyer, its subsidiaries and other Affiliates
shall not be required to take any action in connection with, or agree to, any
hold separate order, sale, divestitures or disposition or license of its

business of the Acquired Companies relating to that Product, and if it has
made such an election, Buyer will not have any obligation to hold separate,
sell divest, license or otherwise dispose of the Acquired Companies'
comparable Product but shall be obligated to divest, license or otherwise
dispose of such Buyer assets or program, _provided_ , that, for determining
compliance under clause (ii) in the preceding sentence, the comparable product
of the Acquired Companies will be deemed to have been held separate, divested,
licensed or otherwise disposed. None of the Sellers, the Company nor any of
their respective Affiliates or representatives shall make any offer, counter-
offer, or otherwise engage in negotiations with any Governmental Body with

Section 7.7 __ _Benefits_.

"), in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, from each Person whom such
Company and/or Buyer reasonably believe is, with respect to such Company, a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to
the initiation of the requisite shareholder approval procedure under _Section
7.7(b)_ , and whom such Company and/or Buyer reasonably believe might

to take such actions, each Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to

required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code so as to render the
parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code inapplicable to any
and all payments and/or benefits provided pursuant to contracts or
arrangements that, in the absence of the executed Parachute Payment Waivers by
the affected Persons under _Section 7.7(a)_ above, might otherwise result,

provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by reason of Section
280G of the Code, with such stockholder approval to be obtained in a manner
which satisfies all applicable requirements of such Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section
1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations. To extent the Companies or Buyer
determines it is reasonably necessary to take such actions as described above,
each Company shall forward to Buyer, and allow Buyer to review and comment
upon, prior to submission to the shareholders of such Company, copies of all
material documents prepared for purposes of complying with this provision and
shall consider any such comments in good faith.

Agreement, whether express or implied, shall, (i) constitute an amendment to

hereto with respect to any employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement
or arrangement of the Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates, (iii)

Section 7.8 __

 |  

 _Financing_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) Buyer hereby acknowledges that the receipt of the Debt Financing (or
any alternative financing) is not a condition to their obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges
that the failure to consummate the Closing because they have not obtained the
Debt Financing would be a willful and material breach of this Agreement. Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the
"flex" provisions) as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the applicable Debt
Commitment Letter pursuant to its terms, (ii) comply with its obligations
under the applicable Debt Commitment Letter and any definitive agreements
relating thereto (the " _Debt Financing Documents_ "), (iii) negotiate and
(subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 9.1_ and
_9.3_ ) enter into the applicable Debt Financing Documents on a timely basis
on terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained therein or
otherwise not less favorable to Buyer in the aggregate that those contained in
the applicable Debt Commitment Letter or Alternative Debt Commitment Letter,
(iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer in the
applicable Debt Financing Documents that are within its control (other than,
for the avoidance of doubt, any condition where the failure to be so satisfied
is a direct result of the failure by the Companies or the Sellers to furnish
information required to be delivered pursuant to _Section _ _7.8(c)_ or
otherwise comply with their respective obligations hereunder), (v) enforce all
of its rights under or with respect to the applicable Debt Financing Documents
and (vi) consummate the applicable Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing
Date. Buyer shall keep the Stockholder Representative and the Companies
informed on a reasonable basis and in reasonable detail, upon request, of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (including providing, upon
request, the Stockholder Representative and the Companies with copies of all
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing). Buyer shall give the
Stockholder Representative and the Companies prompt notice upon having
knowledge of any material breach by any party of any of the Debt Financing
Documents or any termination of any of the Debt Financing Documents or any
event, circumstance or development that makes the consummation of the Debt
Financing materially less likely to occur. Other than as set forth in _Section
7.8(b)_ , Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder Representative, amend, modify, supplement or waive any of the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Documents or any
other provision of, or remedies under, the Debt Financing Documents, in each
case to the extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of (A) reducing the aggregate amount
of Debt Financing to an amount below the amount required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) making the funding of the
Debt Financing less likely to occur, (C) amending, modifying, supplementing or
waiving the conditions or contingencies to the Debt Financing (including
imposing additional conditions or contingencies) in a manner that could have
the effect of preventing, impeding, adversely affecting the likelihood of or
delaying the Closing, (D) adversely affecting Buyer's rights against the
lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof or (E)
adversely affecting the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the End Date; _provided_ that, subject
to the foregoing, the Debt Commitment Letter may be amended to include
additional commitment parties thereto, it being understood and agreed that the
Debt Commitment Letter may be amended to include the Persons previously
identified by Buyer to the Sellers. Anything to the contrary herein
notwithstanding, in no event will Buyer be under any obligation to disclose
any information that is subject to any applicable legal privilege (including
the attorney-client privilege).

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to promptly obtain the Debt
Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from alternative sources, in
an amount sufficient, when added to available cash and marketable securities,
available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds, and
any portion of the Debt Financing that is available, to pay in cash all
amounts required to be paid by Buyer in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (" _Alternative Debt Financing_ "), including
obtaining a new financing commitment letter (the " _Alternative Debt
Commitment Letter_ ") and a new definitive agreement with respect thereto that
provides for such financing on terms not less favorable, (as reasonably
determined by Buyer), in the aggregate, to Buyer than the terms contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof and with lenders reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer. In such event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Debt Financing, and
the term "Debt Commitment Letter" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include any Alternative Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, each of the Companies shall, and shall cause the
Companies' Subsidiaries to, use its and their respective commercially
reasonable efforts, and to use its and their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause its and their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, investment bankers, legal counsel, agents and other advisors and
representatives (collectively, the " _Advisors_ ") to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to provide all reasonable customary
cooperation in connection with the arrangement, syndication and consummation
of the Debt Financing or any permitted replacement, amendment or modification
thereof or any Alternative Debt Financing for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Available Financing_ "), including
providing information regarding the Companies required by regulatory
authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act that is requested by
Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and using
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) participate in a reasonable number of
meetings (including one-on-one meetings or conference calls with the parties
acting as agents or arrangers for, and prospective lenders of, the Debt
Financing, and senior management and the employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other Advisors of the Companies), lender
presentations, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with
prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies and other syndication

to the Available Financing; (ii) furnish Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources,
as promptly as reasonably practicable, with the financial statements set forth
in item 4 on Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letter; (iii) assist Buyer and
its Debt Financing Sources in the preparation of (A) any syndication documents
and materials, including information memoranda, lender presentations and other
marketing documents customarily used to arrange financing similar to the

materials for rating agency presentations; (v) furnish Buyer and the Debt
Financing Sources with customary authorization letters with respect to the
presence or absence of material non-public information and accuracy of the
information contained therein to be included in the Marketing Documentation
and cooperate with the marketing efforts of Buyer and the Debt Financing
Sources for any portion of the Available Financing; (v) assist in the
negotiation of and assisting in the preparation of any credit or other
agreements, pledge or security documents, or other certificates or documents,
and the respective schedules and exhibits thereto, in connection with the
Available Financing; (vi) cooperate with Buyer's legal counsel in connection
with any legal opinions that such legal counsel may be required to deliver in
connection with the Available Financing; (vii) assist Buyer in obtaining
surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Buyer _provided_ ,
_however_ , there shall be no obligation to deliver an indemnity to obtain a
non-imputation endorsement; (viii) facilitate the obtaining of (A) audit
reports and consents of accountants and auditors with respect to financial
statements and other financial information for the Companies for inclusion in
any Marketing Documentation and (B) pay-off letters, control agreement

releases, hedge terminations, lien terminations and other similar terminations
or releases, in each case as reasonably requested by Buyer and customary for
financings similar to the Available Financing; (ix) otherwise reasonably
facilitate the granting of a security interest (and perfection thereof) in
collateral (including assisting with the drafting of disclosure schedules and
perfection certificates and providing original copies of all certificated
securities with transfer powers executed in blank); and (x) provide financial
statements (including monthly financial statements) in the form and to the
extent provided internally to senior management of the Companies as promptly
as practicable (but in no event less than five (5) Business Days) after
providing such financial statements internally to senior management of the
Companies; _provided_ , that none of the Sellers or the Companies shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Available Financing that would be effective
prior to the Closing; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the effectiveness of
any documentation (other than customary authorization and representation
letters) executed by any Company with respect thereto shall be subject to the
consummation of the Closing. The Companies shall not be required to take any
action hereunder that unreasonably interferes with the operation of their
business. Any information provided to Buyer or any other Person pursuant to
this _Section 7.8(c)_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.
Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, if to the Knowledge of Sellers
any information specifically provided by any of the Acquired Companies to
Buyer in connection with the Debt Financing (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include the Schedules or any projections, forecasts or
forward-looking information) contains any misstatement of any material fact,
the Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer
such information as may be necessary to correct such information. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that none of the Sellers nor any Company nor any of
their respective Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, representatives and advisors (including legal, financial and
accounting advisors) shall have any responsibility for, or incur any liability
to any person under or in connection with, the arrangement of the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing that Buyer may raise in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative, the Sellers, the
Companies and their respective Affiliates and directors, officers, employees,
representatives and advisors (including legal, financial and accounting
advisors) from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them
solely and directly in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
or any Alternative Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than (i) information provided by the Sellers or the Companies
expressly for use in connection therewith or (ii) to the extent arising from
the willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or bad faith of any of the
Sellers or the Companies). Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
promptly, upon written request, reimburse the Companies for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the Companies in
connection with providing financing cooperation provided for assistance
requested by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 7.8(c)_. The Companies hereby
consent to the use of their logos in connection with the Available Financing;
_provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that does not violate
any existing contractual obligation of the Companies and does not harm or
disparage the Companies or their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the condition set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_ , as it applies to the
obligations of the Acquired Companies under this _Section 7.8(c)_ , shall be
deemed satisfied unless the Debt Financing has not been obtained primarily as
a result of the willful and material breach by the Companies of their
obligations under this _Section 7.8(c)_.

Section 8.1 __

 |  

 _Tax Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) _Liability for Taxes_.

 



 

(i) Sellers shall be liable for and pay, and each Seller (jointly and
severally and pro rata in accordance with their Aggregate Percentage
Interests) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from
and against, (x) any and all Taxes and associated Losses imposed on any of the
Acquired Companies for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the
Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and (y) any and all
Taxes and associated Losses imposed on any of the Acquired Companies, or for
which any of the Acquired Companies may otherwise be liable, as a result of
being or having been a member of any "affiliated group" (as defined in Section
1504(a) of the Code without regard to the limitations contained in Section
1504(b) of the Code but taking into account the provisions of Section 1504(c)
of the Code, as relevant) that, at any time on or before the Closing Date,
includes or has included any of the Acquired Companies, or any other group of
corporations filing Tax Returns on a combined, consolidated, unitary or
similar basis that, at any time on or before the Closing Date, includes or has
included any of the Acquired Companies (a " _Company Group_ ") (including
Taxes for which any of the Acquired Companies may be liable pursuant to
Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state, local or
foreign law as a result of being or having been a member of a Company Group);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall not be liable for or pay, and
shall not indemnify or hold harmless any Buyer Group Member from and against,
(A) any Taxes shown as a liability or reserve on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and included in Closing Date Working Capital, (B) any Taxes imposed on
any of the Acquired Companies or for which any of the Acquired Companies may
otherwise be liable as a result of non-ordinary course transactions occurring
on the Closing Date that are properly allocable to the portion of the Closing
Date after the Closing, and (C) any Taxes that result from any actual or
deemed election by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer under Section 338 of the
Code or any similar provisions of U.S. state, local or non U.S. law as a
result of the purchase of the Shares (Taxes described in this proviso,
hereinafter " _Excluded Taxes_ "). Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of
(or credit for) Taxes allocable to any taxable year or period that ends on or
before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and which
Taxes are indemnifiable pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)_ other than refunds
taken into account as an asset in Closing Date Working Capital; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any refund created by a Transaction Tax Deduction paid to
Seller hereunder shall reduce dollar-for-dollar the $5 million limitation in
_Section 8.1(a)(vi)_. Upon the request of the Stockholder Representative,
Buyer shall file (or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns (including amended Tax
Returns) or other documents claiming any refunds or credits to which Sellers
are entitled pursuant to the preceding sentence. Buyer shall inform the
Stockholder Representative promptly after the end of each calendar year as to
whether such refund or credit is, or with the taking of action would be,
available.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(ii) Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Seller Group Member from and against, (A) any and all Taxes
imposed on any of the Acquired Companies, or for which any of the Acquired
Companies may otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that begins
after the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion
of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date and (B) Excluded
Taxes.

 



 

(iii) For purposes of _Sections _ _8.1(a)(i)_ and _(a)_ _(ii)_ , whenever
it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Acquired Companies
for a Straddle Period, the determination of such Taxes for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that
the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended
at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of
the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss
or credit of the Acquired Companies or with respect to the Shares for the
Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods
on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Acquired
Companies were closed at the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that (x) transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly
allocable to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing shall be
allocated to the taxable year or period that is deemed to begin at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date and (y) exemptions, allowances
or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction
for depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or
periods on a daily basis.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any real property
transfer or gains Tax, sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or
other similar Tax imposed on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers.

 



 

(v) " _Transaction Tax Deductions_ " means any and all U.S. federal and
state income tax deductions (if any) related to (A) any bonuses paid on or
prior to the Closing Date to any employee of the Companies or their
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (B)
expenses with respect to Indebtedness being paid in connection with the
Closing, (C) all transaction expenses and payments that are deductible for Tax
purposes, including Transaction Expenses and other fees and expenses of legal
counsel, accountants, investment bankers and the Stockholder Representative
incurred by the Companies in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (D) the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.5_, (E) any
disbursement of all or any portion of the Escrow Fund to Sellers in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement and (F) any disbursement of all or any portion of
the Expense Reserve to Sellers in accordance with _Section 12.5_. Transaction
Tax Deductions shall be claimed in a taxable year or period (or portion of any
Straddle Period) ending on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent
consistent with the Tax Standard. To the extent Transaction Tax Deductions are
not fully utilized in such period, the applicable Company shall elect to carry
back any items of loss, deduction or credit from any Transaction Tax Deduction
to prior taxable years to the extent consistent with the Tax Standard.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(vi) To the extent any Transaction Tax Deduction results in a reduction of
the federal or state income, or similar Taxes of the Acquired Companies,
Buyer, any Affiliate of or successor to any of the foregoing, or any member of
a consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of which any of the
foregoing is a member (collectively, the " _Buyer Tax Group_ ") for any
taxable year including the Closing Date and the subsequent three (3) taxable
years (each such reduction, a " _Tax Reduction_ "), then Buyer shall pay to
Sellers, pro rata in accordance with their Aggregate Percentage Interests, an
amount equal to such Tax Reduction promptly after filing the Tax Return
applicable to such taxable year; provided, however, that Buyer's liability to
pay Sellers in respect of Tax Reductions under this Section 8.1(a)(vi)(A)
shall not exceed $5 million in the aggregate. For purposes of this _Section
8.1(a)(vi)(A)_, the amount of any Tax Reduction shall be determined only after
taking into account all other applicable items of income, gain, deduction or
loss (or any other Tax attributes (other than Transaction Tax Deductions)) of
the Buyer Tax Group. Buyer shall claim, and shall cause the other members of
the Buyer Tax Group to claim, a deduction or similar Tax item with respect to
a Transaction Tax Deduction in good faith in accordance with the internal
policies of, and consistent with the tax accounting methods established with
the relevant Tax authorities by, the Buyer Tax Group for claiming deductions
with respect to comparable items of the Buyer Tax Group (or if no comparable
items exist, if such position is "more likely than not" to be accepted) (the
foregoing, the " _Tax Standard_ "). Payment of any Tax Reduction shall be made
promptly after filing the Tax Return (after taking into account extensions)
for the taxable year or period in which the Tax Reduction in question occurs
or is claimed, without interest of any kind. Upon reasonable request of
Stockholder Representative, Buyer shall inform Stockholder Representative of
the amount of Transaction Tax Deductions used in the most recently filed Tax
Return, and the basis for its determination of that amount. Nothing in this
_Section 8.1(a)(vi)_ shall require the Buyer to disclose any Tax information
it reasonably considers to be confidential.

 



 

(b) _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) Buyer shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Acquired Companies after the
Closing Date, and Buyer shall remit, or cause to be remitted, any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to Tax Returns to be filed by Buyer
pursuant to the preceding sentence that relate to taxable years or periods
ending on or before the Closing Date and any Straddle Period (x) such Tax
Returns shall be filed in a manner reasonably consistent with past practice
and _Section 8.1(a)(v)_ and no position shall be taken, election made or
method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or
methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns (including any such
position, election or method which would have the effect of accelerating
income to periods for which Sellers are liable or deferring deductions to
periods for which Buyer is liable) to the extent permitted by applicable law
and (y) such Tax Returns with respect to any Taxable year or period ending on
or prior to or including the Closing Date shall be submitted to the
Stockholder Representative not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is within forty-five
(45) days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date) for review and approval by the Stockholder Representative, which
approval may not be unreasonably withheld, but may in all cases be withheld if
such Tax Returns were not prepared in accordance with clause (x) of this
sentence. Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, shall pay the
other party for the Taxes for which Sellers or Buyer, respectively, are or is
liable pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_ but which are payable with any Tax Return
to be filed by the other party pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ upon the
written request of the party entitled to payment, setting forth in detail the
computation of the amount owed by Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, but in
no event earlier than ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date for paying
such Taxes.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(ii) None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or
permit the Acquired Companies to) make or change any Tax election, file in any
jurisdiction not previously filed in, amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or
grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax
Return or other filing in respect of Taxes relating in whole or in part to the
Acquired Companies with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or
before the Closing Date (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without the
prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, unless any such
action shall not have any adverse Tax consequence to the Sellers or unless
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers from any increased Tax
liability resulting therefrom.

 



 

(c) _Contest Provisions_.

 



 

(i) Buyer shall promptly notify the Stockholder Representative in writing
upon receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of the Acquired Companies
of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits, examinations or assessments which might affect the Tax liabilities for
which Sellers may be liable pursuant to this _Section 8.1_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to give notice as provided in this _Section
8.1(c)(i)_ shall not affect Buyer's right to indemnification under this
Agreement except to the extent Sellers shall have been prejudiced by such
failure.

 



 

(ii) The Stockholder Representative shall have the sole right to represent
the Acquired Companies' interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date or
otherwise relating to Taxes for which Sellers may be liable pursuant to this
_Section 8.1_ , and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. In the
case of a Straddle Period, the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to
participate at its expense in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes attributable to the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date. None of
Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of the Acquired Companies may settle any
Tax claim for any Taxes for which Sellers may be liable pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)_ , without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of Sellers) and Buyer shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to):

 



 

(i) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other
party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _Section
8.1(b)_ ;

 



 

(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with
taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies;

 



 

(iii) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as
reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes
of the Acquired Companies;

 



 

(iv) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessments of the Acquired Companies for taxable
periods for which the other may have a liability under this _Section 8.1_ ;

 



 

(v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any such taxable period;

 



 

(vi) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be
necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce),
or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in
_Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes); and

 



 

(vii) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar
authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of this _Section 8.1_.

predecessors), as provided in (i) the Organizational Documents of any of the

and be honored by the Acquired Companies after the Closing.

 



 

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall, or shall cause the

which it transacts business, (ii) shall not adopt a plan of complete or
partial liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, restructuring,

the effectuation of such actions such Seller shall be permitted to take such
action if it substitutes an entity reasonably acceptable to Buyer to assume

such obligations. GP is a limited liability company that has been duly formed

and perform its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by GP and represents (assuming the valid
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by each other party
hereto) the legal, valid and binding obligation of GP, enforceable against GP

Representative in accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.3_ on or
prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance
with this _Section 11.1(c)_ , as to which the obligation of Sellers shall

_Article XI_ , and Sellers shall have reimbursed all Buyer Indemnified Parties

Section 11.3 __

 |  

 _Direct Claims_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) Other than with respect to a Third Person Claim, any party hereto
seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall deliver
to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party
(the " _Indemnitor_ ") a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ "), which shall be
delivered promptly after the Indemnified Party acquires actual knowledge of
the basis for a claim for indemnification hereunder and which shall describe
in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such claim, and shall include in
such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount, or the method of computation of
the amount, of such claim and a reference to the provision of this Agreement
or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in
connection herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to provide a Claim Notice
promptly to the Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been materially and
actually prejudiced by such failure.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) After the timely delivery of any Claim Notice pursuant to _Section
11.3(a)_ , the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall
be entitled under this _Article _ _XI_ shall be determined (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall
have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses
suffered by it.

 



      |  

Section 11.4 __

 |  

 _Third Person Claims_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) Any party seeking indemnification provided for under this Agreement in
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any third
Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Person Claim_ ") shall notify
the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Person Claim
within fifteen (15) Business Days (or reasonably more promptly dependent upon
the circumstances) after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice
of such Third Person Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Indemnitor, within ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnified Party's
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnitor relating to such Third Person Claim (a " _Third
Person Claim Notice_ "). Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement shall
refer to the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is based and
describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known) the facts giving rise to
an alleged basis for the claim and the amount of the liability asserted
against the Indemnitor by reason of such Third Person Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to give notice
to the Indemnitor as provided in this _Section 11.4_ shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor
shall have been materially and actually prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnitor shall have fifteen (15) Business Days (or such lesser number of
days as set forth in the Third Person Claim Notice as may be required by court
proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Third
Person Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party
that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Person
Claim.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party within
the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a
Third Person Claim, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and absolute right
after the receipt of notice, at its option and at its own expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice and to control, defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Person Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in any such Proceeding
with counsel of its choice and at its expense; _provided_ _further_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume or continue
control of the defense of any Third Person Claim if (i) the Third Person Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or regulatory Proceeding,
(ii) based on the advice of outside legal counsel to the Indemnified Party, a
conflict (including the availability of different or additional defenses)
exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor in connection with
such Third Person Claim or conduct of claim by the Indemnitor would compromise
any legal privilege or similar doctrine with respect to the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates or (iii) the Third Person Claim primarily seeks (x)
an injunction against the Indemnified Party or (y) where the Indemnified Party
is a Buyer Indemnified Party, equitable relief requiring the taking of action
or the refraining from taking actions by the Buyer. The Indemnified Party
agrees to cooperate fully and in good faith with the Indemnitor in connection
with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third Person Claim. To the
extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such Third Person Claim by written
notice to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel at
the expense of the Indemnitor, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such Proceeding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnitor shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section
_ _11.4_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in
addition to any local counsel who may need to be retained. The Indemnitor
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third Person Claim on a basis
that would not include an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and
would (i) exceed the balance of the Indemnitor's indemnity obligations
hereunder if the Indemnified Party is a Seller Group Member, or exceed the
Indemnity Escrow, if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party, (ii)
result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would
restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, (iii) result in a finding or admission of a violation of
Requirements of Laws or violation of the rights of any Person by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) impose ongoing obligations
on the Indemnified Party following the date of such settlement or compromise.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) If the Indemnitor (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Person Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise or (ii) after assuming
the defense of a Third Person Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary
to defend diligently such Third Person Claim within ten (10) days after
receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the
Indemnitor has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not
the obligation to assume its own defense; it being understood that the
Indemnified Party's right to indemnification for a Third Person Claim shall
not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Person Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Person Claim seeking money
damages without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 11.4(e)_ , the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor shall reasonably cooperate in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense of a Third Person Claim, including by providing access to
each other's relevant business records and other documents and employees; it
being understood that the reasonable costs and expenses of the Indemnified
Party relating thereto shall constitute Losses.

 



 

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production or other disclosure of confidential information
(consistent with applicable Requirements of Laws), and to cause all
communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a
Third Person Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client
or work-product privileges.

 



 

(f) To the extent of any inconsistency between this _Section 11.4_ and
_Section _ _8.1(c)_ (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of _Section
8.1(c)_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

Section 11.5 __

 |  

 _Determination of Indemnification Amounts_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_Article _ _XI_ , Losses and Expenses recoverable under this _Article XI_
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements actually
received (net of costs of enforcement, deductibles and retro-premium
adjustments) by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates in connection
with such Losses or Expenses or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto.
The calculation of Losses and Expenses shall not include losses arising
because of a change after the Closing in applicable Requirements of Law or
accounting principle.

 



 

(b) Any indemnification payment under this Agreement shall be treated for
Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



 

(c) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has
indemnified it pursuant to this _Article XI_ , such Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the full amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by it in
procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor in
pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter; _provided_ that no
Indemnified Party shall be required to seek or collect such recoveries prior
to being entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable steps to mitigate
their respective Losses and Expenses upon and after becoming aware of any
event or condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses and Expenses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

 



 

(e) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 11.1_ to the extent the matter in
question was actually taken into account in the computation of the Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_.

 



 

(f) In connection with the matters covered by this _Article XI_ , no
holder of any Equity Interest of the Sellers or the Acquired Companies shall
have (i) any right to indemnity or contribution from the Acquired Companies or
(ii) any right of subrogation against the Acquired Companies with respect to
any indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Party by reason of any
indemnification provided in _Section 11.1_ , it being agreed and acknowledged
that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Acquired
Companies herein are solely for the benefit of the Buyer and Buyer Indemnified
Parties.

 



 

(g) The representation, warranties and covenants of the Indemnitor, and
the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall
not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its representatives) or
by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of its representatives
knew or should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or
might be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of any
condition set forth in _Article IX_.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 11.6 __ __ __ __ _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, each Seller, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the
Closing, except in the case of fraud and except for the equitable remedies
expressly contemplated in _Section 13.14_ , its sole and exclusive remedy
against the other party and its respective Affiliates, including for the
Losses and Expenses of any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Group Member, as
applicable, relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of whether such
claims arise in contract, tort, breach of warranty or any other legal or
equitable theory, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article XI_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may
otherwise have or to which they may become entitled. In furtherance of the
foregoing, without waiving the express provisions of this Agreement, including
the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article XI_ , (a) Buyer
hereby waives, from and after the Closing Date, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action any Buyer Indemnified Party may have against any Seller or
its respective Affiliates or their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or representatives, successors or
assigns and (b) the Sellers hereby waive, from and after the Closing Date, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action any Seller Group Member may have

successors or assigns.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Applicable Survival Period_. It is the express intent of
the parties that, if the applicable survival period for an item as
contemplated by this Article XI is shorter or longer than the statute of
limitations that would otherwise have been applicable to such item, then, by
contract, the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such item
shall be reduced or extended to the shortened or lengthened survival period
contemplated hereby. The parties further acknowledge that the time periods set
forth in this Article XI for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are
the result of arms-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend
for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

Price actually received by such Seller or (B) disproportionately adversely
affect the rights or obligations of any class of Sellers without similarly

notwithstanding _Section _ _12.1_ , at the request of the Stockholder
Representative, such Seller shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including delivery of such
Seller's Shares and acceptance of the Purchase Price therefor) individually on
such Seller's own behalf, and delivery of any other documents required of
Sellers pursuant to the terms hereof.

 



 

Section 12.3 _______Liability of Stockholder_ ___Representative_. The
Stockholder Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or
omitted by it hereunder or under any other document contemplated hereby, or in
connection therewith, except that the Stockholder Representative shall not be
relieved of any liability imposed by Requirements of Law for gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to
any Seller for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in
good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Seller to
which payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from the other
Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to
have been entitled. The Stockholder Representative shall not be required to
make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the
terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Each Seller acknowledges
and agrees that the Stockholder Representative shall not be obligated to take
any actions and shall be entitled to take such actions as the Stockholder
Representative deems appropriate in its sole discretion. Each Seller further
agrees to indemnify and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless from and
against any loss, liability or expense arising in connection with any act or
omission as the Stockholder Representative, except for any liability imposed
by Requirements of Law for gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 



 

Section 12.4 _____Reliance by Buyer_. Each Seller agrees that Buyer shall
be entitled to unconditionally assume that any action taken or omitted, or any
document executed by, RT Partners purporting to act as the Stockholder
Representative under or pursuant to this Agreement or any Seller Ancillary
Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Seller Ancillary Agreement has been unconditionally
authorized by Sellers to be taken, omitted to be taken, or executed on their
behalf so that they will be legally bound thereby, and each Seller agrees not
to institute any claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding against Buyer
alleging that RT Partners did not have the authority to act as the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of Sellers in connection with any such action,
omission or execution. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this
_Article XII_ shall in no way impose any obligations on Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. In particular, notwithstanding any notice received by Buyer or its
Affiliates to the contrary, Buyer and its Affiliates shall be fully protected
in relying upon and shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall have no
Liability to any Seller with respect to actions, decisions or determinations
of the Stockholder Representative. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled
to assume that all actions, decisions and determinations of the Stockholder
Representative are fully authorized. No modification or revocation of the
power of attorney granted by Sellers herein to RT Partners to serve as the
Stockholder Representative shall be effective as against Buyer until Buyer has
received a document signed by each Seller effecting said modification or
revocation.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 12.5 _____Expense Reserve_. Each Seller hereby acknowledges and
agrees that $2,000,000 (the " _Expense Reserve_ ") shall be withheld and paid
directly to an account maintained by the Stockholder Representative (or a
financial institution selected by the Stockholder Representative) as a fund
for the fees and expenses (including any legal fees and expenses) of, and
other amounts payable by, the Stockholder Representative in connection with
this Agreement. Any balance of the Expense Reserve not utilized for such
purposes shall be paid, when deemed appropriate by the Stockholder
Representative in its sole discretion, to Sellers in accordance with their
Aggregate Percentage Interests by the Stockholder Representative. In the event
that the Expense Reserve shall be insufficient to satisfy the fees and
expenses of, and other amounts payable by, the Stockholder Representative, and
in the event there are any remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow finally
determined to be distributed to Sellers immediately prior to the final
distribution from the Indemnity Escrow to Sellers pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Representative shall
be entitled to recover any such expenses from the Indemnity Escrow to the
extent of such funds prior to such distribution of funds to Sellers. The
Stockholder Representative shall also be entitled to recover any remaining
expenses or other amounts directly from Sellers, and, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Stockholder Representative shall not have any obligation to
personally advance funds in connection with the performance of any of its
duties under this Agreement.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 



 

Section 13.1 __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ _Confidential Nature of
Information_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms following the date hereof and following the Closing. From the
Closing Date until the sixth (6th) anniversary thereof, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its
other Affiliates and each of their representatives to, treat as confidential
and shall safeguard any and all information, know-how, knowledge and data
(other than historical financial reporting information and information owned
or controlled by Seller after the Closing) relating to the Acquired Companies
(the " _Acquired Confidential Information_ "), in each case in their
respective possession by using the same degree of care, but no less than a
reasonable standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or
disclosure of such information, know-how, knowledge and data as Seller and its
Affiliates used with respect thereto prior to the date hereof. From the
Closing Date until the sixth (6th) anniversary thereof, Buyer and the Acquired
Companies shall, and shall cause each of their representatives to, treat as
confidential and shall safeguard any and all information, know-how, knowledge
and data (other than historical financial reporting information) relating to
Seller's business (other than business of the Acquired Companies) (the "
_Retained Confidential Information_ ") in their respective possession by using
the same degree of care, but not less than a reasonable standard of care, to
prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure of such information,
know-how, knowledge and data as Buyer uses with respect to the Acquired
Confidential Information. Prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, the parties agree that each of them and their respective Subsidiaries
and representatives may only disclose, in the case of Seller and its
Affiliates, Acquired Confidential Information or, in the case of Buyer and its
Affiliates, Retained Confidential Information, as the case may be, (i) to the
extent counsel to such Person advises that disclosure is required to comply
with Requirements of Law ( _provided_ that such party shall provide prior
written notice to Seller or Buyer, as applicable, of such disclosure, unless
prohibited by Requirements of Law, as promptly as practical and shall seek to
limit any such disclosure and to protect from public disclosure by way of a
protective order or otherwise, in each case, to the extent permitted by
Requirements of Law), and (ii) to its representatives who reasonably need to
know such information for purposes of this Agreement or any agreement
ancillary hereto ( _provided_ that each party shall instruct any such
representative to keep such information confidential in accordance with this
Agreement). In no event shall Seller use, or permit any other Person to use,
the Acquired Confidential Information for any purpose other than as expressly
contemplated under this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto. In no
event shall Buyer use, or permit any other Person to use, the Retained
Confidential Information for any purpose other than as expressly contemplated
under this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto. The parties
acknowledge that the confidentiality obligations set forth in this _Section
13.1_ shall not extend to information, knowledge and data that (x) is or
becomes publicly available through no act or omission of a party owing a
confidentiality obligation imposed by this _Section 13.1_ in respect of such
information, knowledge and data (a " _Receiving Party_ "), (y) is or becomes
available to a Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other
than the party to which such information, knowledge and data relates;
_provided_ , that the source of such information, knowledge and data was not
known to the Receiving Party to be bound by confidentiality obligations to the
party to which such information, knowledge and data relates, or (z) the
Receiving Party can establish that it independently developed such
information, knowledge and data without reference to information, knowledge
and data provided to such Receiving Party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and, in the case of Seller, its Affiliates and each of
their representatives, without reference to any Acquired Confidential
Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the obligations
set forth in this _Section 13.1_ with respect to Acquired Confidential
Information that constitute Trade Secrets included in the Company Intellectual
Property shall survive in perpetuity, subject to the exceptions set forth in
clauses (x), (y) and (z) in the prior sentence.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 13.2 _____No Public Announcement_. Upon the execution of this
Agreement, each of the Buyer, RT Partners, RT Investors and the Companies
shall mutually agree on an initial joint press release (the " _Initial Press
Release_ ") with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and which references the identity of the Buyer, RT Partners, RT Investors and
the Companies. Neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor Sellers and the Companies,
on the other hand, shall, without the prior written consent of the other party
hereto (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make or cause to be made any press release or other public
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except as and to the extent that any such party shall be so obligated by
applicable Requirements of Law, in which case the other party shall be advised
and the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause a mutually
agreeable release or announcement to be issued.

Section 13.4 _________________Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
party to this Agreement may transfer this Agreement or assign its rights or
delegate its obligations under this Agreement without the express prior
written consent of the other parties to this Agreement, except that the Buyer
may assign any or all its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any
of its wholly owned Subsidiaries so long as such wholly owned Subsidiary
agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and provisions
contained herein; _provided_ that no such assignment shall release the Buyer
from any liability or obligation under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer may assign this Agreement and its
rights hereunder to any of the financing sources of Buyer (including the
lenders pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing Documents to the extent
necessary for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise
assigning as collateral in respect of the Debt Financing or any Alternative
Debt Financing). In addition, the Debt Financing Sources are intended third
party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, this _Section _ _13.4_ , _Section
13.6_ and _Section 13.16(b)_.

 



 

Section 13.5 ___________________________Access to Records after Closing_.
Subject to _Section 13.1_ , for a period of six (6) years after the Closing
Date, the Stockholder Representative and its representatives shall have
reasonable access to all of the books and records of the Acquired Companies
relating to any period prior to the Closing and reasonably related to the
Relevant Matters to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by
the Stockholder Representative (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other
Seller) only in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns or other
documents related to Tax matters (the " _Relevant Matters_ "), subject to any
applicable Requirements of Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not
be required to violate any obligation of confidentiality to which Buyer or any
Acquired Company is subject or to waive any privilege (including the attorney-
client privilege) which any of them may possess in discharging its obligations
pursuant to this _Section 13.5_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the auditors and
independent accountants of the Buyer or its Affiliates shall not be obligated
to make any work papers available to any Person unless and until such Person
has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to
such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
auditors or independent accountants. If so reasonably requested by the Buyer,
the Stockholder Representative and its representatives, as applicable, shall
enter into a customary joint defense agreement with any one or more of the
Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to any information to be provided to the
Stockholder Representative and its representatives pursuant to this _Section
_ _13.5_. The Stockholder Representative shall be solely responsible for any
costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this _Section 13.5_. If Buyer or
the Acquired Companies shall desire to dispose of any of such books and
records prior to the expiration of such six (6) year period, Buyer shall,
prior to such disposition, give the Stockholder Representative a reasonable
opportunity, at the Stockholder Representative's expense, to segregate and
remove such books and records relating to any period prior to the Closing and
reasonably related to such matters set forth above.

 



 

Section 13.6 ___________Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, the
Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein, the documents delivered pursuant
hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire understanding of
the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter contained herein or
therein, and supersede all other prior representations, warranties,
agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among any of the
parties hereto. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented
except by a written instrument signed by Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of Sellers). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this _Section 13.6_ , none of _Section 13.4_ or _Section
13.16(b)_ or this sentence may be modified or amended in a manner that is
adverse in any respect to any Debt Financing Source without the prior written
consent of such Debt Financing Source (and any such consent of a Debt
Financing Source, to the extent given, shall be effective with respect to such
Debt Financing Source and with respect to each of its Affiliates and Persons
constituting a Debt Financing Source due to its relationship with such Debt
Financing Source). The Debt Financing Sources are intended third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 13.6_.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 13.7 ___Interpretation_. Disclosure of any fact or item in any
Schedule hereto referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other section in this
Agreement so long as the applicability of such matter to such section is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. Neither the specification
of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is
intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so
included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the
fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item
in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement
specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item or
matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply
that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the
ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting
forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not in the ordinary
course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 13.8 ___Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any
party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such
party. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the
specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the
rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other
time. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in
any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the
right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No
waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall constitute a continuing waiver or
shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

 



 

Section 13.9 ___Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein, each party
hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all
agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or
complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel
and independent public accountants.

 



 



 

 



   



 

Section 13.10 ___Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision
hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would
be unreasonable.

 



 

Section 13.11 ___Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts (including via fax or .pdf), each of which shall be considered
an original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to Sellers, the Companies
and Buyer.

 



 

Section 13.12 ___Further Assurances_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all
action, to do or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations or otherwise to consummate and make effective, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the End Date, including the
execution and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other
actions as the other party hereto may reasonably require in order to carry out
the intent of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 13.13 ___Disclaimer of Warranties_. Neither Sellers nor the
Companies make any representations or warranties with respect to any
projections, forecasts or forward-looking information provided to Buyer.
EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH SELLER
IS SELLING THE SHARES (AND THE BUSINESS AND ASSETS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES
REPRESENTED THEREBY) ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND EACH SELLER AND EACH
COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTIES,
WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND NO SELLER OR COMPANY MAKES ANY (A)
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
PURPOSE OR (B) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. Buyer acknowledges that no
Seller nor any of their respective representatives or Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies) or any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
memoranda, charts or summaries heretofore made available by Sellers or any of
their respective representatives or Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) to Buyer or any other information which is not included in this
Agreement or the Schedules, and no Seller nor any of its respective
representatives or Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) or any other
Person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer, any Affiliate of
Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution of any such
information to, or use of any such information by, Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer or any of its agents, consultants, accountants, counsel or other
representatives. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is not entitled to rely
upon any representations or warranties or other statements of fact or opinion,
other than the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 13.14 __

 |  

 _Enforcement_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto agrees that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement to be performed by
Buyer, Sellers or the Companies were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, prior to any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , Buyer, each Seller
and each Company, as applicable, shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement by the other parties hereto, as applicable, and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any state or
federal court in the State of New York, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Buyer, each Seller
and each Company hereby further waive (i) any defense in any action for
specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any
Requirements of Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that
the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. Each of the parties hereto further agrees that the
seeking of the remedies pursuant to _Section 13.14(a)_ shall not constitute a
waiver by any party seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to it under this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

Section 13.15 _________Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in any other documents delivered pursuant hereto, (i) this
Agreement may be enforced only against, and any Proceeding based upon, arising
out of or related to a breach of this Agreement by Sellers may be made only
against, Sellers (or, with respect to _Section 8.3_ , GP), (ii) none of any
Seller's Affiliates (except, with respect to _Section 8.3_ , GP) or such
Seller's (in the case of any such Seller which is not a natural person) or its
Affiliates' respective current, former or future directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members, stockholders, assignees or
representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Related Parties_ ") shall have
any liability for any liabilities of the parties hereto for any such
Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) for breach of this
Agreement or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith, and (iii) Buyer shall have no rights of recovery in
respect of this Agreement against any Seller Related Party, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through any Proceeding
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) by or on behalf of a Seller against
any Seller Related Party, by the enforcement of any judgment, fine or penalty
or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Requirements of
Law, or otherwise.

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in all respects,
including as to validity, interpretation and effect, in accordance with the
internal Requirements of Law (without regard to principles of conflicts of
law) of the State of New York. By the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Buyer, Sellers and the Companies irrevocably submit to the personal
jurisdiction of any state or federal court in the State of New York in any
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. EACH OF THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any
Person in any action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other
than the federal and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan
within the City of New York, (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether
at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or
rules or conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require
or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction and (iii) hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising
out of or relating in any way to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. The Debt
Financing Sources are intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section

      |  

Section 13.17 __

 |  

 _Certain Matters Regarding Representation of the Companies and Certain
Sellers_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) Sidley Austin LLP (" _Sidley_ ") has acted as counsel for the
Companies, RT Partners and RT Investors (the " _Clients_ ") in connection with
this Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the Seller Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (the "
_Transaction Engagement_ ") and in that connection not as counsel for any
other Person, including Buyer or its Affiliates. Only the Clients shall be
considered clients of Sidley in the Transaction Engagement. The parties hereto
acknowledge the community of interest between the Clients and certain Sellers
which are not Clients in light of the fact that Sellers hold all of the equity
of the Companies. Accordingly, notwithstanding that the Clients are or were
clients in the Transaction Engagement, upon and after the Closing, all
communications between Sellers, the Stockholder Representative or the
Companies and Sidley in the course of the Transaction Engagement shall be
deemed to be attorney-client confidences for which the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belong solely to and shall
be controlled solely by Sellers and the Stockholder Representative and not the
Companies. Buyer shall not have access to any such communications, or to the
files of Sidley relating to the Transaction Engagement, whether or not the
Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
notwithstanding that the Companies are or were clients in the Transaction
Engagement, upon and after the Closing, (i) Sellers and the Stockholder
Representative shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege and
control thereof with respect to communications between Sellers, the
Stockholder Representative or the Companies and Sidley relating to the
Transaction Engagement, to the extent such privilege exists, and none of the
Companies, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates shall be a holder of
such attorney-client privilege or control thereof, (ii) to the extent that
files of Sidley in respect of the Transaction Engagement constitute property
of the Clients, including the Companies, only the Sellers or the Stockholder
Representative shall hold such property rights, and (iii) Sidley shall have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications
or files to the Companies, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Sidley and the Companies or
otherwise.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) If Sellers or the Stockholder Representative so desire, and without
the need for any consent or waiver by the Companies or Buyer, Sidley shall be
permitted to represent Sellers or the Stockholder Representative after the
Closing in connection with any matter, including anything related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements
and the Seller Ancillary Agreements or any disagreement or dispute relating
thereto arising after the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing sentence, after the Closing, Sidley shall be permitted to represent
Sellers or the Stockholder Representative, any of their Affiliates or
representatives, or any one or more of them, in connection with any
negotiation, transaction or dispute (whereas "dispute" includes litigation,
arbitration or other adversarial proceedings) with Buyer, the Companies or any
of their Affiliates or representatives under or relating to this Agreement,
the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the Seller Ancillary Agreements, any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements or
the Seller Ancillary Agreements, and any related matter, such as claims for
indemnification and disputes involving non-solicitation or other agreements
entered into in connection with this Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements
or the Seller Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(c) Upon and after the Closing, the Companies shall cease to have any
attorney-client relationship with Sidley, unless Sidley is specifically
engaged in writing by any Company to represent such Company after the Closing
and either such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to
