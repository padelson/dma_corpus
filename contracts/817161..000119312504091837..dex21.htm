v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of the 18th day of May 2004, by and among Cardinal Health, Inc., an
Ohio corporation (" _Cardinal Health_ "), Blue Merger Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health (" _Subcorp_ "),
and ALARIS Medical Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _ALARIS_ ").



PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS



A. The board of directors of ALARIS (the " _ALARIS Board_ ") has, in light of
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, (i)
approved this Agreement, and deemed the Agreement, the Offer (as defined in
Preliminary Statement B), the Merger (as defined in Preliminary Statement C),
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, advisable, fair to and
in the best interests of the ALARIS Stockholders (as defined in Section
1.1(b)), (ii) resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer to the ALARIS
Stockholders, and (iii) resolved to recommend the approval and adoption by
the ALARIS Stockholders of this Agreement, including the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent required under
Applicable Laws (as defined in Section 3.2(d)). 



B. In furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Subcorp shall commence a
tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this
Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding
shares of ALARIS Common Stock (as defined in Section 5.4) at a price
of $22.35 per share of ALARIS Common Stock, net to the seller in cash (such
amount, or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, the " _Per
Share Amount_ ").



C. Following the consummation of the Offer, Cardinal Health desires to combine
its businesses with the businesses operated by ALARIS through the merger of
Subcorp with and into ALARIS, with ALARIS as the surviving corporation (the "
_Merger_ "), pursuant to which each share of ALARIS Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2), other than the
shares of ALARIS Common Stock owned by Cardinal Health, Subcorp or ALARIS (or
any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (as
defined in Section 9.3)) and other than the Appraisal Shares (as defined in
Section 3.1(d)), will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (as defined in Section 3.1(e)), all as more fully provided in
this Agreement.



D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and
inducement to Cardinal Healths willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Cardinal Health and the majority stockholder of ALARIS (together with
affiliated parties) (" _ALARIS  Majority Stockholder_") are entering into the
Support/Tender Agreement, dated as of May 18, 2004, between Cardinal Health
and ALARIS Majority Stockholder (the " _Support Agreement_ ") in respect of
shares of ALARIS Common Stock beneficially owned by such stockholder ("
_ALARIS  Majority Stockholders Shares_").



 

1 AGREEMENT



 

Now, therefore, in consideration of these premises and the mutual and
dependent promises hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as
follows: 



ARTICLE I



THE OFFER

1.1. _The Offer_.



(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII and none of the events or conditions set forth in Annex
A (other than clauses (b), (f), (h) and (i)) shall have occurred and be
existing, Cardinal Health shall cause Subcorp to commence, and Subcorp shall
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the
" _Exchange Act_ ")), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement and in any event within 10 business days after the date of this
Agreement, the Offer. Cardinal Health shall cause Subcorp to accept for
payment, and Subcorp shall accept for payment, all shares of ALARIS Common
Stock that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
at the earliest time following the initial Expiration Date (as defined in
Section 1.1(c)) at which time all conditions of the Offer shall have been
satisfied or waived by Subcorp, and, thereafter, Subcorp shall accept for
payment all additional shares of ALARIS Common Stock validly tendered during
any subsequent offering period to the extent Cardinal Health and Subcorp
determine to provide a subsequent offering period in connection with the
Offer, provided Cardinal Health and Subcorp are permitted to do so pursuant to
Section 1.1(c). Subcorp shall not accept for payment any shares of ALARIS
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer unless there shall have been
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date such number of
shares of ALARIS Common Stock that satisfy the Minimum Condition (as defined
in Annex A). Subcorp expressly reserves the right to increase the Per Share
Amount and to waive any condition of the Offer, except the Minimum Condition.
Without the prior written consent of ALARIS, Subcorp shall not decrease the
Per Share Amount or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
decrease the number of shares of ALARIS Common Stock sought to be purchased in
the Offer, impose conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in
Annex A, change or waive the Minimum Condition or, except as provided in
Section 1.1(c), extend the expiration of the Offer beyond the initial
Expiration Date, or amend any other term of the Offer in a manner materially
adverse to the ALARIS Stockholders. The Per Share Amount shall be paid less
any required withholding of Taxes (as defined in Section 5.12(h)), upon the
terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer set
forth in Annex A. ALARIS agrees that no shares of ALARIS Common Stock held by
ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.



(b) Subcorp shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_Commission_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer on the date the Offer is commenced, which shall include an offer to
purchase, form of transmittal letter and form of notice of guaranteed delivery
(together with any supplements or amendments thereto, collectively, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer



 

2 Documents to be disseminated to the ALARIS Stockholders in accordance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the United States
federal securities laws. Cardinal Health and Subcorp will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the United States federal securities laws. The information
provided and to be provided by ALARIS, Cardinal Health and Subcorp for use in
the Offer Documents shall not, on the date filed with the Commission and on
the date first published or sent or given to holders of shares of
ALARIS Common Stock (the "ALARIS Stockholders"), as the case may be, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading except that no representation is made by Cardinal Health with
respect to the information supplied by ALARIS for inclusion in the Offer
Documents. ALARIS, Cardinal Health and Subcorp each agree promptly to correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and Cardinal Health further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the Commission and
disseminated to the ALARIS Stockholders to the extent required by applicable
United States federal securities laws. ALARIS shall promptly furnish to
Cardinal Health or Subcorp all information concerning ALARIS that is required
or reasonably requested by Cardinal Health or Subcorp in connection with the
obligations relating to the Offer Documents contained in this Section 1.1(b).
ALARIS and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment
on the Offer Documents sufficiently in advance of filing with the Commission
or dissemination to the ALARIS Stockholders.



(c) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall remain open
until midnight, New York City time, on the date that is 20 business days
after the date the Offer is commenced (the initial " _Expiration Date_ ," and
any expiration time and date established pursuant to an authorized extension
of the Offer as so extended, also an " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided,
however_ , that, without the consent of ALARIS, Subcorp may (i) extend the
Offer for one or more periods of not more than five business days not to
exceed an aggregate of 15 business days if, at the scheduled Expiration Date,
any of the conditions of the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived
until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived to the extent
permitted by this Agreement; (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by
any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Commission or the
staff of the Commission (the " _SEC Staff_ ") thereof applicable to the Offer;
or (iii) extend the Offer for one subsequent offering period (as provided in
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) for three to 20 business days in order to
acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of ALARIS Common Stock or
otherwise. Upon the written request of ALARIS, Cardinal Health agrees to cause
Subcorp to extend the Offer for one or more periods not to exceed an
aggregate of 15 business days, if, as of any Expiration Date, all of the
conditions of the Offer are not satisfied, but such conditions are reasonably
capable of being satisfied in such period. Cardinal Health and Subcorp shall
comply with the obligations respecting prompt payment and announcement under
the Exchange Act, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Subcorp shall, and Cardinal Health shall cause Subcorp to, accept
for payment, and pay for, all shares of ALARIS Common Stock validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly following the acceptance of
the shares of ALARIS Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer and this
Agreement.

 



 

3 1.2. _Company Action_.



(a) ALARIS hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, and represents and
warrants that the ALARIS Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, unanimously
(i) approved this Agreement, and deemed this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement advisable, fair to and in
the best interests of the ALARIS Stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement,
the Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Support Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, in all respects,
and such approval constitutes approval of the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement and the Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated by such
agreements for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ "); and (iii) resolved to recommend that the ALARIS
Stockholders accept the Offer, that the ALARIS Stockholders tender their
shares of ALARIS Common Stock under the Offer to Subcorp, and that the ALARIS
Stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger to the extent
required by Applicable Laws. ALARIS consents to the inclusion of such approval
and recommendation in the Offer Documents.



(b) ALARIS hereby agrees to file with the Commission, as soon as reasonably
practicable on the day the Offer is commenced, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_ ") containing the recommendation described in Section 1.2(a) and to
promptly mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the ALARIS Stockholders together with the
Offer Documents and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to the ALARIS Stockholders in accordance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the United States
federal securities laws. Cardinal Health, Subcorp, and their counsel shall be
given the opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 sufficiently
in advance of its filing with the Commission. ALARIS will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the United States federal
securities laws. The information provided and to be provided by ALARIS,
Cardinal Health and Subcorp for use in the Schedule 14D-9 shall not, on the
date filed with the Commission and on the date first published or sent or
given to the ALARIS Stockholders, as the case may be, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
that no representation is made by ALARIS with respect to the information
supplied in writing by Cardinal Health or Subcorp for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9. ALARIS will use its reasonable best efforts to comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the United States
federal securities laws. ALARIS, Cardinal Health and Subcorp each agree
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and ALARIS further agrees to take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the Commission
and disseminated to the ALARIS Stockholders to the extent required by the
applicable requirements of the United States federal securities laws. Cardinal
Health and Subcorp shall promptly furnish to ALARIS all information
concerning Cardinal Health and Subcorp that is required or reasonably
requested by ALARIS in connection with the obligations relating to the
Schedule 14D-9 contained in this Section 1.2(b). 



 

4 (c) In connection with the Offer, ALARIS promptly will furnish (or cause its
transfer agent to furnish) Cardinal Health and Subcorp with mailing labels,
security position listings and any available listing or computer files
containing the names and addresses of the ALARIS Stockholders as of a recent
date, and shall furnish Subcorp with such additional information and
assistance (including, without limitation, updated lists of the ALARIS
Stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Subcorp or
its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record
and beneficial holders of shares of ALARIS Common Stock. Except as required
by Applicable Laws, and except as necessary to communicate the Offer, the
Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the ALARIS
Stockholders, Cardinal Health and Subcorp (and their respective
representatives) shall hold in confidence the information contained in any
such labels, listings and files to the extent required by the confidentiality
agreement between Cardinal Health and ALARIS, dated March 8, 2004 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").



1.3.  _Board of Directors_.



(a) Promptly upon the acceptance of any shares of ALARIS Common Stock for
payment by Cardinal Health or Subcorp or any of their affiliates pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms of the Offer (the " _Appointment Time_ ") and
this Agreement and from time to time thereafter, and subject to Section
1.3(c), Subcorp shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors,
rounded to the nearest whole number constituting at least a majority of the
directors, on the ALARIS Board as will give Subcorp representation on the
ALARIS Board equal to the product of the number of directors on the ALARIS
Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to
this Section 1.3) and the percentage that such number of shares of
ALARIS Common Stock so purchased bears to the total number of outstanding
shares of ALARIS Common Stock, and ALARIS shall use all reasonable efforts to,
upon Subcorps request, promptly, at Subcorps election, either increase the
size of the ALARIS Board or secure the resignation of such number of
directors as is necessary to enable Subcorps designees to be elected to the
ALARIS Board and to cause Subcorps designees to be so elected. At such times,
subject to Section 1.3(c), ALARIS will cause individuals designated by
Subcorp to constitute a majority of each committee of the ALARIS Board, other
than any committee of the ALARIS Board established to take action under this
Agreement which committee shall be composed only of Independent Directors (as
defined in Section 1.3(c)).



(b) ALARIS obligation to appoint designees to the ALARIS Board shall be
subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. ALARIS
promptly shall take all action required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Section 1.3, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to ALARIS and its officers and directors as is
required pursuant to such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3 and the
United States federal securities laws, _provided_ , _that_ , Subcorp shall
have provided to ALARIS prior to the filing with the Commission of the
Schedule 14D-9 the information and consents with respect to Subcorp and its
designees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. Subcorp will supply to ALARIS in
writing any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers,
directors and affiliates required under the Exchange Act pursuant to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.



 

5 (c) In the event that Subcorps designees are elected or designated to the
ALARIS Board, then, until the Effective Time, ALARIS shall cause the ALARIS
Board to have at least two directors who are directors on the date of this
Agreement, including at least two directors who are (i) selected by such
current directors and (ii) independent directors for purposes of the
continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"NYSE") (such directors, the "Independent Directors"), _provided, however_ ,
that, if any Independent Director is unable to serve due to death or
disability or any other reason, the remaining Independent Directors shall be
entitled to elect or designate another individual (or individuals) who
serve(s) as a director (or directors) on the date of this Agreement (provided
that no such individual is an employee of ALARIS or its subsidiaries) to fill
the vacancy, and such director (or directors) shall be deemed to be an
Independent Director (or Independent Directors) for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate two individuals who are directors on the date of this Agreement,
provided that such individuals shall not be employees, officers, directors or
affiliates of ALARIS, Cardinal Health or Subcorp (or, in the event there
shall be less than two directors available to fill the vacancies as a result
of such individuals deaths, disabilities or refusals to serve, such smaller
number of individuals who are directors on the date of this Agreement)
to fill the vacancies and such directors shall be deemed Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Following the Appointment Time and
prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal Health and Subcorp shall cause any
amendment of this Agreement, any amendment of the ALARIS Certificate or the
ALARIS By-laws (each as defined in Section 2.6(a)), any termination of this
Agreement by ALARIS, any extension by ALARIS of the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of Subcorp or Cardinal Health or
waiver of any of ALARIS rights under this Agreement or other action adversely
affecting the rights of the ALARIS Stockholders (other than Cardinal Health or
Subcorp), not to be effected without the affirmative vote of a majority of
the Independent Directors. Following the Appointment Time and prior to the
Effective Time, neither Cardinal Health nor Subcorp shall take any action to
remove any Independent Director absent cause.



ARTICLE II

2.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, Subcorp
shall be merged with and into ALARIS at the Effective Time. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Subcorp shall cease and ALARIS
shall continue its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health. ALARIS, in its capacity as the
corporation surviving the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware
Secretary of State_ ") a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_
") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with Section 251
of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger
has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as
shall be agreed upon by Cardinal Health and ALARIS and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").



 

6 Prior to the filing referred to in this Section 2.2, a closing (the "
_Closing_ ") shall be held at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz,

parties hereto may agree on, as soon as practicable following the date upon
which all conditions set forth in Article VII that are capable of being
satisfied prior to the Closing have been satisfied or waived, or at such other
date as Cardinal Health and ALARIS may agree but in no event later than three
business days after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set
forth in Article VII; _provided_ that the conditions set forth in Article VII
that are capable of being satisfied prior to the Closing have been satisfied
or waived at or prior to such date, and _provided, further_ , that the Closing
shall be delayed if and only for so long as reasonably necessary if a banking
moratorium, act of terrorism or war (whether or not declared) affecting
United States banking or financial markets generally prevents the Closing
(such date, the " _Closing Date_ ").



 

2.3. _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. 



2.4. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_. The Certificate of Merger
shall provide that, at the Effective Time, (a) the Surviving Corporations
Certificate of Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended as of the Effective Time so as to contain
the provisions, and only the provisions, contained immediately prior thereto
in Subcorps Certificate of Incorporation, except for Article I thereof, which
shall read "The name of the corporation is ALARIS MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC.",
and (b) Subcorps By-laws in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Surviving Corporations By-laws; in each case, until amended in
accordance with the DGCL.



2.5. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. From and after
the Effective Time, the officers of ALARIS shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation and the directors of Subcorp shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified. On or prior to the Closing Date, ALARIS shall
deliver to Cardinal Health evidence satisfactory to Cardinal Health of the
resignations of the directors of ALARIS (other than those designated by
Cardinal Health pursuant to Section 1.3), such resignations to be effective
as of the Effective Time.



2.6. _ALARIS Stockholders  Meeting._



(a) If required by Applicable Laws in order to consummate the Merger, ALARIS
shall, in accordance with Applicable Laws and ALARIS Certificate of
Incorporation, as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _ALARIS
Certificate_ "), and ALARIS By-laws, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement (the " _ALARIS By-laws_ "):



(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the
ALARIS Stockholders to consider and vote upon approval of the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable following the acceptance for payment of shares of ALARIS Common
Stock by Subcorp pursuant to the Offer (or, if later, following the
termination of the subsequent offering period, if any) for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement (the " _ALARIS Stockholders
 Meeting_"); and



 

7 (ii) prepare and file with the Commission a preliminary proxy or information
statement relating to this Agreement, and take all lawful actions (A) to
obtain and furnish the information required to be included by the Commission
in the Proxy Statement (as defined below), and, after consultation with
Cardinal Health, to respond promptly to any comments made by the Commission
or the SEC Staff with respect to the preliminary proxy statement and cause a
definitive proxy statement (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be mailed to the ALARIS Stockholders
as soon as practicable, which Proxy Statement shall include all information
required under Applicable Laws to be furnished to the ALARIS Stockholders in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and shall include the ALARIS Board Recommendation (as defined
in Section 5.24) to the extent not previously withdrawn in compliance with

Agreement by the ALARIS Stockholders.



(b) Subject to Section 6.3(b), ALARIS shall, through the ALARIS Board,
recommend to the ALARIS Stockholders approval and adoption of this Agreement,
including the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, shall not withdraw,
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Cardinal Health the ALARIS Board
Recommendation. ALARIS shall ensure that the ALARIS Stockholders Meeting is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited
in connection with the ALARIS Stockholders Meeting are solicited, in
compliance with Applicable Laws. Cardinal Health agrees that it will vote, or
cause to be voted, all of the shares of ALARIS Common Stock then owned by it,
Subcorp or any of Cardinal Healths other subsidiaries in favor of the
approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) ALARIS agrees
that its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the ALARIS
Stockholders Meeting, as required by this Section 2.6, shall not be affected
by the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the ALARIS Board
Recommendation, and (ii) ALARIS agrees that its obligations pursuant to this
Section 2.6 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to ALARIS of any Superior Proposal (as defined in
Section 6.3(b)).



2.7. _Merger Without Stockholders Meeting._ Notwithstanding Section 2.6, in
the event that Cardinal Health or Subcorp shall acquire, together with the
shares of ALARIS Common Stock owned by Cardinal Health, Subcorp and any other
subsidiary of Cardinal Health, at least 90% of the outstanding shares of
ALARIS Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the parties hereto agree to take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective
as soon as practicable after the Appointment Time in accordance with Section
253 of the DGCL without a meeting of the ALARIS Stockholders.



 

8 2.8. _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of ALARIS or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of
this Agreement, ALARIS and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have
granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to
take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title
to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the
name of ALARIS or otherwise to take any and all such action.



ARTICLE III



CONVERSION OF SECURITIES



3.1. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Cardinal Health, Subcorp or
ALARIS or their respective shareholders and stockholders, as applicable:



(a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Subcorp (" _Subcorp Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. Such newly issued shares
shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding Surviving
Corporation capital stock.



(b) Each share of ALARIS Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, excluding any shares of ALARIS Common Stock owned
by Cardinal Health, Subcorp or ALARIS or any of their respective subsidiaries
or any stockholders properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ "), as provided in Section 3.1(d), shall be
converted into and represent the right to receive in cash, without interest,
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all
shares of ALARIS Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and automatically
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any shares of ALARIS
Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration or in the case
of holders of Appraisal Shares the right to receive the applicable payments
set forth in Section 3.1(d).



(c) Each share of ALARIS capital stock held in the treasury of ALARIS
automatically shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall be made in
respect thereof.



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the shares of
ALARIS Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time



 

9 that are held by any ALARIS Stockholder that is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of shares of ALARIS Common Stock pursuant to, and
that complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 (the "
_Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(b), but, instead, such ALARIS
Stockholder shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are
granted by Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and, except as otherwise provided by Applicable Laws, each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Appraisal
Shares, other than such rights as are granted by Section 262. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such ALARIS Stockholder shall fail to validly perfect or
shall otherwise waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
ALARIS Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262,
then the rights of such ALARIS Stockholder under Section 262 shall cease, and
such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(b) without interest. ALARIS shall
give prompt notice to Cardinal Health of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of ALARIS Common Stock, and Cardinal Health shall have the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, ALARIS shall not, without the prior
written consent of Cardinal Health, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.



(e) The " _Merger Consideration_ " shall be equal to the Per Share Amount.



3.2. _Surrender and Payment_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, on behalf of the ALARIS Stockholders,
Cardinal Health shall designate, or shall cause to be designated (pursuant to
an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Cardinal Health),
EquiServe Trust Company or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to ALARIS to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of Certificates, upon surrender of such Certificates in accordance
with this Article III from time to time after the Effective Time (the "
_Paying Agent_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal Health shall deposit,
or cause Subcorp to deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in amounts sufficient
for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b) upon
surrender of such Certificates (such cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed
by Cardinal Health, on a daily basis, _provided_ that no such investment shall
affect Cardinal Healths obligation to pay the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Merger Agreement. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income resulting from
investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains undistributed to the ALARIS
Stockholders six months after the date of the mailing required by
Section 3.2(b) shall be delivered to Cardinal Health, upon demand by Cardinal
Health, and holders of Certificates that have not theretofore complied with
this Section 3.2 shall thereafter look only to Cardinal Health for payment of
any claim to the Merger Consideration.



 

10 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Cardinal Health shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates held by such ALARIS Stockholder shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other customary provisions as Cardinal Health may
reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be reasonably appointed by Cardinal Health, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash into which the shares of ALARIS Common Stock formerly
represented by the Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
3.1(b), and the Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of ALARIS Common Stock that is not registered in the
stock transfer books of ALARIS, the proper amount of cash may be paid in
exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Cardinal Health that the Tax has been paid
or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.



(c) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of ALARIS shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of ALARIS Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III.



(d) _No Liability_. None of Cardinal Health, Subcorp, ALARIS or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. All funds held by the Paying Agent for payment to the holders of
unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed six months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Cardinal Health, after which time any holder of
unsurrendered Certificates shall look as a general creditor only to Cardinal
Health for payment of the funds to which the holder of unsurrendered
Certificates may be due, subject to Applicable Laws. If any Certificates shall
not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time, any
such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall,
to the extent permitted by all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules,
regulations, policies or guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or
orders entered by any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 4.3(d)),
in each case, to the extent applicable (collectively, " _Applicable Laws_ "),
become the property of Cardinal Health, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



 

11 (e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming a Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Cardinal Health or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Cardinal Health or the
Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall pay in respect of the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration.



(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in ALARIS Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article III in respect
of Certificates that have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of ALARIS Common Stock represented thereby.



(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Cardinal
Health shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to
deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any ALARIS Stockholders such amounts as it may be required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder, the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state or local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Cardinal Health, as the case may be, the withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
ALARIS Stockholders in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made
by the Surviving Corporation or Cardinal Health, as the case may be.



3.3. _Treatment of Stock Options_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal Health and ALARIS shall take all
actions as may be necessary to cause (i) each unexpired and unexercised
outstanding option granted or issued under ALARIS stock option plans in effect
on the date of this Agreement and listed on Section 5.15(b) to the ALARIS
Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Section 5.1) that remains outstanding and
unexercised as of the Effective Time (each, an " _ALARIS Option_ ") to be
automatically converted at the Effective Time into a vested option (a "
_Cardinal Health Exchange Option_ ") to purchase that number of common shares,
without par value, of Cardinal Health (" _Cardinal Health Common Shares_ "),
equal to the number of shares of ALARIS Common Stock subject to the ALARIS
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the ratio of the
Merger Consideration over the average closing price of Cardinal Health common
stock on the last five trading days immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such ratio, the " _Conversion Ratio_ ") (and rounded down to the nearest
whole share), with an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price per
share that existed under the corresponding ALARIS Option divided by the
Conversion Ratio (and rounded up to the nearest whole cent), and with other
terms and conditions that are the same as the terms and conditions of the
ALARIS Option immediately before the Effective Time; _provided_ that, to the
extent practicable, with respect to any ALARIS Option that is an "incentive
stock option" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code), the foregoing
conversion shall be carried out in a manner satisfying the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code, and (ii) no further issuances of ALARIS Common
Stock, following the Effective Time, with respect to any ALARIS Option or
other equity-based award. In connection



 

12 with the issuance of Cardinal Health Exchange Options, Cardinal Health shall
(i) reserve for issuance the number of Cardinal Health Common Shares that
will become subject to Cardinal Health Exchange Options pursuant to this
Section 3.3, and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, upon exercise of
Cardinal Health Exchange Options, make available for issuance all Cardinal
Health Common Shares covered thereby, subject to the terms and conditions
applicable thereto and to Applicable Laws. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, following the Appointment Time, ALARIS may take action with
respect to any ALARIS Option to provide for payment to the holder of such
ALARIS Option, the excess of the Merger Consideration less the exercise price
for such ALARIS Option times the number of shares of ALARIS Common Stock
represented by such ALARIS Option and taking into account any withholding of
taxes. To the extent reasonably requested by ALARIS in writing, Cardinal
Health will advance funds necessary to finance ALARIS obligation with respect
to the foregoing sentence.



(b) Cardinal Health agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to file
with the Commission, within 15 days after the Closing Date, a registration
statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the "
_Securities Act_ ") to register Cardinal Health Common Shares issuable upon
exercise of the Cardinal Health Exchange Options and to use its reasonable
efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective until the
exercise or expiration of the Cardinal Health Exchange Options.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time: (i) the board of directors of Cardinal
Health, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the Commission
so that the acquisition by any officer or director of ALARIS, who may become
a covered person of Cardinal Health (if any) for purposes of Section 16 under
the Exchange Act (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, "
_Section 16_ "), of Cardinal Health Exchange Options pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16; and (ii) the ALARIS Board, or an appropriate committee of non-
employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with
the interpretive guidance of the Commission so that the disposition by any
officer or director of ALARIS who is a covered person of ALARIS for purposes
of Section 16 of shares of ALARIS Common Stock or ALARIS Options pursuant to
this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16.



(d) Cardinal Health shall be permitted to make additional grants of equal
amounts under the ALARIS stock option plans following the Effective Time for
an amount of Cardinal Health Common Shares equal to the number of shares of
ALARIS Common Stock under ALARIS stock option plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are not subject to outstanding awards, multiplied by the
Conversion Ratio.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ALARIS



In order to induce Subcorp and Cardinal Health to enter into this Agreement,
ALARIS hereby represents and warrants to Cardinal Health and Subcorp that
the statements contained in this Article V are true, correct and complete.



5.1. _Organization and Standing_. ALARIS is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
with full corporate power and authority to own, lease, use and operate
its properties and to conduct its business as and where now owned, leased,
used, operated and conducted. Each of ALARIS subsidiaries is an organization
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation with full corporate power and authority to own,
lease, use and operate its properties and to conduct its business as and where
now owned, leased, used, operated and conducted, except where such failure to
do so would not be material to the operations or businesses of such
subsidiary. ALARIS and each of its subsidiaries are duly qualified to do
business and are in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by them or the property they own, lease or operate
require them to so qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing in such jurisdiction would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
ALARIS. ALARIS is not in default in the performance, observance
or fulfillment of any provision of the ALARIS Certificate or the ALARIS By-
laws. ALARIS has heretofore furnished to Cardinal Health complete and correct
copies of the ALARIS Certificate and the ALARIS By-laws and the certificates
of incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational documents for each of
ALARIS subsidiaries. Listed in Section 5.1 to the disclosure schedule
delivered by ALARIS to Cardinal Health and dated the date of this Agreement
(the " _ALARIS Disclosure Schedule_ ") is each jurisdiction in which ALARIS
or any of its subsidiaries is qualified to do business and whether ALARIS (or
any of its subsidiaries) is in good standing in such jurisdiction as of the
date of this Agreement.



5.2. _Subsidiaries_. ALARIS does not own, directly or indirectly, any equity
or other ownership interest in any corporation, partnership, joint venture or
other entity or enterprise, except as set forth in Section 5.2 to the ALARIS
Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in Section 5.2 to the ALARIS
Disclosure Schedule, ALARIS is not subject to any obligation or requirement
to provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in any such entity or any other person, other than
individually or in the aggregate in _de minimis_ amounts. Except as set forth
in Section 5.2 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, ALARIS owns, directly or
indirectly, each of the outstanding shares of capital stock (or other
ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to
such subsidiary) of each of its subsidiaries. Each of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of each of ALARIS subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and, except as set forth in Section 5.2
to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, is owned, directly or indirectly, by ALARIS
free and clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims or other
encumbrances. The following information for each of ALARIS subsidiaries is
set forth in Section 5.2 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, as applicable: (a)
its name and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization; (b) its
authorized capital stock or share capital; and (c) the number of issued and



 

16 outstanding shares of capital stock or share capital and the record owner(s)
thereof. Other than as set forth in Section 5.2 to the ALARIS Disclosure
Schedule, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
calls, agreements, understandings, claims or other commitments or rights of
any type relating to the issuance, sale or transfer of any securities of any
of ALARIS subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any securities that are
convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock of any of
ALARIS subsidiaries, and neither ALARIS nor any of its subsidiaries has
any obligation of any kind to issue any additional securities or to pay for
or repurchase any securities of any of ALARIS subsidiaries or any predecessor
thereof.



5.3. _Corporate Power and Authority_. ALARIS has all requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, and, subject to approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the ALARIS
Stockholders, if required, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by ALARIS
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
ALARIS, subject to approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the ALARIS Stockholders, if required by
Applicable Laws. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
ALARIS, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Cardinal Health and Subcorp, constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of ALARIS enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms.



5.4. _Capitalization of ALARIS_.



(a) As of May 17, 2004, ALARIS authorized capital stock consisted solely of
(a) 85,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _ALARIS
Common Stock_ "), of which (i) 72,374,798 shares were issued and outstanding,
(ii) no shares were issued and held in treasury, and (iii) ALARIS Options to
purchase 6,456,328 shares of ALARIS Common Stock were outstanding
and 3,695,872 shares were available for grant under the ALARIS Option Plans,

no shares were issued and outstanding or reserved for future issuance under
any agreement, arrangement or understanding, and (c) no other shares of
capital stock of ALARIS or other securities of ALARIS convertible into or

nonassessable, and has not been issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights. Other than as set forth in the first sentence of this Section
5.4, or in Section 5.4 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, there are no
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, agreements,
understandings, claims or other commitments or rights of any type relating to
the issuance, sale, repurchase or transfer of any securities of ALARIS, nor
are there outstanding any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable
for any shares of ALARIS capital stock, and neither ALARIS nor any of its
subsidiaries has any obligation of any kind to issue any additional
securities or to pay for or repurchase any securities of ALARIS or any
predecessor. Section 5.4 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule accurately sets
forth the names of, and the number of shares of each class (including the
number of shares of ALARIS capital stock issuable upon exercise of ALARIS
Options and the exercise price and vesting schedule with respect thereto) and
the number of options held by, all holders of options to purchase
ALARIS capital stock. Section 5.4 to the ALARIS Disclosure



 

17 Schedule states the number of shares of ALARIS Common Stock issuable to each
holder of ALARIS Options pursuant to the ALARIS Options as of the date of
this Agreement, including the applicable vesting schedule, exercise price and
whether the ALARIS Option is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code). 



(b) Except as set forth in Section 5.4 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule,
neither ALARIS nor any of its subsidiaries has agreed to register any
securities under the Securities Act or under any state securities law or
granted registration rights to any individual or entity; complete and correct
copies of any such agreements have previously been provided to Cardinal
Health. There are no outstanding shares of restricted stock of ALARIS. The
issuance and sale of all of the shares of capital stock described in Section
5.4(a) have been in compliance with United States federal securities laws and
in compliance in all material respects with state securities laws.



5.5. _Conflicts; Consents and Approvals_. Neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by ALARIS, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will:



(a) conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, the ALARIS
Certificate or the ALARIS By-laws;



(b) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a default (or an event that, with the giving of notice, the
passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default) under, or entitle
any person (with the giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise) to
terminate, accelerate, modify or call a default under, or result in the
creation of any material lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance upon
any of the properties or assets of ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, contract, undertaking, agreement, lease or
other instrument or obligation to which ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries is a
party;



(c) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets; or



(d) require any action or consent or approval of, or review by, or
registration or filing by ALARIS or any of its affiliates with, any third
party or any Governmental Authority, other than (i) approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by ALARIS Stockholders,
if required, (ii) actions required by the HSR Act, (iii) registrations or
other actions required under United States federal and state securities laws
as are contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) consents of, approvals of,

(v) if applicable, the filing of the Certificate of Merger;



except in the case of Section 5.5(b) that is set forth in Section 5.5(b) to
the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, and in the case of Sections 5.5(c) and 5.5(d)
for any of the foregoing that would not,



 

18 individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on ALARIS or a material adverse effect on the ability
of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



5.6. _Brokerage and Finders  Fees; Expenses_. Except for ALARIS obligations
to ALARIS Financial Advisors (copies of the agreement relating to such
obligations having previously been provided to Cardinal Health), neither
ALARIS nor any stockholder, director, officer, employee or affiliate of
ALARIS, has incurred or will incur on behalf of ALARIS or its subsidiaries,
any brokerage, finders, advisory or similar fee in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.6 to the ALARIS
Disclosure Schedule discloses the maximum aggregate amount of all fees and
expenses that will be paid or will be payable by ALARIS and its subsidiaries
to all attorneys, accountants and investment bankers in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



5.7. _ALARIS SEC Documents; Securities Law Matters_.



(a) ALARIS and its subsidiaries have timely filed with the Commission
all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be
filed by them since January 1, 2001 under the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act (as supplemented and amended since the time of filing, collectively, the "
_ALARIS SEC Documents_ "). The ALARIS SEC Documents, including any financial
statements or schedules included in the ALARIS SEC Documents, at the time
filed (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively, and, in
the case of any ALARIS SEC Document amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such amending or superseding
filing) (i) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, and (ii) complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the
case may be. The consolidated financial statements of ALARIS and its
subsidiaries included in the ALARIS SEC Documents at the time filed (and,
in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively, and, in the case of any
ALARIS SEC Document amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, then on the date of such amending or superseding filing)
complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the Commission
with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto, or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q
of the Commission), and fairly present in all material respects (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments) the
consolidated financial position of ALARIS and its consolidated subsidiaries as
at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended. None of ALARIS subsidiaries is subject
to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or required to file
any form, report or other document with the Commission, the NYSE, any stock
exchange or any other comparable Governmental Authority.



 

19 (b) With respect to each Annual Report on Form 10-K and each Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q included in the ALARIS SEC Documents filed since August 29,
2002, the financial statements and other financial information included in
such reports fairly present (within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002) in all material respects the financial condition and results of
operations of ALARIS as of, and for, the periods presented in the ALARIS SEC
Documents. ALARIS principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to ALARIS
auditors and the audit committee of the ALARIS Board (i) all significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that could
adversely affect ALARIS ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for ALARIS auditors any material
weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
ALARIS internal controls. ALARIS has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-14 under the
Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that material information relating to ALARIS, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to ALARIS principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared; and, to the knowledge of ALARIS, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level in
timely alerting ALARIS principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in ALARIS
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Except as set forth in
Section 5.7(b) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding
loans made by ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries to any executive officer (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of ALARIS. Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, neither ALARIS nor any of its
subsidiaries has made any loans to any executive officer or director of
ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries.



(c) The assets of ALARIS and its subsidiaries that are inventories have a net
realizable value on December 31, 2003 at least equal to the lower of cost or
market value at which such inventories are carried on the balance sheet of
ALARIS as of December 31, 2003 included in the ALARIS SEC Documents, and have
been purchased by ALARIS directly from the manufacturer thereof or from an
authorized distributor of such products in accordance with the Federal
Prescription Drug Marketing Act, if applicable. 



5.8. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by ALARIS and any of its subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is
mailed to the ALARIS Stockholders or at the time of the ALARIS Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary, in order to make the
statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement insofar as it relates to the ALARIS
Stockholders Meeting will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by ALARIS and any of its subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Offer Documents or provided by ALARIS and any of its
subsidiaries in the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the respective times that the
Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 or any amendments or supplements
thereto are filed with the Commission and are first published or sent or given
to the ALARIS Stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or



 

20 omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.



5.9. _Compliance with Law_.



(a) Except as set forth in Section 5.9(a) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule,
ALARIS and its subsidiaries are in compliance, and at all times since January
1, 2001 have been in compliance, in each case, in all material respects, with
Applicable Laws (other than immaterial Applicable Laws) relating to ALARIS
and its subsidiaries or their business or properties.



(b) Except as disclosed in Section 5.9(b) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule,
no material investigation or review by any Governmental Authority

knowledge of ALARIS, threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated
in writing an intention to conduct such an investigation or review.



(c) Except as disclosed in Section 5.9(c) to the ALARIS Disclosure
Schedule, neither ALARIS, nor any of ALARIS respective officers, directors,
stockholders, employees, agents and/or representatives has directly or

present suppliers, contractors or third party payors in order to obtain
business or payments from such persons, (ii) given or agreed to give or is
aware that there has been made or there is any agreement to make any material
gift or gratuitous payment of any kind nature or description to any customer
or potential customer supplier or potential supplier, contractor or third

aware that there has been made or that there is any agreement to make, any
material contribution, payment or gift of funds or property to or for the
private use of any governmental official, employee or agent where either the
contribution, payment or gift is illegal under Applicable Laws, (iv) made, or
agreed to make or is aware that there has been made or that there is any
agreement to make any material payment to any person with the intention or
understanding that any part of such payment would be used for any purpose
other than that described in the document supporting such payment, and/or (v)
conducted business other than in compliance with all applicable anti-kickback
laws and regulations, including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. 1320 a-7b(b) as
amended or any applicable state anti-kickback or other similar state or
federal laws.



(d) Except as disclosed in Section 5.9(d) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule,
(i) neither ALARIS nor any of ALARIS officers, directors,
employees, independent contractors, suppliers and/or agents have been
convicted of, charged with or investigated for a Medicare, Medicaid or state
health program related offense or convicted of, charged with or investigated
for a violation of federal or state law related to Medicare, Medicaid or any
other federal or state health care program, or been subject to any order or
consent decree of, or material criminal or civil fine or penalty imposed by,
any Governmental Authority with respect to any such program; and (ii) ALARIS
has not arranged or contracted with (by employment or otherwise) any
individual that is excluded from participation in a Federal Health Care
Program as defined in 42 U.S.C.1320a-7b(f) for the provision of items or
services for which payment may be made under such Federal Health Care
Program.



 

21 (e) Except as disclosed in Section 5.9(e) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule,
the activities of each of ALARIS, its subsidiaries and their respective
current officers, directors, agents and employees and, to the knowledge of
ALARIS, former officers, directors, agents and employees have complied in all
material respects, and the operations of each of ALARIS and its subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects, with all Applicable Laws governing
corrupt or illicit business practices, including, without limitation, laws
dealing with improper or illegal payments, gifts or gratuities and/or the
payment of money or anything of value directly or indirectly to any person
(whether a government official or private individual) for the purpose of
illegally or improperly inducing any person or government official, or
political party or official thereof, or any candidate for any such position,
in making any decision or improperly assisting any person in obtaining or
retaining business or taking any other action favorable to such person, and/or
dealing with business practices in relation to investments outside of the
United States (including, by way of example, if applicable, the United States
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as amended). None of ALARIS, its subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees of ALARIS
or any of its subsidiaries has, in connection with the conduct of the business
of ALARIS and its subsidiaries, (A) used any funds for unlawful contributions,
gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political
activity, (B) established or maintained any unrecorded fund or asset for any
purpose or made any false entries on the books and records of ALARIS or any
subsidiary for any reason, (C) paid or delivered any fee, commission or any
other sum of money or item of property, however characterized, to any finder,
agent, government official or other party, in the United States or any other
country, which in any manner relates to the assets, business or operations of
ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries in violation of any United States federal,
state, local or foreign law or (D) made any other unlawful payment. The
internal accounting controls and procedures of ALARIS and its subsidiaries are
sufficient to cause compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, as amended.



(f) Except as disclosed in Section 5.9(f) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule,
ALARIS and its subsidiaries have been in compliance in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Privacy Standards, the Electronic
Transactions Standards and the Security Standards promulgated under the
Administrative Simplifications subtitle of the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996.



5.10. _Litigation; Products Liability_. Except as set forth in Section 5.10 to
the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding,
hearing, notice of violation, demand letter or investigation (an " _Action_ ")
pending before any Governmental Authority, or, to the knowledge of ALARIS (or
its executive officers or directors), threatened, against ALARIS or any of
its subsidiaries or any executive officer or director of ALARIS or any of its
subsidiaries which, if adversely determined would be material. Neither ALARIS
nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction that,
individually or in the aggregate, insofar as can be reasonably foreseen, could
have a Material Adverse Effect on ALARIS or a material adverse effect on the
ability of ALARIS to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 5.10 to the ALARIS Disclosure
Schedule, since January 1, 2001, neither ALARIS nor any of its subsidiaries
have been subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction relating to ALARIS or any of its
subsidiaries method of doing business or its or their



 

22 relationship with past, existing or potential users or purchasers of any goods
or services of ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries. Except as set forth in
Section 5.10 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, there is no Action presently
pending, or, to the knowledge of ALARIS (or its executive officers or
directors), threatened, against ALARIS relating to any alleged hazard or
alleged defect in design, manufacture, materials or workmanship, including any
failure to warn or alleged breach of express or implied warranty or
representation, relating to any product manufactured, distributed or sold by
or on behalf of ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries. Except as set forth in
Section 5.10(b) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, neither ALARIS nor any of
its subsidiaries has extended to its customers any written product warranties,
indemnifications or guarantees other than those extended from time to time in
the ordinary course of business.



5.11. _No Material Adverse Change_. Except as set forth in Section 5.11 to the
ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2003 through the date of this
Agreement, there has been no change, development or event that has or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ALARIS or a
material adverse effect on the ability of ALARIS to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



5.12. _Taxes_.



(a) ALARIS and its subsidiaries have duly filed all United States
federal, state and local and foreign income, franchise, excise, real and
personal property and other Tax Returns (as defined in Section 5.12(g)) and
reports (including those filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis)
required to have been filed by ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries prior to the
date of this Agreement, except for Tax Returns the failure of which to file
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in material Tax. All of the foregoing Tax Returns and reports are true and
correct (except for such inaccuracies that are, individually or in the
aggregate, not material), and ALARIS and its subsidiaries have, within the
time and manner prescribed by Applicable Laws, paid or, prior to
the Effective Time, will pay all Taxes required to be paid with respect to
the periods covered by such Tax Returns or reports or otherwise due before the
Effective Time, except for such amounts that are not, individually or in the
aggregate, material. Except as disclosed in Section 5.12 to the ALARIS
Disclosure Schedule, neither ALARIS nor any of its subsidiaries has any
material liability for any Taxes in excess of the amounts so paid or reserves
so established, and neither ALARIS nor any of its subsidiaries is delinquent
in the payment of any material Tax for which it is liable. None of them has
requested or filed any document having the effect of causing any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Returns that, individually or in the
aggregate, are material in respect of any fiscal year that have not since been
filed. No deficiencies for any material Tax have been proposed, asserted or
assessed (tentatively or definitely), in each case, in writing by any taxing
authority, against ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries for which there are not
adequate reserves. All such currently proposed deficiencies which are material
are set forth in Section 5.12 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule. Except as set
forth in Section 5.12 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, neither ALARIS nor
any of its subsidiaries is the subject of any currently ongoing Tax audit. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending requests for waivers of
the time to assess any material Tax, other than those made in the ordinary
course and for which payment has been made or there are adequate reserves.
With respect to any taxable period ended prior to January 1, 1996, all United
States federal Tax Returns including ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries have
been audited by the Internal Revenue Service or other Governmental Authority,
as applicable, or



 

23 are closed by the applicable statute of limitations. Neither ALARIS nor any of
its subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency, except with respect to Taxes that are, individually or in the
aggregate, not material. There are no liens with respect to Taxes upon any of
the properties or assets, real or personal, tangible or intangible of ALARIS
or any of its subsidiaries (other than liens for Taxes not yet due or liens
that, individually or in the aggregate, are not material). No claim has ever
been made in writing by a taxing authority that ALARIS is or may be subject
to taxation by a jurisdiction in which ALARIS does not or has not filed Tax
Returns. No claim has ever been made in writing by a taxing authority that a
subsidiary of ALARIS is or may be subject to taxation by a jurisdiction in
which such subsidiary does not or has not filed Tax Returns.



(b) Neither ALARIS nor any of its subsidiaries is obligated by any contract,
agreement or other arrangement to indemnify any other person with respect
to material Taxes. Neither ALARIS nor any of its subsidiaries are now or have
ever been a party to or bound by any agreement or arrangement (whether or not
written and including any arrangement required or permitted by law) binding
ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries that (i) requires ALARIS or any of its
subsidiaries to make any material Tax payment to or for the account of any
other person, (ii) affords any other person the benefit of any net operating
loss, net capital loss, investment Tax credit, foreign Tax credit, charitable
deduction or any other credit or Tax attribute that could reduce Taxes
(including deductions and credits related to alternative minimum Taxes) of
ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries, or (iii) requires or permits the transfer
or assignment of income, revenues, receipts or gains to ALARIS or any of its
subsidiaries, from any other person.



(c) ALARIS has not constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of this
Agreement (or will constitute such a corporation in the two years prior
to the Closing Date) or (ii) in a distribution that otherwise constitutes
part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.



(d) ALARIS and its subsidiaries have withheld and paid all Taxes required
to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to
any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third
party, except for Taxes the failure of which to withhold or pay would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material.



(e) None of ALARIS foreign subsidiaries has been a member of any group that
has filed a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return, other than such Tax
Returns for which the period of assessment has expired (taking into account
any extension or waiver thereof).

 



(f) None of ALARIS foreign subsidiaries is (i) engaged in a United States
trade or business for United States federal income tax purposes, (ii) a
"passive foreign investment company" (within the meaning of Section 1297 of
the Code) or a shareholder, directly or indirectly, in a passive foreign
investment company, or (iii) a "foreign investment company" (within the
meaning of Section 1246(b) of the Code).



 

24 (g) " _Tax Returns_ " means returns, reports and forms required to be filed
with any Governmental Authority of the United States or any other
jurisdiction responsible for the imposition or collection of Taxes.



(h) " _Taxes_ " means (i) all taxes (whether United States federal, state or
local or foreign) based upon or measured by income and any other tax
whatsoever, including gross receipts, profits, sales, use, occupation, value
added, _ad valorem_ , transfer, franchise, withholding, payroll, employment,
excise, or property taxes, together with any interest or penalties imposed
with respect thereto, and (ii) any obligations under any agreements or
arrangements with respect to any taxes described in clause (i) above.



5.13. _Intellectual Property_.



(a) Set forth in Section 5.13 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule is a true and
accurate list, of (i) all of ALARIS and its subsidiaries items of
Intellectual Property (as defined below) consisting of foreign and domestic

27 (c) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified (within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code) has been amended to reflect changes in law referred to as
"GUST" and has received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service that such plan is so qualified (a " _Qualified Plan_ "), and all

(e) Except as set forth in Section 5.15(e) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule,
ALARIS and its ERISA Affiliates have complied, and are now in compliance,
in all material respects, with all provisions of Applicable Laws, including
ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations (including any local Applicable
Laws) applicable to the Plans. Except as set forth in Section 5.15(e) to the
ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, each Plan has been operated in material
compliance with its terms. There is not now, and there are no existing
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to give rise to, any
requirement for the posting of security with respect to a Plan or the
imposition of any pledge, lien, security interest or encumbrance on the assets
of ALARIS or any of its ERISA Affiliates under ERISA or the Code, or similar
Applicable Laws of foreign jurisdictions.



(f) Except as set forth in Section 5.15(f) to the ALARIS Disclosure
Schedule, no Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section

of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that
has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control (within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA) (a " _Multiple
Employer Plan_ "), nor has ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries or any of their

regard to any funding waiver). Neither ALARIS nor any of its ERISA Affiliates
is required to provide security to any Plan pursuant to Section 307 of ERISA
or Section 501(a) of the Code. Since its last valuation date, there have been
no amendments to such Plan that materially increase the present value of

28 a liability of ALARIS or any of its ERISA Affiliates following the Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither ALARIS nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069
of ERISA.

could reasonably be expected to promise or to guarantee such employees retiree
health or life insurance benefits or other retiree death benefits on a
permanent basis.



(i) Except as disclosed in Section 5.15(i) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result in, cause the

payment or benefit to any employee, officer, director or consultant of ALARIS
or any of its ERISA Affiliates (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth
in Section 5.15(i) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, no amount paid or
payable by ALARIS or any of its ERISA Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either solely as a result thereof
or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
conjunction with any other events, will be an "excess parachute payment"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code). Section 5.15(i) to the
ALARIS Disclosure Schedule sets forth the maximum aggregate amount of any
such excess parachute payments.



(j) Except as disclosed in Section 5.15(j) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule,
there are no pending, or, to the knowledge of ALARIS, threatened, claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) that have been
asserted or instituted against any Plan, any fiduciaries thereof with respect
to their duties to any Plan or the assets of any of the trusts under any Plan
that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of
ALARIS or any of its ERISA Affiliates to the Pension Benefit Guaranty

Department of Labor, or to comparable entities or Plans under Applicable Laws
of jurisdictions outside the United States.

the date specified thereon, of the assets (if any) set aside in any grantor
trust(s) to fund such liabilities. Except as disclosed in Section 5.15(k) to

current or former properties or operations; and (d) there has been no
material exposure of any person or property to any Hazardous Material in
connection with the current or former properties, operations and activities of
ALARIS and its subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 5.21 to the ALARIS
Disclosure Schedule, neither ALARIS nor its subsidiaries has knowledge of or
has received notice of any past, present or future events, conditions,
circumstances, activities, practices, incidents, actions or plans which may
interfere with or prevent compliance or continued compliance by ALARIS or its
subsidiaries with any Environmental Laws or any order, decree, judgment,
injunction, notice or demand letter issued, entered, promulgated or approved
thereunder or which may give rise to any common law or legal liability, or
otherwise form the basis of any Action, demand or study, based on or related
to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage,
disposal, transport, or handling, or the emission, discharge, release
or threatened release into the environment, of any pollutant, contaminant,
chemical, or industrial, toxic or hazardous substance or waste. "
_Environmental Laws_ " means all United States federal, state or local or
foreign laws relating to pollution or protection of human health or the
environment (including ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface
or subsurface strata), including laws relating to emissions, discharges,
releases or threatened releases of chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, or
industrial, toxic or hazardous substances or wastes (collectively, "
_Hazardous Materials_ ") into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal,
transport or handling of Hazardous Materials, as well as all authorizations,



 

34 codes, decrees, demands or demand letters, injunctions, judgments, licenses,
notices, orders, permits, plans or regulations issued, entered, promulgated
or approved thereunder. " _Environmental Permit_ " means any permit, approval,
grant, consent, exemption, certificate, order, easement, variance, franchise,
license or other authorization required under or issued pursuant to any
applicable Environmental Laws.



5.22. _Insurance_. Section 5.22 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule lists all
material insurance policies and binders and programs of self-insurance owned,
held or maintained by ALARIS on the date of this Agreement or at any time
during the previous three calendar years that afford or afforded, as the case
may be, coverage to ALARIS, its assets or businesses. Except as set forth in
Section 5.22 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule, ALARIS and its subsidiaries
presently are insured and during each of the past three calendar years have
been insured against such risks as companies engaged in a similar business
would, in accordance with good business practice, customarily be insured.
ALARIS insurance policies are in all material respects in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms, no notice of cancellation has been
received, and there is no existing material default or event that, with the
giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
thereunder. Such insurance policies are in all material respects in amounts
that are customary, adequate and suitable in relation to the business, assets
and liabilities of ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries and all premiums to date
have been paid in full. ALARIS or any of its covered subsidiaries is a "named
insured" or an "insured" under such insurance policies. ALARIS and its
subsidiaries have not been refused any insurance, nor has the coverage of
ALARIS or any of its subsidiaries been limited, by any insurance carrier to
which it has applied for insurance or with which it has carried insurance
during the past three years. Except as set forth in Section 5.22 to the ALARIS
Disclosure Schedule, the policies of fire, theft, liability and other
insurance maintained with respect to the assets or businesses of ALARIS and
its subsidiaries provide adequate coverage against loss, and may be continued
by ALARIS and its subsidiaries without modification or premium increase after
the Effective Time and for the duration of their current terms, which terms
expire as set forth in Section 5.22 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule. Set
forth in Section 5.22 to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule is the amount of the
annual premium currently paid by ALARIS for its directors and officers
liability insurance.



5.23. _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The ALARIS Board has received the
opinions, such opinions to be confirmed in writing dated the date of
this Agreement, of each of ALARIS Financial Advisors to the effect that, as
of the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be received by the ALARIS
Stockholders pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to the ALARIS
Stockholders (other than ALARIS Majority Stockholder) from a financial point
of view, ALARIS has provided a copy of each such opinion to Cardinal Health,
and each such opinion has not been withdrawn or revoked or otherwise modified
in any material respect. ALARIS has received the consent of each of ALARIS
Financial Advisors to include such written opinion in the Offer Documents, the
Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement.



5.24. _Board Recommendation; Required Vote_. The ALARIS Board, at a meeting
duly called and held, has, by unanimous vote of those directors present (who
constituted 100% of the directors then in office), (a) approved this
Agreement, and deem this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement advisable, fair to and in the best interests
of the ALARIS Stockholders; (b) approved this Agreement, the Support



 

35 Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Support
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, in all respects, and such
approval constitutes approval of the Offer, this Agreement, the Merger, the
Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated by such agreements for
purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL; and (c) resolved to recommend that the
ALARIS Stockholders accept the Offer, that the ALARIS Stockholders tender
their shares of ALARIS Common Stock under the Offer to Subcorp, and that the
ALARIS Stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger to
the extent required by Applicable Laws (the " _ALARIS Board Recommendation_
"). The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
ALARIS Common Stock to adopt this Agreement is the only vote of the holders of
any class or series of ALARIS Common Stock necessary to adopt this Agreement
and approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no vote of any holders of any class or
series of ALARIS capital stock is necessary to adopt this Agreement or
approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the event that
Cardinal Health or Subcorp shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding
ALARIS Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, other than, subject to the
satisfaction of or, to the extent permitted under this Agreement, waiver of
all conditions to the Merger, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.



5.25. _Section 203 of the DGCL_. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the
ALARIS Board has taken all action necessary to exempt under or make not
subject to (a) the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, (b) any other state
takeover law or state law that purports to limit or restrict business
combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares or (c) any provision of
the ALARIS Certificate or the ALARIS By-laws (including Article II Section 10
of the ALARIS By-Laws) that would require any corporate approval other than
that otherwise required by the DGCL: (i) the execution of this Agreement and
the Support Agreement, (ii) the Offer, (iii) the Merger and (iv) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Support Agreement.



ARTICLE VI



COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES



The parties hereto agree that:



6.1. _Mutual Covenants_.



(a) _HSR Act Filings; Reasonable Efforts; Notification_.



(i) Each of Cardinal Health and ALARIS shall (A) make or cause to be made the
filings required of such party hereto or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates
under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event within seven business
days after the date of this Agreement, (B) comply at the earliest practicable
date with any request under the HSR Act for additional information, documents,
or other materials received by such party hereto or any of its subsidiaries
from the United States Federal Trade Commission or the United States
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority in respect of such
filings or such transactions, and (C) cooperate with the other party in
connection with any such filing (including, with respect



 

36 to the party hereto making a filing, providing copies of all such documents to
the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to
accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry
of any such agency or other Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws
(as defined in Section 6.1(a)(ii)) with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. Each party hereto shall use all reasonable best efforts to
furnish to each other all information required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to any Applicable Laws in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
hereto shall promptly inform the other parties hereto of any
communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking, or agreement
with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such
transaction. No party hereto shall independently participate in any meeting,
or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving
the other party hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another,
in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf
of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Each of the parties hereto will use all
reasonable best efforts to secure termination of any waiting periods under the
HSR Act and obtain the approval of any other Governmental Authority for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Cardinal Health and ALARIS may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.1 "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Cardinal Health or ALARIS, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel.



(ii) Each of Cardinal Health and ALARIS shall use all reasonable efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States
federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In
connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Laws, each of Cardinal Health and
ALARIS shall cooperate and use all reasonable efforts vigorously to contest
and resist any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed,
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by vigorously pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal unless, by mutual
agreement, Cardinal Health and ALARIS decide that litigation is not in their
respective best interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.1(a) shall limit a
party heretos right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, so
long as such party hereto has, up to then, complied in all



 

37 material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.1(a). Each of
Cardinal Health and ALARIS shall use all reasonable efforts to take such
action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under
the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible after the execution of
this Agreement.



(iii) Each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (A) the obtaining of
all other necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses,
permits, authorizations, orders and approvals from Governmental Authorities
and the making of all other necessary registrations and filings (including
other filings with Governmental Authorities, if any), (B) the obtaining of
all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties related to or required
in connection with the Offer and the Merger that are necessary to consummate
the Offer and the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or required to prevent a Material Adverse Effect on ALARIS from occurring
prior to or after the Effective Time, and (C) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.
Additionally, each of Cardinal Health and ALARIS shall use all reasonable
efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Offer (as set forth in
Annex A) and to the Merger.



(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A) neither
Cardinal Health nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any of their respective
businesses or assets, or to take or agree to take any action or agree to
any limitation with respect to the ownership or holding of any of their
respective businesses or assets, (B) prior to the Effective Time, neither
ALARIS nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any of their respective
businesses or assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to
any limitation with respect to the ownership or holding of any of their
respective businesses or assets, (C) neither any party hereto nor their
respective subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that would, or
would reasonably be expected to, substantially impair the benefits expected,
as of the date of this Agreement, to be realized by Cardinal Health from
consummation of the Offer and the Merger, (D) neither Cardinal Health nor
Subcorp shall be required to waive any of the conditions of the Offer set
forth in Annex A, and (E) no party hereto shall be required to waive any of
the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII as they apply to such
party.



(b) _Public Announcements_. The initial press release concerning the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press
release. Cardinal Health, Subcorp and ALARIS will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the United States federal securities laws including
by filing the initial press release and other such communications as are
required to be filed with the Commission. Unless otherwise required by
Applicable Laws or requirements of the NYSE (and, in that event, only if time
does not permit), at all times prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, Cardinal Health and
ALARIS shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with
respect to the Offer,



 

38 the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not
issue any such press release prior to such consultation which consultation
shall provide the other a reasonable opportunity to comment. __



(c) _Conveyance Taxes._ ALARIS and Cardinal Health shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp
taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar
Taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Time.



6.2. _Covenants of Cardinal Health_.



(a) _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.



(i) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
Cardinal Health shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, hold
harmless and advance expenses to the present and former officers and directors
of ALARIS in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time to the extent provided under the ALARIS Certificate or the ALARIS By-
laws as in effect on the date of this Agreement; and



(ii) Cardinal Health shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Cardinal Health
to obtain and maintain in effect, for a period of six years after the
Effective Time, policies of directors and officers liability insurance
covering each person who was covered under such policies as of the date of
this Agreement and immediately prior to the Appointment Time at no cost to
the beneficiaries thereof with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time with substantially the same coverage and containing
substantially similar terms and conditions as existing policies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Surviving Corporation nor Cardinal Health shall
be required to pay an aggregate premium for such insurance coverage in excess
of 200% of the amount calculated as set forth in Section 5.22 to the ALARIS
Disclosure Schedule, but, in such case, shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount and that the Surviving Corporation or
Cardinal Health may substitute therefor other policies not less advantageous
(excluding _de minimis_ differences) to the beneficiaries of the current
policies and _provided_ that such substitution shall not result in any gaps or
lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time.



(b) _Employees and Employee Benefits_.



(i) For purposes of this Section 6.2(b), " _ALARIS Employees_ " means
individuals who are, as of the Effective Time, employees of ALARIS and its
subsidiaries not subject to collective bargaining agreements.



(ii) Cardinal Health shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the ALARIS
Employees eligible to participate in Cardinal Health employee benefit plans
as of a date to be mutually determined by Cardinal Health and ALARIS (the "
_Eligibility Date_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the
Effective Time and until the Eligibility Date, Cardinal Health shall provide
ALARIS Employees with employee benefit plans, programs, contracts or
arrangements that, in the aggregate, will provide benefits that are not
materially less favorable in



 

39 the aggregate than the benefits provided to such ALARIS Employees under the
Plans (except for Plans providing equity or equity-based compensation) in
effect on the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of such
employee benefit plans, programs, contracts or arrangements, it being
understood that, except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, the
foregoing shall not require Cardinal Health or the Surviving Corporation to
maintain any particular Plan. Cardinal Health agrees that the ALARIS Employees
will not be treated as "new" employees for purposes of any exclusions or
waiting periods under any health or similar plan of Cardinal Health or any
subsidiary of Cardinal Health for a preexisting medical condition, and will
make appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to assure such
result ( _provided, however_ , that such treatment shall not apply to a
preexisting condition of any ALARIS Employee who was, as of the Effective
Time, excluded from participation in a Plan by virtue of such preexisting
condition and _provided, further_ , that any ALARIS Employee whose credited
service with ALARIS would still subject him or her to an exclusion or waiting
period if such service were treated as service with Cardinal Health shall be
subject to the exclusion or waiting period until he or she has sufficient
aggregate service with Cardinal Health and ALARIS).



(iii) With respect to matters described in this Section 6.2(b) relating to
benefits or compensation to be provided after the Effective Time and with
respect to the effect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
ALARIS employee benefits and compensation, ALARIS will, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Laws, provide Cardinal Health with copies of any
notices or other communication materials prior to sending them and permit
Cardinal Health a right of reasonable consent to such notices or materials.



6.3.  _Covenants of ALARIS_.



(a) _Conduct of ALARIS  Operations_. ALARIS shall conduct its operations in
the ordinary course, except as expressly contemplated below by this Section
6.3(a) and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall use all
reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve its business organization and its
material rights and franchises and accreditation status and to retain the
services of its officers and key employees and maintain relationships with
customers, suppliers, lessees, licensees and other third parties, and to
maintain all of its operating assets in their current condition (normal wear
and tear excepted), to the end that their goodwill and ongoing business shall
not be impaired in any material respect. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, ALARIS shall not, except as otherwise expressly contemplated
by this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as
set forth in Section 6.3(a) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule or as expressly
permitted by another clause of this Section 6.3(a), without the prior written

or the securities of its subsidiaries: (A) adjust, split, combine or
reclassify ALARIS capital stock or that of its subsidiaries, (B) make, declare

subsidiaries, other than dividends or distributions by any wholly
owned subsidiaries of ALARIS to ALARIS or to a wholly owned, United States-
based subsidiary of ALARIS, (C) grant any person any right or option to
acquire



 

40 any shares of ALARIS capital stock or that of its subsidiaries, except for the
grant, in the aggregate of options to purchase up to 5,000 shares of ALARIS
Common Stock, (D) issue, deliver or sell or agree to issue, deliver or sell
any additional shares of ALARIS capital stock or any securities or obligations
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of ALARIS
capital stock or such securities (except pursuant to the exercise of ALARIS
Options that are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement or for the
grant, in the aggregate, of options to purchase up to 5,000 shares of ALARIS
Common Stock pursuant to subclause (C) above) or the capital stock or such
securities of its subsidiaries, or (E) enter into any agreement, understanding
or arrangement with respect to the sale, voting, registration or repurchase
of ALARIS capital stock or that of its subsidiaries;



(ii) directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, lease, pledge, mortgage, encumber

laws;

benefits provided to, or pay any amounts not otherwise due to, any
officer, director, consultant or employee, except as may be required by
Applicable Laws or agreements existing on the date of this Agreement, or
grant, reprice, or accelerate the exercise or payment of any ALARIS Options or
other equity-based awards, except for the grant, in the aggregate, of options
to purchase up to 5,000 shares of ALARIS Common Stock;



(ix) enter into, adopt or amend any Plan (or any new arrangement that would
constitute a Plan), except as shall be required by Applicable Laws;

officer or director of ALARIS as a result of the consummation of any of the

post-consummation termination of employment);



(xi) change any method or principle of Tax or financial accounting, except to

Section 203 of the DGCL or (B) any other state takeover law or state law that
purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire
or vote shares, any individual or entity (other than Cardinal Health or its
subsidiaries), or any action taken thereby, which individual, entity

it shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its subsidiaries or any
of its or its subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, agents or
representatives, directly or indirectly, to: (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, or knowingly furnish or
otherwise disclose nonpublic information in furtherance of, any inquiries or
the making of any proposal with respect to any recapitalization, merger,
consolidation or other business combination involving ALARIS, or acquisition
of any capital stock from ALARIS (other than upon exercise of ALARIS Options
that are (i) outstanding as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) permitted to
be granted under the terms of this Agreement) or ALARIS Majority Stockholder
or the ALARIS Stockholders generally or a material amount of the assets of
ALARIS and any of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction
or a series of related transactions not in the ordinary course of business,
or any acquisition by ALARIS of any material assets or capital stock of any
other person not in the ordinary course of business, or any combination of the
foregoing (a " _Competing Transaction_ "), or (ii) negotiate or otherwise
engage in discussions with any person (other than Cardinal Health, Subcorp or
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives)
with respect to any Competing Transaction or potential Competing Transaction
or (iii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it
to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however,_ in each
case, that, at any time prior to the Appointment Time, ALARIS may furnish or
otherwise disclose information to, and negotiate or otherwise engage in
discussions with, any individual or entity that delivers a written proposal
for a Competing Transaction that was not solicited, knowingly encouraged or
knowingly facilitated after the date of this Agreement if and so long as the
ALARIS Board (A) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failing to take such action is reasonably likely to cause
the ALARIS Board to violate its fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws and (B)
determines, after consultation with ALARIS Financial Advisors (or any other
nationally recognized investment banking firm), that such a proposal is or is
reasonably likely to lead to a transaction that is more favorable to the
ALARIS Stockholders (determined without regard to the Support Agreement in the
case of ALARIS Majority Stockholder) from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the
terms and conditions proposed in writing to ALARIS by Cardinal Health in
response to such Competing Transaction) taking into account, among other
things, the likelihood and anticipated timing of consummation and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal of



 

43 the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the parties hereto (any
proposal with respect to which the ALARIS Board has made the determination
described in clause (B), a " _Superior Proposal_ "), _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, prior to furnishing or otherwise disclosing any information to such
individual or entity, ALARIS shall enter into a confidentiality agreement
that is no less restrictive, in any respect, than the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that any confidentiality agreements
described in Section 6.3(b) to the ALARIS Disclosure Schedule (a true and
complete copy of which shall be provided to Cardinal Health) shall be deemed
to satisfy this requirement. ALARIS immediately will cease all existing
activities, discussions and negotiations with any individual or entity
conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal for a Competing Transaction
and request the return of all confidential information regarding ALARIS
provided to any such individual or entity prior to the date of this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreements or otherwise. In the
event that, prior to the Appointment Time, the ALARIS Board after consultation
with its outside legal counsel determines that failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to cause the ALARIS Board to violate its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Laws, the ALARIS Board may (subject to this and the following
sentences) withdraw, modify or change, in a manner adverse to Cardinal Health,
the ALARIS Board Recommendation and/or comply with Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act, _provided_ that ALARIS gives Cardinal Health at least 24-hours
prior written notice of its intention to do so ( _provided_ that the foregoing
shall in no way limit or otherwise affect Cardinal Healths right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)). Any such withdrawal,
modification or change of the ALARIS Board Recommendation shall not change the
approval of the ALARIS Board for purposes of causing any state takeover
statute or other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger, or the
Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated by such agreements. From
and after the execution of this Agreement, ALARIS shall immediately advise
Cardinal Health in writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any
inquiries or proposals or participation in discussions or negotiations,
relating to a Competing Transaction (including the specific terms thereof and
the identity of the other individual or entity or individuals or entities
involved) and immediately furnish to Cardinal Health a copy of any such
written proposal in addition to a copy of any information provided to or by
any third party relating thereto. In addition, ALARIS shall immediately
advise Cardinal Health, in writing, if the ALARIS Board shall make any
determination as to any Competing Transaction as contemplated by the proviso
to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(b). Nothing contained in this
Section 6.3(b) or any other provision of this Agreement shall prohibit ALARIS
from, at any time, taking and disclosing to the ALARIS Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or making any disclosure required by Rule
14a-9 under the Exchange Act so long as the requirements set forth in this
Section 6.3(b) are satisfied.



(c) _Fiduciary Right of Termination._ If, prior to the Appointment Time, the
ALARIS Board shall determine in good faith, after consultation with ALARIS
Financial Advisors and ALARIS legal advisors, that any unsolicited written
proposal from a third party for a Competing Transaction received after the
date of this Agreement continues to be a Superior Proposal and the ALARIS
Board has determined, following consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to enter into such a Competing Transaction would be
reasonably likely to cause the ALARIS Board to violate its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Laws, ALARIS may terminate this Agreement and enter
into a letter of intent, agreement-in-principle, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") with respect to
such 



 

44 Competing Transaction, _provided_ , ALARIS shall have at all times after the
date of this Agreement complied with the provisions of Section 6.2(b) and
_provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to any such termination:



(i) ALARIS has provided Cardinal Health written notice that it intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i), identifying the
Competing Transaction then determined to be a Superior Proposal and the
parties thereto and delivering a copy of the Acquisition Agreement and any
ancillary agreements each in the form to be entered into; and



(ii) within three full business days after ALARIS has provided the notice
referred to in Section 6.3(c)(i), Cardinal Health does not make a written
offer that the ALARIS Board concludes in good faith (following consultation
with ALARIS Financial Advisors (or any other nationally
recognized investment banking firm) and outside legal counsel) is as
favorable to the ALARIS Stockholders as the Competing Transaction then
determined to be a Superior Proposal.



(d) _Access_. ALARIS shall permit representatives of Cardinal Health to have
appropriate access at all reasonable times to ALARIS premises, properties,
books, records, contracts, documents, customers and suppliers. Cardinal Health
will keep the information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.3(d)
confidential pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, and
shall cause its directors, officers and employees and representatives or
advisors who receive any portion thereof to keep all such information
confidential, except as may otherwise be required by Applicable Laws. No
investigation conducted pursuant to this Section 6.3(d) shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made in this Agreement.



(e) _Subsequent Financial Statements_. After the date of this Agreement,
ALARIS shall provide to Cardinal Health drafts of any draft ALARIS
SEC Documents a reasonable time prior to filing and shall consult with, and
provide an opportunity to comment to, Cardinal Health prior to filing any
ALARIS SEC Document or making publicly available its financial results for any
period.



6.4. _Section 203 of the DGCL Covenant_. Cardinal Health covenants and agrees
that, notwithstanding the fact that the ALARIS Board approved this Agreement
and the Support Agreement for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL, in the
event that Cardinal Health, Subcorp or their respective affiliates acquire the
shares of ALARIS Common Stock owned by ALARIS Majority Stockholder or
affiliates of ALARIS Majority Stockholder and either (i) Subcorp does not
consummate the Offer and accept for payment and pay for all of the shares of
ALARIS common stock validly tendered and not withdrawn or (ii) the Merger
Agreement is terminated, Cardinal Health and its affiliates shall be subject
to the limitations of Section 203 of the DGCL to the same extent they would
have been subject to the limitations of Section 203 if the ALARIS Board had
not approved the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement.

right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not be

perform any material covenant or obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of or resulted in the failure of the Appointment Time to occur on or

the Offer shall have expired or been terminated in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement without Cardinal Health or Subcorp having accepted for
purchase any shares of ALARIS Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, other
than by reason of a breach of this Agreement by the terminating party;



(f) by Cardinal Health, prior to the Appointment Time, if ALARIS Majority

action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at
any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the ALARIS
Stockholders, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made that by
law requires further approval or authorization by the ALARIS Stockholders
without such further approval or authorization. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may not be amended, except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.



8.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal
Health and Subcorp (with respect to ALARIS) and ALARIS (with respect to

hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties

of any material portion of the businesses or assets of ALARIS or, after giving
