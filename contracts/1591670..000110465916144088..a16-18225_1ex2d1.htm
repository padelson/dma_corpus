share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time, other than shares of Company Common Stock to be

pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_, the " **Exchange Ratio** ") validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " **Merger
Consideration** "), without interest, but subject to any withholding required
under applicable tax Law, plus the right, if any, to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.7_, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock into

(d) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. As of the Company Merger Effective

respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding after the

Time, have become fully earned and fully vested under the terms of the
applicable award agreements relating to each such RSU Award (as the same
exists on the date hereof), shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of Company Common stock underlying the earned and vested portion of the

Time, the Company and Parent agree that the Company shall, and shall be
permitted under this Agreement to, take all corporate action necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.1(g)_. Unless Parent otherwise

Merger Effective Time, the Company Equity Incentive Plan shall terminate and
no further stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units,
restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, cash-based awards,
performance share awards, dividend equivalent rights, LTIP units or other
equity-based awards or other rights with respect to shares of the Companys

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time (including any Partnership OP Units held by the Company) shall

(" **New OP Units** ") in an amount equal to the Exchange Ratio, and each
holder of New OP Units shall be admitted as a limited partner of Parent OP
following the Partnership Merger Effective Time in accordance with the terms
of the Parent Partnership Agreement. No fractional New OP Units will be issued
in the Partnership Merger. Any fractional New OP Unit that would otherwise be
issued to any holder of Partnership OP Units shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole number and the holders of Partnership OP Units shall not be
entitled to any further consideration with respect thereto.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as possible after the Company Merger
Effective Time (but in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter),
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_: (i) a letter of transmittal (a " **Letter of
Transmittal** ") which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the Exchange Agent only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, which Letter
of Transmittal shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree upon, and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement, together with any amounts payable in respect of the
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.7_ and dividends

Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with customary exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.3_, each Certificate shall be deemed, at any time after the Company Merger
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate
or in respect of Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration or the
Fractional Share Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares or on any distributions to which holders of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_
hereof.

of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_ or
distribution to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_)
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. In
lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall
automatically upon the Company Merger Effective Time be entitled to receive,
and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Company Merger Effective Time (but in no
event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Merger Consideration,
together with any amounts payable in respect of the Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_ and any distribution to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_ (less required
withholdings as provided in _Section 3.5_) for each Book-Entry Share. Payment
of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and distributions
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 



 

(e) _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Company Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by
Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in
each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject
to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the holder
thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Company Merger Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Company Merger
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. At the Company
Merger Effective Time, holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company other than the
right to receive the Merger Consideration provided under this _Article III_.
The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock (or automatically in the case of
Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any Fractional Share Consideration and any applicable dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock) which remains
undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for six (6)
months after the Company Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock prior to
the Company Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_
shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof for
payment of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Buyer Parties, the Company Parties, the
Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee, director, agent or
Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of the Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of,
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of
such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Parent, on a daily basis. Any
net profit resulting from, or interest or other income produced by, such
investments shall be paid to Parent. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall
relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, replace or
restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other
events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at
a level sufficient to make such payments in accordance with _Section 3.3(c)_.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such

 



       
 

 



 

Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, to the extent required by
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article
III_.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parties, each of their
respective Representatives and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and Fractional
Share Consideration (and any other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement or deemed paid for Tax purposes), such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by any of the Buyer Parties, their respective Representatives or
the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by such Buyer Party,
Representative, or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights, or
rights of objecting stockholders under Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL, shall
be available with respect to the Mergers or other transactions contemplated
hereby, including any remedy under Sections 3-201 et seq. of the MGCL.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Company Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the VWAP of
Parent Common Stock.

and correct copies of all written correspondence between the SEC and the
Company. Except as set forth in _Section 4.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, each of the Company Parties has, since October 23, 2015, filed with
or otherwise furnished to (as applicable) the SEC on a timely basis all
reports, schedules, forms, registration statements, definitive proxy
statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it under
the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the " **Securities Laws** "), together
with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
as amended (the " **Sarbanes-Oxley Act** ") (such documents, together with any
documents and information incorporated therein by reference, collectively, the
" **Company SEC Reports** "), all of which were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Laws applicable
to "Emerging Growth Companies" (as such term is defined in the Securities
Act). At all times since the initial confidential submission of the
registration statement on Form S-11 in connection with the Companys initial
public offering, the Company has satisfied and satisfies all requirements to
qualify as an "Emerging Growth Company" as defined in the Securities Act.
Except for matters relating to open comment letters with the SEC as set forth
in _Section 4.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of their
respective dates, the Company SEC Reports

 



      
 

 



 

(other than preliminary materials) (a) complied (or with respect to Company
SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will comply) as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Laws applicable to
Emerging Growth Companies and (b) at the time of filing or being furnished (or
effectiveness in the case of registration statements) did not (or with respect
to Company SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will not) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
to the extent such statements have been modified or superseded by later
Company SEC Reports filed or furnished and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement and provided that no representation or warranty is made
hereunder as to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement that were not supplied by or on behalf of the
Company or the Partnership. Neither the Company nor the Partnership has any
outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to the Company
SEC Reports. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of its date
and each of the consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash
flows of the Company included in or incorporated by reference into the Company
SEC Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations, retained earnings or cash flows,
as the case may be, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP and the
applicable rules, accounting requirements and regulations of the SEC
consistently applied during the periods involved, except to the extent such
financial statements have been modified or superseded by later Company SEC
Reports, and except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by
Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act and pursuant to Sections
13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and for normal year-end audit adjustments

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement, including any contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or such Companys or Company Subsidiarys
audited financial statements or other Company SEC Reports.

 



 

(c) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports or as set forth in _Section
4.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no liabilities of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary of a nature that would be required under
GAAP to be set forth on the financial statements of the Company or the notes
thereto, other than liabilities (i) adequately provided for on the balance
sheet of the Company dated as of June 30, 2016 (including the notes thereto)
as required by GAAP, (ii) incurred under this Agreement or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) that will be discharged or paid in

(d) Since the end of the Companys most recent audited fiscal year, there have
been no significant deficiencies or material weakness in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated) and no
change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company is not aware
of any change in its internal control over financial reporting that has
occurred during its most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control
over financial reporting. Since October 23, 2015, (x) the Company has designed
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to the Company and required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, (y) to the Companys Knowledge, such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of the Company to material information
relating to the Company required to be included in the reports the Company is
required to file under the Exchange Act, and (z) the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the
Companys independent registered public accounting firm and the audit
committee of the Company Board (and made summaries of such disclosures
available to Parent) (A) all known significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (B) any known fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. As of the
date of this Agreement, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder, and the statements contained in all such certifications were, as
of their respective dates made, complete and correct in all material respects.

Governmental Authority which, in the case of (a) or (b), individually or in
the aggregate, (i) would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Mergers, (ii) otherwise would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay performance by the Company of any of its
material obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) have, or would reasonably
be expected to have, a material adverse impact on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of the Company Properties.

compensation or forgiveness of indebtedness, or accelerate the time of payment
or vesting or trigger any payment of funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or

any Law applicable to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of its respective
properties or assets, excluding from the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and

violations, breaches or defaults which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, (A) reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Mergers, (B) otherwise prevent or materially delay
performance by the Parent or Parent OP of its material obligations under this
Agreement or (C) have, or reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Since inception, none of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary has been, or is in, violation of, or has been given
written notice of or been charged with any violation of, any Law applicable to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary is bound (except for Laws addressed in _Section 5.12_,
_Section 5.13_ or _Section 5.21_, which shall be governed solely by such
Sections), except for any such violations that have been cured, or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Except for Permits that are the subject of _Section
5.12_ and _Section 5.13_, which are addressed solely in those Sections,

registrations, certificates, orders, waivers, clearances and variances
necessary to conduct Parents or a Parent Subsidiarys business, as

Subsidiary has received written notice that any Permit will be terminated or

Section 5.8 _SEC Reports, Financial Statements and Internal Controls_.

 



 

(a) Parent has made available to the Company on the Parent Datasite complete
and correct copies of all written correspondence between the SEC and Parent.
Except as set forth in _Section 5.8(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
each of the Buyer Parties has, since April 10, 2014, filed with or otherwise
furnished to (as applicable) the SEC on a timely basis all reports, schedules,
forms, registration statements, definitive proxy statements and other
documents required to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Laws,
together with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
(such documents, together with any documents and information incorporated
therein by reference, collectively, the " **Parent SEC Reports** "), all of
which were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Laws applicable to "Emerging Growth Companies"
(as such term is defined in the Securities Act). At all times since the
initial confidential submission of the registration statement on Form S-11 in
connection with Parents initial public offering, Parent has satisfied and
satisfies all requirements to qualify as an "Emerging Growth Company" as
defined in the Securities Act. Except for matters relating to open comment
letters with the SEC as set forth in _Section 5.8(a)_ of Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as of their respective dates, Parent SEC Reports (other than
preliminary materials) (a) complied (or with respect to Parent SEC Reports
filed after the date hereof, will comply) as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Laws applicable to Emerging Growth
Companies and (b) at the

 



       
 

 



 

time of filing or being furnished (or effectiveness in the case of
registration statements) did not (or with respect to Parent SEC Reports filed
after the date hereof, will not) contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent
such statements have been modified or superseded by later Parent SEC Reports
filed or furnished and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement
and provided that no representation or warranty is made hereunder as to
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement that were not supplied by or on behalf of Parent or the
Partnership. Neither Parent nor the Partnership has any outstanding and
unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to Parent SEC Reports. Each of
the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
Parent SEC Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of
income, retained earnings and cash flows of Parent included in or incorporated
by reference into Parent SEC Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of operations,
retained earnings or cash flows, as the case may be, of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance
with GAAP and the applicable rules accounting requirements and regulations of
the SEC consistently applied during the periods involved, except to the extent
such financial statements have been modified or superseded by later Parent SEC
Reports, and except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by
Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act and pursuant to Sections
13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and for normal year-end audit adjustments
which would not be material in amount or effect.

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement, including any contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any
Parent Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K), where the result,
purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary or such Parents or Parent Subsidiarys audited financial
statements or other Parent SEC Reports.

 



 

(c) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports, as set forth in _Section
5.8(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no liabilities of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary of a nature that would be required under GAAP to be
set forth on the financial statements of Parent or the notes thereto, other
than liabilities (i) adequately provided for on the balance sheet of the
Parent dated as of June 30, 2016 (including the notes thereto) as required by
GAAP, (ii) incurred under this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) that will be discharged or paid in
full prior to the Closing Date, or (iv) incurred in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice, subsequent to June 30, 2016.

 



 

(d) Since the end of Parents most recent audited fiscal year, except as set
forth in _Section 5.8(d)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there have been
no significant deficiencies or material weakness in Parents internal control
over financial reporting (whether or

 



      
 

 



 

not remediated) and no change in Parents internal control over financial
reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, Parents internal control over financial reporting. Parent is not
aware of any change in its internal control over financial reporting that has
occurred during its most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Parents internal control over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2016, (x) Parent has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and
communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure, (y) to Parents Knowledge, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of Parent to material
information required to be included in the reports Parent is required to file
under the Exchange Act, and (z) Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to Parents independent registered
public accounting firm and the audit committee of Parent Board (and made
summaries of such disclosures available to the Company) (A) all known
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
Parents internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely
to adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) any known fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting. As
of the date of this Agreement, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of Parent have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder, and the statements contained in all such certifications were, as
of their respective dates made, complete and correct in all material respects.
No Parent Subsidiary is required to file any form or report with the SEC.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Litigation_. Except as set forth in Parent SEC Reports or in
_Section 5.9_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (a) there is no Action
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries, and (b) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor
any of the Parent Properties is subject to any outstanding order, writ,
judgment, injunction, stipulation, award or decree of any Governmental
Authority which, in the case of (a) or (b), individually or in the aggregate,
(i) would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Mergers, (ii) otherwise would reasonably expected to
prevent or materially delay performance by Parent of any of its material
obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) have, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a material adverse impact on Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of the Parent Properties.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement or as disclosed in Parent SEC Reports or in _Section 5.10_ of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, from January 1, 2016 through the date hereof,
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and there has not been: (a) any declaration, setting aside or payment
of any dividend or other distribution with respect to any shares of capital
stock of Parent (other than the regular quarterly dividends to be paid to
holders of Parent Common Stock); (b) any Commitment entered into by Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries outside the ordinary course of business

 



      
 

 



 

except for Commitments for expenses of attorneys, accountants, investment
bankers and other services incurred in connection with the Mergers; (c) any
material change in Parents accounting principles, practices or methods except
insofar as may have been required by a change in GAAP; or (d) any Event that
has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

to any filing extension granted by a Governmental Authority) and (b) has paid
(or had paid on their behalf) all U.S. federal and state income and all other
material Taxes that are required to be paid by it, except, in each case, where
the failure to file such Tax Returns or pay such Taxes would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Parent (i) for all taxable years commencing with its taxable year ending
December 31, 2014 through its taxable year ending December 31, 2015 has been
subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code

action that would reasonably be expected to result in a successful challenge
by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority to its status as a REIT.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.11(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, the most recent financial statements contained in Parent SEC Reports
reflect, to the knowledge of Parent, an adequate reserve for all material
Taxes payable by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, whether or not shown as being due on any Tax Returns.
True, correct, and complete copies of all federal and state income Tax Returns

indirectly owns an interest is a "publicly traded partnership" taxable as a

defined in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code.

 



 

(g) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings ongoing or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened with
regard to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary; (ii) except as set forth in _Section 5.11(g)_ of the Parent

each case, have paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority all
material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the
due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

(n) This _Section 5.11_ contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Buyer Parties with respect to Taxes and Tax matters (other

applicable Law) without the consent of Parent. Unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 9.1_, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its obligation to submit
the approval of the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby to its stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof.

 



 

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parents Governing Documents,
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Parent Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Parent Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , that such record date shall not be more than ninety
(90) days prior to the established date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting.
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of Parent entitled to vote at the
Parent Stockholder Meeting and to hold the Parent Stockholder Meeting as soon
as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Parent shall, through the Parent Board, give the Parent Recommendation,
include the Parent Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and solicit and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval,
except to the extent that the Parent Board shall have made a Change in Parent
Recommendation, as permitted by and determined in accordance with _Section
7.4_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.1(d)_, if,
on a date for which the Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, Parent has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, Parent shall make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Parent Stockholder Meeting solely for the purpose of and
for the times reasonably necessary to solicit additional proxies and votes in
favor of the Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that the Parent
Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than
thirty (30) days after the date for which the Parent Stockholder Meeting was
originally scheduled (excluding any postponements or adjournments required by
applicable Law) without the consent of the Company. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Company Merger to its stockholders
for a vote on the approval thereof.

 



 

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder

 



      
 

 



 

Meeting on the same date and as soon as promptly and reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Other Filings_. In connection with and without limiting the
obligations under _Section 7.1_, as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Partnership each
shall (or shall cause their applicable Subsidiaries to) use their commercially
reasonable efforts to properly prepare and file any other filings required
under the Exchange Act or any other Law relating to the Mergers (including
filings, if any, required under the HSR Act) (collectively, the " **Other
Filings** "). Each of the Parties shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to)
promptly notify the other Parties of the receipt of any comments on, or any
request for amendments or supplements to, any of the Other Filings by the SEC
or any other Governmental Authority or official, and each of the Parties shall
supply the other Parties with copies of all correspondence between it and each
of its Subsidiaries and representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
members of its staff or any other appropriate governmental official, on the
other hand, with respect to any of the Other Filings, except, in each case,
that confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted
from such exchanges. Each of the Parties shall promptly obtain and furnish the
other Parties with (a) the information which may be reasonably required in
order to make such Other Filings and (b) any additional information which may
be requested by a Governmental Authority and which the Parties reasonably deem
appropriate; _provided_ that the Parties may, as they deem advisable and
necessary, designate any sensitive materials provided to the other under this
_Section 7.2_ as "outside counsel only" (in which case such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the Party providing such materials). To the extent reasonably practicable,
neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party prior
notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, without giving the other party the opportunity to attend or
participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such
Governmental Authority.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, but subject to the obligation to act in good faith, and
subject at all times to the Companys and its directors and the Parents and
its directors, as applicable, right and duty to act in a manner consistent
with their duties, each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the Mergers and to cooperate with each
other in connection with the foregoing, including the taking of such actions
as are necessary to obtain any necessary consents, approvals, orders,
exemptions and authorizations by or from any public or private third party,
including, without limitation, any that are required to be obtained under any
Law or any contract, agreement or instrument to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, as applicable, is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound, to
defend all lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Mergers, to effect all necessary registrations and
Other Filings and submissions of information requested by a Governmental
Authority, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be lifted or
rescinded

 



      
 

 



 

any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the
ability of the Parties to consummate the Mergers.

 



 

Section 7.4 _No Solicitations_.

hereof until the earlier of the Company Merger Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_,

shall not authorize any of their respective Representatives to (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of

Confidentiality Agreement, with respect to Company, or a Parent Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, with respect to Parent, as applicable, in each
case, that is entered into in accordance with the terms of this _Section
7.4_, (v) take any action to make any Takeover Statute inapplicable to any
Person or any Acquisition Proposal, other than Parent, its Subsidiaries and
the Mergers, or (vi) propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder
Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval, as applicable, if the Company or
Parent receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited
and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 7.4(a)_, the
Company or Parent, as applicable, may (x) seek to clarify and understand the
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal made by any Person to
determine whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (y) inform such Person that has
made or, to the knowledge of the Company or Parent, as applicable, is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this _Section
7.4_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 7.4(a)_, but
subject to compliance with _Section 7.4(c)_ and _Section 7.4(e)_, if the
Company or Parent receives, following the date hereof but prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting or the Parent Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not
otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 7.4(a)_, then the Company or
Parent, as applicable, may furnish, or cause to be furnished, non-public
information with respect to it and its Subsidiaries to the Person who made
such Acquisition Proposal (a " **Third Party** ") and may participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal only if (i)
the Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable, determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties to the Company or Parent,
as applicable, under applicable Law, (B) the Company Board or Parent Board, as
applicable, determines in good faith (after

 



      
 

 



 

consultation with outside legal and financial advisors) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
and (C) prior to the furnishing of any information to the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal, the Company receives from such Person an executed
Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or Parent receives from such
Person an executed Parent Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, as applicable.
Company or Parent, as applicable, shall provide the other Party with a copy of
any non-public information or data provided to any Third Party pursuant to the
prior sentence prior to or simultaneously with furnishing such information to
such Third Party (except to the extent it has already been provided).

 



 

(c) Each Party shall promptly notify (but in any event within one (1) Business
Day) the other Party orally, and promptly thereafter confirm in writing, of

any Parent Subsidiary, as applicable, by any Person that informs the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, as applicable,
that such Person is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal or request, and the material terms and conditions of any such
proposal or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such
request and shall attach a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal (or
summary of the terms of any oral Acquisition Proposal) and related
documentation that sets forth any terms of such Acquisition Proposal. Each
Party shall also promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, (i)
notify the other Party if it enters into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides non-public information or data
to any Person in accordance with this _Section 7.4(c)_, and (ii) keep the
other Party reasonably apprised in all material respects of the status and
terms of any such proposals, discussions or negotiations on a timely basis,
including by promptly providing copies of documentation or correspondence
relating thereto.

 



 

(d) Except as provided in _Section 7.4(e)_ or _Section 7.4(f)_, and subject
to _Section 9.1(d)_ and _Section 9.1(e)_ hereof, prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval, as applicable,
neither the Company Board, the Parent Board nor any committee thereof, as
applicable, may withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the
other Party, the Company Recommendation or take an action to make a Takeover
Statute inapplicable to any Third Party (a " **Change in Company
Recommendation** ") or the Parent Recommendation or take an action to make a
Takeover Statute inapplicable to any Third Party (a " **Change in Parent
Recommendation** "), respectively.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
compliance with the terms of this _Section 7.4(e)_, the Company Board or the
Parent Board, as applicable, may make a Change in Company Recommendation or a
Change in Parent Recommendation, as applicable (and in the event that the
Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, determines an Acquisition
Proposal to be a Superior Proposal, in accordance with this _Section 7.4_,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1)_, if (i) (A) in the
absence of an Acquisition Proposal, a material development or change in
circumstances (other than, and not related to, an Acquisition Proposal) that
(x) affects the business, assets or operations of the Company or Parent, (y)
was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board or the Parent
Board, as applicable, on the date of this Agreement (assuming consultations
with

 



      
 

 



 

appropriate officers and Representatives of the Company or Parent, as
applicable), and (z) did not result primarily from or arise out of the
announcement or pendency of, or any actions required to be taken pursuant to
(or prohibited by) this Agreement and did not result from a Willful Breach of
this Agreement by the Company or Parent, as applicable, occurs or arises after
the date of this Agreement, which material development or change in
circumstances becomes known to the Company Board or the Parent Board, as
applicable, prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting or the Parent Stockholder
Meeting, as applicable, and (B) the Company Board or the Parent Board, as
applicable, has concluded in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the applicable
directors duties under applicable Law or (ii) if and only if (A) an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company or
Parent, as applicable, and is not withdrawn, (B) the Company Board or the
Parent Board, as applicable, has concluded in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the Company Board or Parent
Board, as applicable, has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
applicable directors duties under applicable Law, (D) three (3) Business Days
(the " **Notice Period** ") shall have elapsed since the Party proposing to
take such action has given written notice to the other Party advising such
Party that the notifying Party intends to take such action and specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including, if applicable, a copy of
the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a " **Notice
of Recommendation Change** "), which Notice of Recommendation Change or the
decision resulting in one shall not be deemed a Change in Company
Recommendation or a Change in Parent Recommendation, as applicable, for any
purpose of this Agreement, (E) during such Notice Period, the notifying Party
shall have negotiated in good faith with the other Party, to the extent the
other Party wishes to negotiate, and (F) the Company Board or the Parent
Board, as applicable, following such Notice Period, again reasonably determine
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel, and taking into
account any proposed adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
irrevocably agreed to by the other Party) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the applicable directors duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any material change in the terms
or conditions of a Superior Proposal that is the subject of a Notice of
Recommendation Change, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to
Parent an additional Notice of Recommendation Change and the Notice Period
shall have recommenced, except that in the event of such recommencement the
"Notice Period" shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days. For the avoidance
of doubt, compliance with this _Section 7.4(e)(ii)_ with respect to a
particular Acquisition Proposal shall not relieve the notifying Party of its
obligation to fully comply with this _Section 7.4(e)_(ii) with respect to any
amended Acquisition Proposal or any other Acquisition Proposal (whether made
by the same or a different Person).

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit either Party or
its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder.

 



 

(g) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees that it will cease
immediately, and cause to be terminated, any and all existing activities,
discussions or

 



      
 

 



 

negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and promptly
request each such Person to return or destroy all confidential information
furnished to such Person on behalf of the Company in connection with any such
actual or potential Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Officers  and Directors Indemnification._

 



 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual Action, whether civil, criminal
or administrative, including, without limitation, any such Action in which any
person who is at the date hereof, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, or who becomes during the period from the date hereof through the date
of the Company Merger Effective Time, a manager, director, officer, trustee,
employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(each, an " **Indemnified Party** " and collectively, the " **Indemnified
Parties** ") and acting in such capacity is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or
(ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, any
agreement or document contemplated hereby or delivered in connection herewith,
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether in any case
asserted or arising at or before or after the Company Merger Effective Time,
the Parties agree, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable
Law, as now or hereinafter in effect, to cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and
agreed that the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, and after the
Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, each Indemnified Party against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any such threatened or actual Action, and in the event of any such
threatened or actual Action (whether asserted or arising at or before or after
the Company Merger Effective Time), (A) the Company and, after the Company
Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall promptly pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such threatened or actual
Action to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties within thirty (30) days
after statements therefor are received, and (C) the Company and, after the
Company Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of
any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); and _provided further_ that the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-
appealable, that indemnification by such entities of such Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section
7.5(a)_, upon learning of any such threatened or actual

 



       
 

 



 

Action, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent thereof; _provided_ that
the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent except to the extent, if any, such failure to
promptly notify materially prejudices such party.

 



 

(b) Each of the Buyer Parties agrees that all rights to indemnification
existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each
Indemnified Party provided for in the respective charters or bylaws (or other
applicable organizational documents) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the
Mergers and continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
from the Company Merger Effective Time and, at the Company Merger Effective
Time, shall become the joint and several obligations of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and any applicable Company Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims (each, a "
**Claim** ") asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Claim. From and after the Company Merger Effective
Time, each of the Buyer Parties also agrees to jointly and severally indemnify
and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Company Merger Effective Time to the extent provided in any written
indemnification agreements between the Company and/or one or more Company
Subsidiaries and such officers and directors as listed in _Section 7.5(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall direct the
Surviving REIT Entity to purchase a non-cancelable extended reporting period
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys
directors and officers in the same form as presently maintained by the
Company, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six
(6) years following the Company Merger Effective Time of not less than the
existing coverage under, and have other terms not less favorable to, the
insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage
presently maintained by the Company as of the date hereof (or if insurance
coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available
coverage); _provided_ , _that_ the Surviving REIT Entity shall not be required
to pay an annual premium therefor in excess of 250% of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date of this Agreement (such 250% amount, the " **Maximum
Premium** "); _provided further_ , _that_ if the annual premiums for such
insurance exceeds the Maximum Premium, Parent shall cause the Surviving REIT
Entity to maintain the most favorable policies of directors and officers
insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.
Parent shall cause the Surviving REIT Entity to maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor all obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this _Section 7.5_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section
7.5_ applies without the consent of each such affected indemnitee. This
_Section 7.5_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third
party beneficiary rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors of Parent and the Surviving REIT Entity. Each of the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this
_Section 7.5_.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) In the event that, following the Company Merger Effective Time, the
Surviving REIT Entity or its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving REIT
Entity or entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person or (iii)
commences a dissolution, liquidation, assignment for the benefit of creditors
or similar action, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving REIT Entity, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.5(e)_.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._

 



 

(a) Between the date hereof and the Company Merger Effective Time, or the
date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section

cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) furnish Company or Parent, as
applicable, with such financial and operating data and other information with
respect to the business, properties, offices, books, contracts, records and
personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries, as applicable, as the Company or Parent, as applicable, may from
time to time reasonably request, (ii) subject to the terms of the Company
Leases, use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate reasonable
access for the Company or Parent, as applicable, and its authorized
representatives (including counsel, financial advisors and auditors) during
normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to all Company
Properties or Parent Properties, as applicable; _provided_ that no
investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any of the representations or warranties made by the Company or Parent,
as applicable, hereto and all such access shall be coordinated through the
Company or Parent, as applicable, or its respective designated
representatives, in accordance with such reasonable procedures as they may
establish.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each of the Buyer Parties
shall hold nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant

accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms contained in that
certain confidentiality agreement between Parent and the Company dated May 27,
2016 (the " **Confidentiality Agreement** "), which shall remain in full force
and effect pursuant to the terms thereof notwithstanding the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the termination thereof.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each of the Company Parties
shall hold nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant

the Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement and, except as otherwise permitted or required
by this Agreement, none of the Company or the Parent shall issue any such
press release or make any such public statement or filing prior to obtaining
the consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a Party may, without
the prior consent of the other Party, issue any such press release or make any
such public statement or filing as may be required by Law, order or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if (i) for any
reason it is not reasonably practicable to consult with the other Party before
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) the Party issuing such
press release or making such public statement has used its reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other Party and to obtain such Partys consent but
has been unable to do so in a timely manner through no fault of such issuing
Party. In this regard, the Parties shall make a joint public announcement of
the Mergers contemplated hereby no later than the opening of trading on the
NYSE on the Business Day following the date on which this Agreement is signed.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Employee Benefit Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee any right
to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving REIT Entity or

rights of Parent, the Surviving REIT Entity or any affiliate of Parent, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Company Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this _Section 7.8_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an
amendment or other modification of any Company Employee Program, or (ii)
create any third party rights in any current or former service provider of the
Company or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



 

(b) After the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving REIT Entity to, honor all obligations under the agreements that are
listed in _Section 7.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts (before and, as relevant, after the Company Merger
Effective Time) to cause the Company Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Provided the Company shall
have received the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section 8.3(e)_ and
Parent shall have received the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section
8.2(e)_, the Parties shall treat the Company Merger as a "reorganization"
under Section 368(a) of the Code and no Party shall take any position for Tax
purposes inconsistent therewith, except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any

 



      
 

 



 

transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax,
" **Transfer Taxes** "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes. Subject to _Article III_, from and after the
Company Merger Effective Time, Company and Partnership (or Parent) shall pay
or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from any consideration
or amounts payable to holders of shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent OP
Units, all Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent, the Surviving REIT Entity, and their Affiliates covenants
and agrees that from and after the Closing it will, or will cause the
Surviving REIT Entity to take all actions, or forbear from taking all actions,
within its control, as necessary to ensure that each of the Company and Parent
will be classified as a REIT for the taxable year of such entity that includes
the Closing Date, and will not take or permit any of its Subsidiaries to take,
within their control, any action which is inconsistent with such REIT
qualification. The Parent and the Company shall cooperate to cause each TRS of
the Parent to jointly elect with the Company to be treated as a TRS of the
Company, effective as of the Closing Date.

Company, the Partnership or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners, managers, members or stockholders, with respect to this

Break-up Fee is payable in accordance with _Section 9.2(b)_ or _Section
9.2(d)_, the rights to payment under _Section 9.2(b)_ or _Section 9.2(d)_,

respective assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers,

Section 9.4 _Payment of Amount or Expense._

 



 

(a) In the event that one Party (the " **Fee Payor** ") is obligated to pay
another Party (the " **Fee Payee** ") the expenses set forth in _Section 9.3_
(collectively, the " **Section 9.3 Amount**"), the Fee Payor shall pay to the
Fee Payee from the Section 9.3 Amount deposited into escrow in accordance with
the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Section 9.3 Amount
and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Fee Payee
without causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A) through (H) or
856(c)(3)(A) through (I) of the Code (" **Qualifying Income** "), as
determined by the Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (2)
in the event the Fee Payee receives either (X) a letter from the Fee Payees
counsel indicating that the Fee Payee has received a ruling from the IRS
described in _Section 9.4(b)_ _(ii)_ or (B) an opinion from the Fee Payees
outside counsel as described in _Section 9.4(b)_ _(ii)_ , an amount equal to
the Section 9.3 Amount less the amount payable under clause (1) above. To
secure the Fee Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the Fee Payor shall
deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Section 9.3 Amount with an
escrow agent selected by the Fee Payor and on such terms (subject to _Section
9.4(b)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the
escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Section 9.3 Amount
pursuant to this _Section 9.4(a)_ shall be made at the time the Fee Payor is
obligated to pay the Fee Payee such amount pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_,
_Section 9.2(c)_ or _Section 9.3_, as applicable, by wire transfer or bank
check.

 



 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Section 9.3 Amount in escrow
or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Fee Payee unless the
escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter
from the Fee Payees independent certified public accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Fee Payee without
causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Fee Payees
accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release
such amount to the Fee Payee, or (ii) a letter from the Fee Payees counsel
indicating that the Fee Payee received a ruling from the IRS holding that the
receipt by the Fee Payee of the Section 9.3 Amount should either constitute
Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, indicating that
the Fee Payees outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect
that the receipt by the Fee Payee of the Section 9.3 Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow
agent shall release the

 



      
 

 



 

remainder of the Section 9.3 Amount to the Fee Payee. The Fee Payor agrees to
amend this _Section 9.4(b)_ at the request of the Fee Payee in order to (x)
maximize the portion of the Section 9.3 Amount that may be distributed to the
Fee Payee hereunder without causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Fee
Payees chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section
9.4(b)_ or (z) assist the Fee Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion
from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 9.4(b)_. The escrow
agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Section 9.3 Amount held
in escrow for five years shall be released by the escrow agent to the Fee
Payor. The Fee Payor shall not be a party to such escrow agreement and shall
not bear any cost of or have liability resulting from the escrow agreement.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties at any time before or after any approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Mergers by the stockholders of the
Company or Parent; provided, however, that after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such
stockholders without obtaining such approval.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other Parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto, and (c) waive compliance by any other Party with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party against which such waiver or
extension is to be enforced. The failure of a Party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.

Section 10.2 _Interpretation_. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Wherever used herein, a pronoun in the
masculine gender shall be considered as including the feminine gender unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_. Except for _Article II_ and _Article III_, _Section 7.5_ and
any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates
performance after the Company Merger Effective Time (a) none of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including
any rights

 



       
 

 



 

arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants, and
agreements, shall survive the Company Merger Effective Time, and (b)
thereafter there shall be no liability on the part of any of the Buyer Parties
or the Company, the Partnership or any of their respective officers,
directors, trustees or stockholders in respect thereof. Except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement, there are no representations or warranties of any
Party, express or implied. Each of the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Parent Confidentiality Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Parent Confidentiality Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the entire agreement
and supersedes all of the prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly
permitted by the terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Except (i) for
_Article II_ and _Article III_, which shall inure to the benefit of the
Company Stockholders and the limited partners of the Partnership who are
expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce
the covenants contained therein, (ii) for _Section 7.5_ which shall inure to
the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are expressly
intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the
covenants contained therein, and (iii) the right of the Company, on behalf of
its Stockholders and the limited partners of the Partnership, to pursue
damages in the event of Parents, Merger Subs or Merger Partnerships breach
of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer on any person other than the Parties or their respective
heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby,
and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable,
unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the
Parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the
Mergers that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom. If any provision
of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction._

 



 

(a) The Partnership Merger shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of
conflict of laws. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence,
all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Maryland without regard to
its rules of conflict of laws, except that provisions of the DLLCA applicable
to

 



      
 

 



 

the authorization, effectiveness and effects of the Company Merger will apply
to the Company Merger.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to and
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City
(Maryland), Business and Technology Case Management Program (the " **Maryland
Court** ") for any litigation arising out of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (and agree not to commence any litigation
relating thereto except in such court), waive any objection to the laying of
venue of any such litigation in the Maryland Court and agree not to plead or
claim in the Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has been
brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to request and/or consent to the assignment of any such
proceeding to the Maryland Courts Business and Technology Case Management
Program. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect the rights of any
Party to pursue appeals from any judgments or order of the Maryland Court as
provided by Law. Each of the Parties agrees, (a) to the extent such Party is
not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Maryland, to
appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland as such Partys agent
for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be
made on such Party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid
service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal
force and effect as if served upon such Party personally within the State of
Maryland.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation
by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the
Party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any Party
hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any
other provision hereunder.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the
