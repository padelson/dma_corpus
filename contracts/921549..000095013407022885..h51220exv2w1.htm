     1.  |   | We have been informed that Trico Marine Services, Inc.

NOK 22.50 per warrant less the exercise price of the warrant. The Board of
Directors of Active Subsea has agreed that it will recommend the Tender
Offer. The Tender Offer will be subject to the following principal conditions
(all of which may be waived by the Offeror):  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | Offeror receiving valid and unconditional
acceptances of the Tender Offer which, together with the number of shares

all outstanding options and warrants;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | Offeror and Target having received necessary approvals

    | (iv)  |   | amendments to provide that the outstanding warrants to
purchase shares of Active Subsea shall vest upon a change of control of
Active Subsea (which the Offer will constitute, upon closing), and that they
shall be assignable, shall have been adopted at an Extraordinary General
Meeting of Active Subsea, and the warrants shall have been so amended;  
   

   ##### 

  

  

Execution Version 

     

       | (v)  |   | Offeror confirming that there are no material
inaccuracies of representations or warranties made by Target in that certain

Transaction Agreement and no legal challenges or impediments to the
closing of the Offer and the acceptance by Offeror of the shares; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (vi)  |   | no material change in the capital structure of Target
and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole), including but not limited to any

transactions or commitments of material significance for the nature or scope
of its operations or the purchase or sale of the Targets shares by Target
and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole), having occurred after the date of
the document for the Offer.  
   

  

     2.  |   | I/we currently own the number of Active Subsea Shares

---|---|--- 
      
  3.  |   | In the event that the offer price in the Tender Offer exceeds

Warrants.  
      
  6.  |   | I/we confirm that my/our Active Subsea Shares and/or Active
Subsea Warrants, at completion of the Tender Offer, will be transferred to
the Offeror free from charges and encumbrances and together with all rights
attaching thereto.  
      
  7.  |   | I/we accept that this advance acceptance, including its terms
and conditions and my/our name is made public in the offer document and/or

matching the terms of the competing offer.

Subsea for NOK 22.50 per share  
---|---|---

Houston, US and Ålesund, Norway  November 5, 2007 

  

Trico Marine Services, Inc. (Nasdaq: TRMA) ("Trico") and Active Subsea ASA
(NOTC: ASUB) ("Active Subsea") today announced that Trico intends to make a
voluntary offer for all outstanding shares and warrants of Active Subsea. The
offer price per share of Active Subsea will be NOK 22.50 paid in cash. The
offer values Active Subseas equity at approximately NOK 1.31 billion
(approximately US$242 million at exchange rates as of November 2, 2007). The
board of directors of Active Subsea believes that it is in the best interests
of the companys shareholders to support the offer. All board members in
Active Subsea have pre-accepted the offer for the shares they hold in
Active Subsea, including options and warrants. The transaction is expected to
be completed in the fourth quarter of 2007 and is subject to regulatory and
other customary approvals, as well as to Trico receiving valid and
unconditional acceptances of the offer from shareholders representing more
than 90% of the outstanding shares of Active Subsea. 

  

Active Subsea ASA is a marine supply services company based in Ålesund, Norway
with eight medium-sized VS 470 multi-purpose service vessels ("MPSVs") on
order for delivery beginning in 1Q08 through 1Q09. Active Subseas vessels
are designed to support subsea services, including performing inspection,
maintenance and repair work using remotely operated vessels ("ROVs"),
dive and seismic support and light construction activities. Active Subsea has
already secured three long-term contracts with customers for operations in
Brazil and Mexico. 

  

Trico believes the acquisition will provide the following benefits: 

   

       |   | expands Tricos ability to offer subsea services with the
addition of a fleet of eight versatile vessels, doubling the number of
vessels in its fleet capable of such activities,  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | advances Tricos newbuild program, with 11 DP 2 vessels now
scheduled for delivery in 2008 and 2009  
      
    |   | leverages Tricos global footprint in growth markets and
broadens Tricos customer base to include subsea service and construction
companies,  
      
    |   | provides opportunities to secure long-term contracts, enhancing
earnings stability, and  
      
    |   | maintains Tricos financial strength.  
   

 

Joe S. Compofelice, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Trico, stated, "We
are extremely excited about this transaction as it is consistent with both
the strategic and capital deployment 

    ##### 

  

  

Execution Version 

    

objectives that Trico has outlined for investors over the past several months.
By adding Active Subseas versatile VS 470 MPSVs to our fleet, we are able to
offer our customers vessels suited for a broad array of subsea services. We
will become one of the largest operators of new MPSVs for the growing subsea
market. This transaction enhances our newbuild program by providing for near-
term deliveries which accelerates cash flow from the vessels and provides an
advantage in securing customer contracts. Additionally, this transaction will
allow us to further leverage our unique global presence by offering these
vessels, which are attractive to customers in each of our international
markets. With the acquisition of Active Subsea, we will establish a new
division, Trico Subsea, which will be focused on marketing and operating
these vessels as well as other vessels in our fleet that are capable of
serving the subsea market." 

  

Robert Welsvik, Chief Executive Officer of Active Subsea, stated, "We believe
this transaction recognizes the strategic value of our vessels and represents
a fair price for our shareholders. We are pleased to see Active Subsea become
the centerpiece of Trico Subsea, and believe that Tricos global presence and
operating expertise will lead to great success in the placement and
operations of the vessels." 

  

Johan Hagenaes, Director of Active Subsea, added, "As a board member and
significant shareholder, I believe Tricos offer reflects fair value and will
provide all of Active Subseas shareholders with an excellent return on their
investment. As a founder of Active Subsea and long-time participant in the
offshore industry, I am excited that these vessels will be placed into Tricos
global network and capable hands for the benefit of our customers. I believe
that Trico Subsea is an excellent successor to build upon the foundations
that Robert, I and others at Active Subsea have created." 

  

Following the transaction, management of Active Subsea will continue to
supervise the construction of the vessels and participate in marketing
efforts for a transition period.
