Recommendation may be withdrawn by the Active Subsea board of directors (the &#147;<U>Active Subsea

Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section&nbsp;2.1(c) below) is made to Active Subsea and is not
withdrawn; (ii)&nbsp;Active Subsea promptly provides Trico with written notice of the Alternative
Acquisition Proposal setting forth the identity of the offeror and the material terms of the offer
and further provides at least five (5)&nbsp;business days prior written notice of any meeting of Active
Subsea&#146;s board of directors to consider and determine whether such Alternative Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Proposal; (iii)&nbsp;Trico does not amend the terms of the Offer to match (or exceed) the
terms of the Alternative Acquisition Proposal; (iv)&nbsp;Active Subsea&#146;s board of directors determines
that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood

appropriate) to Active Subsea&#146;s board of directors or to all of Active Subsea&#146;s shareholders to
purchase all of the outstanding common stock of Active Subsea on terms that the board of directors
of Active Subsea determines, in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Alternative Acquisition Proposal, are more favorable to all of Active Subsea&#146;s shareholders,

Subsea&#146;s versatile VS 470 MPSVs to our fleet, we are able to offer our customers vessels suited for
a broad array of subsea services. We will become one of the largest operators of new MPSVs for the
growing subsea market. This transaction enhances our newbuild program by providing for near-term

global presence by offering these vessels, which are attractive to customers in each of our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There are a number of important factors involving risks and uncertainties beyond the control of
Trico that could cause actual events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. Specific factors which could cause such material differences include,
among other things, successful outcome of the offer process for the Active Subsea shares. A
description of risks and uncertainties relating to Trico Marine Services, Inc. and its industry and
other factors, which could affect Trico&#146;s results of operations or financial condition, are
included in the Trico&#146;s U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. All financials for Active
Subsea are based on international financial reporting standards, and a U.S. GAAP reconciliation is
not available at this time. The statements in this presentation that use such words as &#147;believe,&#148;
&#147;expect,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;contemplate,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; or &#147;plan,&#148; or similar expressions are
also forward-looking statements. The above listing of factors is representative and is not
intended as an all-encompassing list of such factors. We disclaim any obligation to update
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
