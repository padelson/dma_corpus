and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California and Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the CGCL and DLLCA, as applicable, and shall make all other

of Second Step Merger has been duly filed with each of the Secretary of State
of the State of California and Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Parent in
writing and specified in the Certificate of Second Step Merger (the effective

as the "Second Effective Time").

"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. This

result of the Initial Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub 1, the Company, any Securityholder or any other Person:

  



  

(a) Cancellation of Certain Shares. All Shares that are owned by Parent,
Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or
any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no

(b) Conversion of Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any Share to be cancelled and retired in
accordance with Section 2.10(a), and any Dissenting Share, which shall be
treated in the manner provided in Section 2.12) shall be cancelled and
converted automatically into the right to receive, (i)(A) an amount in cash
equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration and (B) a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Per Share Stock Consideration, _less_ the holder's
Shareholder Pro Rata Share of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares Fund

any issuances that are made from the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares
Fund, if and when payable according to the terms hereof and the Escrow
Agreement and (iii) the holder's Shareholder Pro Rata Share of any issuances
that are made in connection with the Post-Closing Adjustment Distribution

Section 2.11 Treatment of Company Options.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall adopt all such
resolutions and take all such actions necessary to cause the Company Stock
Incentive Plan to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) By virtue of the Mergers and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof or any other Person, the Cashed Out Portion of each Company
Option shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to the
product of (A) the number of Shares underlying the Cashed Out Portion of such
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_
(B) the amount by which the Per Option Consideration exceeds the Company
Option's exercise price per share (the "Closing Option Consideration"). The
Company shall cause payment of the Closing Option Consideration to be made to
the holder of such Company Option, if a current or former employee of the
Company or a Subsidiary, through the payroll system of the relevant employer
entity or, if not a current or former employee of the Company or a
Subsidiary, through the Exchange Agent or Escrow Agent (as applicable) as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(c) By virtue of the Mergers and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof or any other Person, the Assumed Portion of each Company
Option shall be assumed by Parent and automatically converted into an option
(each, an "Assumed Option") to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock. Each
Assumed Option will continue to be subject to substantially the same terms
and conditions (including vesting and forfeiture) as applied to the Assumed
Option immediately before the Effective Time, after giving effect to any
accelerated vesting in connection with the Closing, except that (i) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock underlying each Assumed Option will equal
the product of (x) the number of shares underlying the Assumed Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (y) the Assumption
Exchange Ratio (rounding the result down to the nearest whole share) ("Post-
Exchange Share Number"), (ii) the exercise price per share will equal the
quotient determined by dividing (x) (A) the product of the Post-Exchange
Share Number _multiplied by_ the Parent Stock Closing Price less (B) the Post-
Exchange Spread by (y) the Post-Exchange Share Number (rounding such quotient
up to the nearest whole cent), and (iii) all references to the Company in the
Company Stock Incentive Plan and the applicable stock option agreements will
be references to Parent.

  



  

(d) Any portion of a Company Option that constitutes neither an Assumed
Portion nor a Cashed Out Portion shall be cancelled immediately prior to the
Effective Time for no consideration.

  



  

(e) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be subject to any
applicable withholding Taxes.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions and
take all other actions, including obtaining any consents, as are necessary to
effect the treatment of the Company Options contemplated by this Section 2.11.

  



  

Section 2.12 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, including Section 2.09, any Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.10(a)) and held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such Shares in
accordance with Section 1300 of the CGCL (such Shares being referred to
collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails
to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights under the CGCL
with respect to such Shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive a
portion of the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only
such rights as are granted by Section 1300 of the CGCL; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal pursuant to Section 1300
of the CGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 1300 of the CGCL,
such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.10(b), without interest thereon. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company
shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the CGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent
shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

Section 2.13 Surrender and Payment.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and, subject to Section 2.11, each holder of a certificate formerly
representing any Shares (each, a "Share Certificate") shall cease to have any
rights as a shareholder of the Company.

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the receipt of the Requisite Company
Vote and in any event, prior to the Closing, the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each holder of Shares a letter of transmittal in the form to be negotiated in
good faith between Parent and the Company and agreed to prior to the Closing
(a "Letter of Transmittal") and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Share Certificates in exchange for the applicable portion of
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.10(b). The Exchange Agent shall,
no later than the later of (A) the third Business Day following the Closing
Date, or (B) five (5) Business Days after receipt of a Share Certificate or
Lost Stock Affidavit, as the case may be, together with (i) a Letter
of Transmittal and (ii) a Lock-Up Agreement effective as of the Effective
Time, each duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and any other customary documents that the Exchange
Agent may reasonably require in connection therewith, pay to the holder of
the Shares represented by such Share Certificate or Lost Stock Affidavit, as
the case may be, a cash amount as provided in Section 2.10(b) with respect to
such Share Certificate so surrendered or delivery of Lost Stock Affidavit, as
the case may be, and any such Share Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled.
Unless otherwise provided herein, no interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on any cash payable upon surrender of any Share Certificate. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Share Certificate that prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed from
and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to
receive the portion of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.10(b). If, after the Effective Time, any Share Certificate is presented to
the Exchange Agent, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Section 2.13.

  



  

(c) Each Shareholder shall also be entitled to any amounts that may be
payable in the future in respect of the Shares formerly represented by a
Share Certificate from the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares Funds, as
provided for in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, at the respective
times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein. Unless
otherwise provided herein, no interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of Shareholders on the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Share Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (A) such Share
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer, with an accompanying Letter of Transmittal to the same effect,
and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Share Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or
is not payable.

  



  

   

30

 



    



  

(e) Any portion of the Closing Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by
the Securityholders twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
automatically returned to Parent, and any such Securityholder who has not
exchanged Share Certificates or delivered a Lost Stock Affidavit for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.13 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that
may be payable upon surrender of any Share Certificates held by such holders,
as determined pursuant hereto, without any interest thereon; _provided_ ,
that any such portion of the Merger Consideration payable from the Post-
Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares Fund shall be held and distributed to the
Persons entitled thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and on account of the Post-Closing Adjustment, at the
respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and
therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any
holder of Share Certificates for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.

  



  

Section 2.14 Escrow Fund. In accordance with the Escrow Agreement, Parent
shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Escrow Agent the Post-Closing
Adjustment Escrow Shares, to be held for the purpose of securing the
obligations of the Shareholders pursuant to Section 2.19(e) (the "Post-
Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares Fund"), which such amount shall be deemed to
be contributed to the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares Fund by the
Shareholders in accordance with their Shareholder Pro Rata Share.

  



  

Section 2.15 No Further Ownership Rights in Shares or Company Options. All
Merger Consideration paid or payable upon the surrender of Share Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid or
payable in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Share Certificate, and, from and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Company. If, after the Effective Time,
Share Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for any
Shares other than Dissenting Shares, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article II and elsewhere in this Agreement.

  



      

Section 2.16 Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such change.

Section 2.17 Withholding Rights. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger
Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Article II such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted to the
applicable Taxing Authority by the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2 or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2 or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

  



  

Section 2.18 Lost Share Certificates. If any Share Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
("Lost Stock Affidavit") by the Person claiming such Share Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Share Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Share Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Share Certificate as
contemplated under this Article II.

  



  

Section 2.19 Closing Adjustments.

  



  

(a) Target Performance Adjustment.

  



  

(i) At least three (3) Business Days before Closing, the Company shall
prepare and deliver a statement certifying the total EBITDA that the Company
reasonably expects to achieve in fiscal year of 2019 (the "Estimated
Performance Target"), which certificate shall be subject to the reasonable
review and approval of Parent. The Estimated Performance Target shall
be calculated utilizing methods, practices, principles, policies and
procedures set forth on _Schedule 2.19(a)(i)_.

  



  

(ii) The "Target Performance Stock Consideration Adjustment" shall equal
$1,500,000.00 for every $100,000 by which the Estimated Performance Target is
below $23,800,000.00. The Target Performance Stock Consideration Adjustment
shall equal zero if the Estimated Performance Target is above $23,800,000.00.

  



  

(b) Closing Adjustment.

  



  

(i) At least three (3) Business Days before the Closing, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to Parent a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement")
setting forth its good faith estimates of each component of the Share
Consideration Adjustment Amount Value (the "Estimated Share Consideration
Adjustment Amount Value"), which statement shall contain an
estimated unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date
(without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein), and a
certificate of the Vice President of Finance of the Company that the Estimated
Closing Statement was prepared in accordance with US GAAP and using the
accounting methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures used to
prepare the Financial Statements (as modified by Schedule 2.19(b)) (the
"Accounting Policies"). In the event of any conflicts between US GAAP and the
Accounting Policies, US GAAP shall control. The parties hereto agree that the
purpose of preparing the Estimated Closing Statement and determining Current
Assets and Current Liabilities pursuant to this Section 2.19 is to adjust for
inaccuracies in the estimates in the amounts of Closing Working Capital,
Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Excess Cash, Company MandA Fund Cash
Amount, and Closing Indebtedness as of the Closing, and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the estimates of
Closing Working Capital, Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Excess Cash,
Company MandA Fund Cash Amount and Closing Indebtedness as of the Closing. The
Company shall cooperate with Parent in supplying any other information Parent
may reasonably request in order to verify the amounts reflected on the
Estimated Closing Statement. The estimates of Closing Working Capital, Excess
Cash, Company MandA Fund Cash Amount and Closing Indebtedness as of the Closing
set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement, with any changes thereto as
agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, will be used for
purposes of calculating the Closing Merger Consideration absent manifest
error.

  



  

   

32

 



    



  

(ii) The "Estimated Closing Adjustment" shall be that number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the Estimated Share Consideration Adjustment
Amount Value _divided by_ the Parent Stock Signing Price.

  



  

(c) Post-Closing Adjustment.

  



  

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, the Sponsor Designated
Directors shall prepare and deliver to the Company Representative a statement
(the "Closing Statement") setting forth their calculation of each component of
the Share Consideration Adjustment Amount Value as of the Closing (the "Final
Share Consideration Adjustment Amount Value"), which statement shall contain
an unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (without
giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein), a calculation of the
Working Capital Surplus (if any) or Working Capital Shortfall (if any), as
applicable, Closing Indebtedness, and the Excess Cash Surplus (if any) or
Excess Cash Shortfall (if any), as applicable, and a certificate of the chief
financial or accounting officer of Parent that the Closing Statement was
prepared in accordance with US GAAP and the Accounting Policies. The "Final
Closing Adjustment" shall be the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the Final Share Consideration Adjustment Amount Value _divided
by_ the Parent Stock Signing Price.

  



  

(ii) The "Post-Closing Adjustment" shall be equal to the Final Closing
Adjustment _minus_ the Estimated Closing Adjustment.

  



  

   

33

 



    



  

(d) Examination and Review.

  



  

(i)  _Examination_. After receipt of the Closing Statement, the Company
Representative shall have thirty (30) days (the "Closing Statement Review
Period") to review the Closing Statement. During the Closing Statement Review
Period, the Company Representative and its accountants shall have full access
to the books and records of the Surviving Company, the personnel of, and work
papers prepared by, Parent and/or its accountants to the extent that they
relate to the Closing Statement and to such historical financial information
(to the extent in Parent's possession) relating to the Closing Statement as
the Company Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of
reviewing the Closing Statement and to prepare a Statement of Objections
(defined below), _provided _ that such access shall be in a manner that does
not interfere with the normal business operations of Parent or the
Surviving Company.

  



  

(ii)  _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the Closing Statement
Review Period, the Company Representative may object to the Closing Statement
by delivering to Parent a written statement setting forth their objections in
reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for
its disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Objections"). If the Company
Representative fails to deliver the Statement of Objections before the
expiration of the Closing Statement Review Period, the Closing Statement and
the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in the Closing
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Company
Representative. If the Company Representative delivers the Statement of
Objections before the expiration of the Closing Statement Review Period,
Parent and the Company Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such objections within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
Statement of Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so
resolved within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the
Closing Statement with such changes as may have been previously agreed in
writing by Parent and the Company Representative, shall be final and binding.

  



  

(iii)  _Resolution of Disputes_. If the Company Representative and Sponsor
Designated Directors fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of the
matters set forth in the Statement of Objections before expiration of the
Resolution Period, then any amounts remaining in dispute ("Disputed Amounts"
and any amounts not so disputed, the "Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted
for resolution to the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants mutually agreed upon by the Sponsor
Designated Directors and the Company Representative (such accountant chosen
pursuant to this Section 2.19(d)(iii), the "Independent Accountant") who,
acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts
only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may
be, and the Closing Statement. The parties hereto agree that all adjustments
shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent Accountant shall
only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties and their decision
for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each
such item in the Closing Statement and the Statement of Objections,
respectively.

  



  

(iv)  _Fees of the Independent Accountant_. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by the Company Representative (on behalf
of the Securityholders), on the one hand, and by Parent, on the other hand,
based upon the percentage that the amount actually contested but not awarded
to the Company Representative or Parent, respectively, bears to the aggregate
amount actually contested by the Company Representative and Parent.

  



  

   

34

 



    



  

(v)  _Determination by Independent Accountant_. The Independent Accountant
shall make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or
such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their
adjustments to the Closing Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment shall
be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

  



  

(e) Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment.

  



  

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number, the Company
Representative and the Sponsor Designated Directors shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment,
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (A) disburse from the Post-Closing
Adjustment Escrow Shares Fund to the Surviving Company, the Post-Closing
Adjustment and (B) instruct the Exchange Agent to distribute any shares
remaining in the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares Fund to the
Shareholders in accordance with their Shareholder Pro Rata Shares; _provided_
, that, in no event shall the determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment
pursuant to this Section 2.19(e)(i) exceed the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares Fund and no
Shareholder shall be required to forfeit or return any of the Share
Consideration received by the Shareholder at the Closing.

  



  

(ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, the Sponsor
Designated Directors shall, within five (5) Business Days after the final
determination thereof, (A) cause Parent to issue that number of new shares of
common stock of Parent equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment _divided by_ the
Parent Stock Signing Price, and to deposit such shares with the Exchange
Agent for distribution to the Shareholders in accordance with their
Shareholder Pro Rata Shares, and (B) instruct the Escrow Agent to deposit any
remaining Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares with the Exchange Agent or the
Company, as the case may be, for distribution to the Shareholders in
accordance with their Shareholder Pro Rata Shares (collectively, the "Post-
Closing Adjustment Distribution"; _provided_ , that Parent shall not be
required under any circumstances to issue more than 857,143 shares of new
common stock of Parent (in excess of any remaining Post-Closing Adjustment
Escrow Shares) pursuant to this Section 2.19(e).

  



  

(iii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is zero (0), no additional action with
respect to the Post-Closing Adjustment shall be taken.

  



  

(iv) The amount of any Post-Closing Adjustment shall not bear any interest.

  



  

(f) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to this Section
2.19 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration by the
parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Tax Law.

Section 5.10 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

  



  

(a) The Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 agree that all rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company
now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or
director of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 (each a
"DandO Indemnified Party") as provided in their respective organizational
documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "DandO
Indemnification Obligations"), shall be assumed by the Parent and the
Surviving Company in the Mergers, without further action, at the Effective
Time and shall survive the Mergers and shall remain in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any proceeding is
pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final
disposition of such proceeding or claim. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company in the Mergers to,
fulfill and honor in all material respects the DandO Indemnification
Obligations, without diminishing any right to seek indemnity under Article
VIII.

  



  

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Company (the "DandO
Indemnifying Parties") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each DandO
Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or
omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), and shall reimburse each DandO Indemnified Party for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such DandO Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are
incurred, subject to the Parent's receipt of an undertaking by such DandO
Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in
advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction that such DandO Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither the Parent nor the Surviving Company will be liable for any
settlement effected without such party's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(c) At or prior to the Closing, the Surviving Company shall obtain and fully
pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6)
years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amount and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
directors and officers of Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, as the
existing policies with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events
which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the "Parent DandO Tail
Policy"). The Surviving Company shall bear the cost of the Parent DandO Tail
Policy. During the term of the Parent DandO Tail Policy, Parent shall not (and
shall cause the Surviving Company not to) take any action following the
Closing to cause the Parent DandO Tail Policy to be cancelled or any provision
therein to be amended or waived.

(d) At or prior to the Closing, the Surviving Company shall obtain and fully
pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6)
years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amount and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
directors and officers of the Company as the Company's existing policies with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before
or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) (the "Company DandO Tail Policy"). The Surviving
Company shall bear the cost of the Company DandO Tail Policy. During the term
of the Company DandO Tail Policy, Parent shall not (and shall cause the
Surviving Company not to) take any action following the Closing to cause the
Company DandO Tail Policy to be cancelled or any provision therein to be
amended or waived.

  



  

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section
5.10 shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.10 applies without the consent of
such affected DandO Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the DandO
Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.10 applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.10, each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this Section 5.10).

  



  

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. The agreements and covenants
contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to
which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section
5.10 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

  



  

Section 5.11 Closing Conditions. From the date hereof until the earlier of
the Closing or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX, each
party hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are

the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of the SEC or any securities

"parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder), such that, if the Requisite 280G Vote is
received approving such payments and benefits, such payments and
benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Prior to such Requisite
280G Vote, the Company shall obtain, from each person who is a "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder) and who might otherwise have, receive or have the
right or entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section 280G of the

this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional
information is set forth for informational purposes and does not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature. Disclosure of such additional
information will not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such
information is required to be disclosed, and disclosure of such information
will not be deemed to enlarge or enhance any of the representations or
warranties in this Agreement or otherwise alter in any way the terms of
this Agreement. Inclusion of information in the Disclosure Schedules will not
be construed as an admission that such information is material to the
business, assets, liabilities, financial position, operations or results of
operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

Section 5.19 Extensions. If either the Company or the Parent reasonably
believes that the Closing may not occur by April 9, 2020, but that the

thereafter, then the Parent shall seek the approval of the Parent's
stockholders to extend the deadline, including amending Parent's Governing
Documents and the Trust Agreement (as applicable), for the Parent to
consummate its initial Business Combination (the " _Extension_ ") to a date
no earlier than June 30, 2020 (or such earlier date as the Company and the
Parent may otherwise agree, and which may be structured as multiple monthly

and shall inform the other party of any material oral comments, that such
party or its Representatives receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement, the Parent Special Meeting, the Redemption and the
Company Special Meeting promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall
give the other party a reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to
review and comment on any proposed written or material oral responses to such
comments.

  



  

(g) Parent will cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC
and to be distributed to Parent's stockholders and, pursuant thereto, Parent

with this Section 6.03, except to the extent a different Tax Refund has
already been netted against such Taxes; provided, further, that if a Tax
Refund is netted against any Taxes described Section 8.02(e), such Taxes
shall be treated as having been paid by the Securityholders for purposes of
Article VIII; provided, further, that if and to the extent the value of Parent
Common Stock is directly or indirectly relevant to the determination of the
amount of any Tax Refund, solely for purposes of this Section 6.03, the amount
of such Tax Refund shall be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that
such Tax Refund does not exceed the amount that would have been received had
such Tax Refund been determined based on the Parent Stock Signing Price.
Parent shall pay to the Company Representative (for distribution to each
Securityholder on Pro Rata Share basis) as additional consideration the amount
of any such Tax Refund within fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof or
entitlement thereto. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Company to make all filings and take all actions necessary to secure
such Tax Refunds as promptly as possible.

  



  

Section 6.04 Tax Returns.

  



  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall prepare and timely file, or cause
to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by it
that are due on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any
extensions), and shall timely pay all Taxes that are due and payable on or
before the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions). Any such Tax
Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (unless
otherwise required by Law).

  



  

   

91

 



    



  

(b) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
and for any Straddle Period. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law). If
such Tax Return is an income or other material Tax Return that include Taxes
for which Company Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify pursuant to
Article VIII, such Tax Return shall be submitted by Parent to the Company
Representative (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent
requested by the Company Representative, supporting documentation) at least
forty-five (45) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax
Return. If the Company Representative objects to any item on any such Tax
Return that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, it shall, within fifteen
(15) days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Parent in writing that it
so objects, specifying with particularity any such item and stating the
specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of
objection shall be duly delivered, Parent and the Company Representative shall
negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such
items. If Parent and the Company Representative are unable to reach such
agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by Parent of such notice, the
disputed items shall be resolved by the Independent Accountant and any
determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final. The Independent
Accountant shall resolve any disputed items within twenty (20) days of having
the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the
Independent Accountant is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due
date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Parent
and then amended to reflect the Independent Accountant's resolution. The
costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally
by Parent and the Company Representative.

  



  

(c) The preparation and filing of any Tax Return of the Company or its
Subsidiaries that does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period shall be exclusively within the control of Parent.

  



  

(d) Unless required by applicable Law, Parent shall not, and shall not cause
or permit any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries
after the Closing) to (a) amend any Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (b) make any Tax election with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has retroactive effect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (c) voluntarily approach any Taxing Authority
regarding any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including by means of any State or multi-state
voluntary disclosure program), or (d) consent to any extension or waiver of
the limitation period applicable to any claim or assessment in respect of
Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case without prior written
consent of the Company Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), if such action could
reasonably give rise to an indemnification claim by Parent or Surviving
Company against the Company Indemnifying Parties under this Agreement.

  



  

   

92

 



    



  

Section 6.05 Straddle Period. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
parties hereto will treat or elect to treat the Closing Date as the last day
of the taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax purposes
and items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit will be apportioned
based upon a closing of the books for Tax purposes in accordance with Treasury
Regulation § 1.1502-76(b), _provided_ no elections will be made under either
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (relating to ratable
allocation of a year's items) or Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii) (to ratably allocate the items for the month which
includes the Closing Date). In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect
to a taxable period that begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date
(each such period, a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such Taxes that
are treated as being attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for purposes of
this Agreement shall be:

  



  

(a) in the case of Taxes (i) based upon, or related to, income, receipts,
profits, wages, capital or net worth, (ii) imposed in connection with the
sale, transfer or assignment of property, or (iii) required to be withheld,
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended
with the Closing Date; and

  



  

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period _multiplied by_ a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire period.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of this Section 6.05,
Section 6.04 and the determination of Tax liabilities taken into account in
Closing Working Capital, any deductions related to (A) the acceleration of
deferred financing fees related to the repayment of Indebtedness or and (B)
the payment of any fees or other expenses associated with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are paid or accrued on or
before the Closing Date and not required to be capitalized, to the extent
included as a deduction in the calculation of Merger Consideration (including
payment or accrual of Indebtedness, and other items included as a deduction
in the calculation of Merger Consideration) or paid pursuant to Section 2.11
shall be treated as attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 6.06 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Company
Representative, the Company and Parent shall provide each other with such
cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the
others in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this Article VI or in connection
with any Action in respect of Taxes of the Company. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or
portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers
and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by applicable tax
authorities. Each of the Company Representative, the Company and Parent shall
retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents
in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company for any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and
other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent
notified by any of the other parties in writing of such extensions for the
respective Tax periods. Prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Company for any taxable period
beginning on or before the Closing Date, the Company Representative, the
Company or Parent (as the case may be) shall provide the other parties with
reasonable written notice and offer the other parties the opportunity to take
custody of such materials.

  



  

Section 6.07 FIRPTA Statement. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver
to Parent a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, certifying to the
effect that no interest in the Company is a "United States real property
interest" within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code (such certificate
in the form required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h) and
1.1445-3(c)) (the "FIRPTA Statement").

  



  

   

93

 



    



  

Section 6.08 Tax Contests. Parent and Company Representative (on behalf of
the Securityholders) shall give each other reasonably prompt written notice,
but in any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days, after receipt of
any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to
Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which any of the Parent
Indemnitees may be entitled to indemnification from the Company Indemnifying
Parties under Article VIII (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or
similar event, a "Tax Matter"). The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
suffers a loss or limitation of rights or defenses by reason of such failure.
Parent shall control all Tax Matters, provided that to the extent such Tax
Matter could reasonably be expected to result in an indemnification obligation
of the Company Indemnifying Parties, Parent shall keep Company Representative
reasonably informed regarding the status of any Tax Matter and not agree to
settle or compromise any such Tax Matter without the prior written consent of
Company Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In the event of any conflict between the provision of
this Section 6.08 and Section 8.04, this Section 6.08 shall control with
respect to matters relating to Taxes.

Article VIII. 
 Indemnification

  



  

Section 8.01 Survival. From and after Closing, subject to the limitations and
other provisions of this Agreement, the representations and warranties,
covenants, agreements and indemnities contained herein shall survive the
Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the date that is
twelve (12) months from the Closing Date (such date, the "Indemnification
Date") and will thereafter expire and be of no further force and effect;
_provided further, that_ any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement, by its express terms that is required to be performed for any
duration after the Indemnification Date will survive the Indemnification Date
until the expiration of such duration and will thereafter expire and be of no
force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in good
faith with reasonable specificity, including with respect to the estimate of
Losses (to the extent known at such time) and in writing by notice from the
Indemnified Party to the Company Representative prior to the expiration date
of the applicable survival period and for Losses incurred prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period and set forth in such claim
notice shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the relevant
representation or warranty and such claims shall survive until finally
resolved. The parties hereto further acknowledge that the time periods set
forth in this Section 8.01 for the assertion of claims under this Agreement
are the result of arm's-length negotiation among the parties hereto and that
they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties
hereto.

  



  

Section 8.02 Indemnification by Company Indemnifying Parties. Subject to the
other terms and conditions of this Article VIII, the holders of Shares and
holders of Vested Company Options (collectively, the "Company Indemnifying
Parties"), severally and not jointly (in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares), shall indemnify and defend Parent, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Parent Indemnitees") against, and shall hold
each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of
them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Parent Indemnitees by reason of or arising out of:

  



  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of the Company contained in this Agreement, as of the date such
representation or warranty was made or as if such representation or warranty
was made on and as of the Closing Date (except for representations and
warranties that expressly relate to a specified date, the inaccuracy in or
breach of which will be determined with reference to such specified date);

  



  

(b) any breach or non-fulfilment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by the Company in this Agreement;

  



  

(c) any claim made by any Securityholder relating to such Person's rights
with respect to the Merger Consideration, or the calculations and
determinations set forth on the Allocation Certificate;

  



  

(d) any amounts paid to the holders of Dissenting Shares, including any
interest required to be paid thereon, that are in excess of what such holders
would have received hereunder had such holders not been holders of Dissenting
Shares; or

  



  

   

97

 



    



  

(e) (i) all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods; (ii) all Taxes for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or
its Subsidiaries (or any of their predecessors) is or was a member prior to
the Closing by reason of a liability under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any comparable provisions of foreign, state or local Tax Law;
(iii) any breach of the Company's obligations under Article VI, (iv) any and
all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries arising
under the principles of transferee or successor liability or by contract,
relating to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing Date, and (v)
Taxes for which Securityholders are responsible pursuant to Section 6.01(b),
but in each case excluding any (A) Taxes to the extent treated as a liability
in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, Indebtedness or otherwise taken
into account as a deduction in computing the Merger Consideration, (B) Taxes
resulting from the filing of any election after the Closing having retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, including under Section 338 of the Code
or similar election for foreign, state or local income Tax purposes, (C)
Taxes incurred on the Closing Date but after the Closing that are outside the
ordinary course of the Company's business, (D) Taxes of any person imposed on
the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to commercial agreements entered into
with third parties in the ordinary course of business, the principal purpose
of which is not related to Taxes, which Taxes relate to any Post-Closing Tax
Period (in the case of a Straddle Period, as determined pursuant to Section
6.05), (E) any employer Taxes incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with payments pursuant to Section 2.11, and (F) Taxes for which
Parent is responsible pursuant to Section 6.01(b); _provided_ that if and to
the extent the value of Parent Common Stock is directly or indirectly
relevant to the determination of any amount pursuant to this Section 8.02(e),
solely for purposes of this Section 8.02(e), such determination shall be made
based on the Parent Stock Signing Price.

  



  

Section 8.03 Certain Limitations. The indemnification provided for in Section
8.02 shall be subject to the following limitations:

  



  

(a) Except in the case of Fraud, all Losses in excess of the Cap for
indemnification claims under Section 8.02(a) and Section 8.02(e) shall be
satisfied exclusively under the RandW Insurance Policy, with no further recourse
against the Company Indemnifying Parties or any Affiliates thereof. Parent
hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except in the case of Fraud, the sole
source of recovery for indemnification claims under Section 8.02(a) and
Section 8.02(e) for Losses in excess of the Cap incurred or sustained by or
imposed upon the Parent Indemnitees shall be the RandW Insurance Policy.

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 8.03(a) above and Section 8.08, the aggregate
liability of the Company Indemnifying Parties under Section 8.02(a) and
Section 8.02(e) shall not exceed $2,600,000 (the "Cap"), except in the case
of Fraud by any Company Indemnifying Party. For clarity, the sole source of
recovery of the Parent Indemnitees for any Losses in excess of the Cap with
respect to indemnification claims under Section 8.02(a) and Section 8.02(e)
shall be the RandW Insurance Policy.

  



  

(c) If and to the extent any of the Company Indemnifying Parties are liable
directly for claims under Section 8.02, each Company Indemnifying Party shall
only be liable for its Pro Rata Share of any such claim, and with respect to
claims under Section 8.02(a) and Section 8.02(e), each Company Indemnifying
Party shall only be liable for its Pro Rata Share of any such claim up to the
Cap, except in the case of Fraud by any Company Indemnifying Party. For
clarity and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amounts
offset against Tax Refunds with respect to Taxes described in Section 8.02(e)
pursuant to Section 6.03 shall not be considered recovery for Losses with
respect to claims under Section 8.02(e) and thus, shall not be subject to the
Cap.

  



  

(d) For purposes of this Article VIII, the determination of whether there has
been any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations or warranties of the
Company in this agreement or the amount of a Loss entitled to indemnification
hereunder shall each be made without giving effect to any qualification in
the representations and warranties of the Company Indemnifying Party by
materiality, in all material respects, Material Adverse Effect or words of
similar effect.

  



  

   

98

 



    



  

(e) The amount of any Losses recoverable by Parent Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 8.02 will be reduced by the amounts actually recovered by Parent
Indemnitees under any applicable insurance policies, contractual rights and
the amount of indemnification and other payments recovered or recoverable by
Parent Indemnitees under any applicable indemnification agreements or similar
rights as a result of the facts that entitled the Parent Indemnitees to
recover pursuant to Section 8.02. Each Parent Indemnitee agrees to make all
claims and to collect any amounts recoverable under applicable insurance
policies (other than self-insurance policies), indemnification agreements,
contracts and similar rights and to seek recovery under all applicable
insurance policies, indemnification agreements, contracts and similar rights
for all Losses to the extent such Losses are covered by any insurance policy,
indemnification agreement, contract or similar right of such Parent
Indemnitee. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any
Parent Indemnitee with respect to any Losses for which any such Person has
been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of
the recovery will be made promptly to the Company Indemnifying Parties.

  



  

(f) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE PARENT INDEMNITEES
WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER OR ASSERT ANY CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION UNDER
THIS ARTICLE VIII WITH RESPECT TO, NOR WILL THE INDEMNIFIABLE LOSSES HEREUNDER
INCLUDE OR BE DEEMED TO INCLUDE EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE LOSSES, OTHER THAN ANY
SUCH LOSSES RESULTING FROM PAYMENTS TO THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
OTHERWISE INDEMNIFIABLE LOSS HEREUNDER.

  



  

(g) The Parent Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover any Losses
relating to any matter arising under, or any facts and circumstances relating
to or arising out of, a provision of this Agreement to the extent that the
Parent Indemnitees have already recovered Losses with respect to such matter
pursuant to another provision of this Agreement. If a state of facts exists
that would allow a Parent Indemnitee to seek recovery under both Section
8.02(a) and Section 8.02(b) then such Parent Indemnitee only may seek
recovery for Losses under Section 8.02(a). In calculating amounts payable to
any Parent Indemnitee hereunder, the amount of any Losses will be determined
without duplication of any other Losses for which an indemnification claim has
been made under any other representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding as otherwise provided herein, in no event shall any
Company Indemnifying Party be liable for Losses under Section 8.02 in excess
of the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration actually received by such
Company Indemnifying Party (net of any amounts withheld from such Company
Indemnifying Party pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements), other than as a
result of such Company Indemnifying Party's Fraud.

  



  

Section 8.04 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
Article VIII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this Article VIII is referred to as
the "Indemnifying Party". For purposes of this Section 8.04 only, any
references to Indemnified Party shall be deemed to refer to the Sponsor
Designated Directors and any references to Indemnifying Party (except
provisions relating to an obligation to make payments) shall be deemed to
refer to the Company Representative.

  



  

   

99

 



    



  

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party suffers a loss or limitation of rights or defenses by
reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe
the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and specifying the basis hereunder
upon which the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification is asserted,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the good faith, non-binding, preliminary estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party with reasonable particularity. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume and control the defense of any Third Party Claim
at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own
counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense; _provided that_ if the Indemnifying Party is a Company
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party (through the Company
Representative) shall only be permitted to assume such defense so long as (i)
such Third Party Claim involves only monetary damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief (and does not involve criminal or quasi
criminal allegations or a claim to which the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes an adverse determination would be materially detrimental to or
materially injure the Indemnified Party's reputation or future business
prospects), (ii) Indemnifying Party provides a written acknowledgement of the
Indemnifying's Party's indemnification obligations under this Agreement with
respect to such Third Party Claim in question and the Losses related to such
Third Party Claim, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.03
(provided, however, that if it's reasonably probable that the Losses relating
to such Third Party Claim (including all attorneys' fees and expenses relating
thereto) exceed the amount of the Cap, then this condition (ii) shall be
deemed to have not been met),and (iii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the
defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall have the right to control any
Third Party Claim that involves any Straddle Period, _provided_ that Parent
shall obtain the prior written consent of the Company Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before
entering into any settlement of, or ceasing to defend, such claim; and,
_provided further_ , that the Company Representative shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice
for such purpose, the fees and expenses of which separate counsel shall be
borne solely by the Company Representative. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section
8.04(b), it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to
avoid, settle, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any
such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to conduct and control the defense thereof. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party, _provided that_ if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required
shall be deemed to be Losses. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 8.04(b), pay,
compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any
and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim.
the Company Representative and Parent shall cooperate with each other in all
reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim,
including making available records relating to such Third Party Claim and
furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-
pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-
defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Third Party Claim.

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as provided in this Section 8.04(b). If a firm offer is made to settle
a Third Party Claim that will not result in liability or a future obligation
on the part of the Indemnified Party (the "Settlement Offer") and provides,
in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party
from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim
and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within
ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim
shall not exceed the amount of the Settlement Offer. If the Indemnified Party
fails to consent to such Settlement Offer and also fails to assume defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party
Claim upon the terms set forth in such Settlement Offer to settle such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to
Section 8.04(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless and to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is not liable for the costs, fees or other expenses of
such settlement.

  



  

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party suffers a loss or limitation of rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of
all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount,
if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party and specifying the basis hereunder upon which the
Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification is asserted. The Indemnifying
Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond
in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Company's
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so
respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim. In any event, if the parties do not
agree, the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

  



  

   

101

 



    



  

Section 8.05 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article VIII, but subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 8.03, the Indemnifying Party shall
satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) Business Days of such final, non-
appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds. It is
hereby agreed that Sponsor Designated Directors shall be responsible for
directing the collection of any such Losses from the Indemnifying Parties. 

  



  

Section 8.06 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

  



  

Section 8.07 Effect of Investigation . The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known
that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by
reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition set forth in Section
7.02.

  



  

Section 8.08 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 10.14, the parties
acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud, criminal activity,
wilful violation or wilful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement to
which the Company is a party with respect to the Company, shall be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VI and this Article VIII.

(i) neither Parent, Merger Sub 1 nor Merger Sub 2 is then in material breach
of any provision of this Agreement and there has been a breach, inaccuracy in
or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, by the time required for such

specified in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 and in the case such breach,
inaccuracy or failure has not been cured by the Company within thirty (30)
days of the Company's receipt of written notice of such breach from Parent; or

  



  

   

102

 



    



  

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 shall

agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior
to the Closing;

  



  

(c) by the Company by written notice to Parent if:

  



  

(i) the Company is not then in material breach of any provision of this

1 or Merger Sub 2 pursuant to this Agreement, by the time required for such
performance, that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.03 shall
not have been, or if it becomes apparent that any of such conditions will not

failure of the Company to perform or comply in any material respect with any
of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied
with by it prior to the Closing;

  



  

(d) by Parent or the Company if there shall be any Law that makes
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or
otherwise prohibited or any Governmental Entity shall have issued a
Governmental Order restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and such Governmental Order shall have become final and non-
appealable;

  



  

(e) by written notice by either Parent or the Company, if the Parent Special
Meeting is held (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) and has
concluded, Parent's stockholders have duly voted, and the Required Parent
Stockholder Approval was not obtained;

adopting this Agreement and approving the transactions contemplated hereby is
not delivered to Parent and the Company within two (2) Business Days following

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby was not obtained, or (iv)
by Parent if either the shareholder meeting of Teamsun or the shareholder
meeting of ASL has not been held by the date that is 30 days prior to the
Outside Date;

  



  

   

103

 



    



  

(h) by the Company or ASL by written notice to Parent upon reaching the
Outside Date if, after giving effect to (i) the payment by Parent to its
stockholders who have validly elected to have their shares of Parent Common
Stock redeemed for cash pursuant to the Parent Organizational Documents as
part of the Redemption and (ii) the receipt of any Additional Equity Amount,
the Available Parent Cash is less than the Minimum Available Parent Cash

Article X. 
 Miscellaneous

  



  

Section 10.01 Trust Account Waiver. The Company acknowledges that Parent is a
blank check company with the powers and privileges to effect a Business
Combination. The Company further acknowledges that, as described in the
prospectus of Parent dated October 5, 2018 (the "Prospectus") available at
www.sec.gov, substantially all of Parent assets consist of the cash
proceeds of Parent's initial public offering and substantially all of those
proceeds have been deposited in the Trust Account for the benefit of Parent,
certain of its public stockholders and the underwriters of Parent's initial
public offering. The Company acknowledges that it has been advised by Parent
that, except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust
Account that may be released to Parent to pay its franchise tax, income tax
and similar obligations, the Trust Agreement provides that cash in the Trust
Account may be disbursed only (i) if Parent completes the transactions which
constitute a Business Combination, then to those Persons and in such amounts
as described in the Prospectus; (ii) if Parent fails to complete a
Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject
to the terms of the Trust Agreement, to Parent in limited amounts to permit
Parent to pay the costs and expenses of its liquidation and dissolution, and
then to Parent's public stockholders; and (iii) if Parent holds a shareholder
vote to amend Parent's certificate of incorporation and bylaws to modify the
substance or timing of the obligation to redeem 100% of Parent Common Stock
if Parent fails to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time
period, then for the redemption of any Parent Common Stock properly tendered
in connection with such vote. For and in consideration of Parent entering
into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Company hereby irrevocably waives any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind they have or may have in the future in or to any
monies in the Trust Account or any distributions therefrom and agree not to
seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom as
a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with Parent; provided that (x) nothing herein shall serve to
limit or prohibit the Company's right to pursue a claim against Parent for
legal relief against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account,
for specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the
consummation of the transactions (including a claim for Parent to specifically
perform its obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of
the balance of the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after giving effect to
the Redemptions) to the Securityholders in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long as such claim would not affect
Parent's ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the Redemptions, or
for fraud and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims
that the Company may have in the future against Parent's assets or funds that
are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been
released from the Trust Account and any assets that have been purchased or
acquired with any such funds).

  



  

   

104

 



    



  

Section 10.02 Company Representative.

  



  

(a) By executing and delivering a Letter of Transmittal, each Securityholder
shall have irrevocably authorized and appointed Company Representative as
such Person's representative and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of such
Person and its successors and assigns with respect to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and to take any and all actions and make any decisions
required or permitted to be taken by Company Representative pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the power to:

  



  

(i) give and receive notices and communications;

  



  

(ii) authorize delivery to Parent of Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares
from the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares Fund in satisfaction of any
amounts owed to Parent pursuant to Section 2.18;

  



  

(iii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with orders or otherwise handle any other matters described in Section
2.18;

  



  

(iv) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with orders of courts with respect to claims for indemnification made
by Parent pursuant to Article VI (Tax Matters) and Article VIII
(Indemnification);

  



  

(v) litigate, arbitrate, resolve, settle or compromise any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Article VIII (Indemnification);

  



  

(vi) execute and deliver all documents necessary or desirable to carry out
the intent of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

  



  

   

105

 



    



  

(vii) make all elections or decisions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement;

  



  

(viii) engage, employ or appoint any agents or representatives (including
attorneys, accountants and consultants) to assist Company Representative in
complying with its duties and obligations; and

  



  

(ix) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of
Company Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

  



  

Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with Company Representative on
all matters relating to this Agreement (including Article VIII) and the
Escrow Agreement and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further
evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be
executed on behalf of any Securityholder by Company Representative, and on any
other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Securityholder
by Company Representative, as being fully binding upon such Person.
Notices or communications to or from Company Representative shall constitute
notice to or from each of the Securityholders. Any decision or action by
Company Representative hereunder, including any agreement between Company
Representative and Parent relating to the defense, payment or settlement of
any claims for indemnification hereunder, shall constitute a decision or
action of all Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each such Person. No Securityholder shall have the right to object to,
dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same. The provisions of this
Section, including the power of attorney granted hereby, are independent and
severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall not be
terminated by any act of any one or Securityholders, or by operation of Law,
whether by death or other event. Notice to the Company Representative,
delivered in the manner provided in Section 10.05, will be deemed to be
notice to all Securityholders and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

(b) The Company Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed for
any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of a majority in
interest of the Securityholders according to each Securityholder's Pro Rata
Share (the "Majority Holders"); _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall
Company Representative resign or be removed without the Majority Holders
having first appointed a new Company Representative who shall assume such
duties immediately upon the resignation or removal of Company Representative.
In the event of the death, incapacity, resignation or removal of Company
Representative, a new Company Representative shall be appointed by the vote
or written consent of the Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy of
the written consent appointing such new Company Representative shall be sent
to Parent, such appointment to be effective upon the later of the date
indicated in such consent or the date such notice is received by Parent;
_provided_ , that until such notice is received, Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger
Sub 2 and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to rely on the
decisions and actions of the prior Company Representative as described in
Section 10.02(a) above.

  



  

(c) The Company Representative shall not be liable to the Securityholders for
actions taken pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except to
the extent such actions shall have been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have constituted gross negligence or involved fraud,
intentional misconduct or bad faith (it being understood that any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel, accountants and other
professionals and experts retained by Company Representative shall be
conclusive evidence of good faith). The Securityholders shall severally and
not jointly (in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares), indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Company Representative from and against, compensate it for,
reimburse it for and pay any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions,
damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements,
arising out of and in connection with its activities as Company
Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (the
"Company Representative Losses"), in each case as such Company Representative
Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event it is finally
adjudicated that a Company Representative Loss or any portion thereof was
primarily caused by the gross negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct or
bad faith of Company Representative, Company Representative shall
reimburse the Securityholders the amount of such indemnified Company
Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence, fraud,
intentional misconduct or bad faith. The Company Representative Losses shall
be satisfied by the Securityholders, severally and not jointly (in accordance
with their Pro Rata Shares).

  



  

   

106

 



    



  

Section 10.03 Sponsor Designated Directors

  



  

(a) The Sponsor Designated Directors shall serve as representatives of Parent
from and after the Effective Time and to act on behalf of Parent to take all
necessary actions and make all decisions and direct all actions of Parent
related to its rights and obligations hereunder, including in connection with
Article VIII. In the event of a Sponsor Designated Director's death,
resignation, removal or refusal to serve, then, if prior to the Effective
Time, the board of directors of Parent or, if following the Effective Time,
the Sponsor, shall designate another individual as a replacement for such
Sponsor Designated Director.

  



  

(b) Each of the Sponsor Designated Directors shall have such powers and
authority as are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sponsor
Designated Directors shall have full power, authority and discretion, as
applicable to the extent provided in this Agreement, on behalf of Parent, to
(i) after the Closing, negotiate and enter into amendments to this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, (ii) dispute, negotiate, settle and take other
actions as may be required in connection with final calculation and
determination of Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, and Excess
Cash as contemplated in Section 2.19, and (iii) dispute, negotiate, settle and
take other actions as may be required in connection with Article VIII,
including in respect of any fraud claims, and to administer the release and
cancellation of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. None of the Sponsor
Designated Directors shall have any liability to Parent, the Company, the
Company Representative or any holder of Parent Securities, with respect to
actions taken or omitted to be taken in his or her capacity as a Sponsor
Designated Director as designated hereunder (except for those arising out of
such Sponsor Designated Director's gross negligence, willful misconduct or
fraud), but without effect on such Sponsor Designated Director's duties to
Parent and its shareholders in his or her capacity as a member of the board
of directors of Parent in matters unrelated to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 10.04 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have
occurred. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from and
after the Closing, the Surviving Company shall pay the amount of any expenses
incurred by Parent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 10.10 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub
2, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may assign its rights
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party
or parties, as the case may be, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. No assignment shall relieve any assigning party of any
of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

Section 10.01 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section
5.10, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.12 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. On or prior to the
Effective Time, this Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented
by an agreement in writing signed by Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and
the Company, and after the Effective Time, this Agreement may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by the
Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the Company Representative; _provided_
, _however_ , that after the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, there shall
be no amendment or waiver that, pursuant to applicable Law, requires further
approval of the Securityholders, without the receipt of such further
approvals (it being understood that the Parties may seek to, in the manner
provided by this Section 10.12, amend this Agreement to modestly decrease the
Cash Consideration and modestly increase the Share Consideration to be issued
at the Effective Time, provided that the Cash Consideration will be sufficient
for ASL to extinguish its indebtedness and pay its cash taxes). Any failure
of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein may be waived by the Company (with respect to any failure by
Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2) or by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub
2 (with respect to any failure by the Company), respectively, only by a
written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver
or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

  



  

Section 10.13 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction).

  



  

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY SHALL BE INSTITUTED IN IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN SANTA
CLARA COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS
TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURT IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO
SUCH PARTY'S ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS
FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF
ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND
AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM.

Section 10.14 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

Section 10.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission
shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original
signed copy of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.6 Legal Representation.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
hereto intend that all communications at or prior to the Closing between the
Company, on the one hand, and any of its attorneys, on the other hand,
including all communications relating to the negotiation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Protected
Communication"), and all associated rights to assert, waive and otherwise
administer the attorney-client privilege and right of confidentiality the
Company (the "Associated Rights"), will, from and after the Closing, rest
exclusively with the Company Representative and will not be transferred,
assigned, conveyed or delivered, by operation of law or otherwise, to Parent,
Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or any of their respective Affiliates or any
successor or assign of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Parent
Group"). Accordingly, the parties hereby agree that, as of immediately prior
to the Closing, for the consideration set forth herein and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged: (i) all Protected Communication and Associated Rights
are, and will be deemed for all purposes, transferred, assigned, conveyed and
delivered in full to the Company Representative, and (ii) neither Parent,
Merger Sub 1 nor Merger Sub 2 will have any right, title, interest or benefit
in or to any of the Protected Communication or any Associated Rights. Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge the decision of the
Delaware Chancery Court in Great Hill Equity Partners IV, LP, et al. v. SIG
Growth Equity Fund, I, LLP, et al. (Civil Action No. 7905-CS, November 15,
2013) and desire to expressly exclude the Protected Communication and
Associated Rights from the assets, rights, privileges and benefits of the
Company that might otherwise be transferred or assigned to any member of the
Parent Group by operation of law or otherwise.

  



  

(b) Parent hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the other
members of the Parent Group, from and after the Closing, that the Company
Representative (i) will have the right to take possession and control of all
Protected Communication effectively as of the Closing and (ii) if and to the
extent the Company Representative fails to take such possession and control
(which failure will not, alone or in association with any other act or
omission, be deemed a waiver of any of their rights under this Section
10.16), the Company Representative will have the right to access and copy,
from time to time, any Protected Communication in the possession or control
of Parent from and after the Closing, during normal business hours and on not
less than twenty-four hours prior written notice, as the Company
Representative determines, in its sole discretion, may be necessary or
desirable in connection with any post-closing matter, whether or not such
matter is known to any member of the Parent Group. If and to the extent that,
at any time from and after the Closing, any member of the Parent Group will
have any right or opportunity to assert or waive an attorney-client privilege
or right of confidentiality with respect to any Protected Communication, each
member of the Parent Group will not, and will cause Parent not to, waive such
privilege or right of confidentiality without the prior written consent of the
Company Representative (which consent may be withheld, conditioned or delayed
in its sole discretion).
