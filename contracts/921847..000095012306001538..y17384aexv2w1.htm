THE MERGER 

   

 _Section 2.01 Structure of the Merger._ 

   

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser will cause a Delaware corporation to be organized as a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of Purchaser or the Bank ("Merger Sub"). At the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge (the "Merger") with and into Seller, with Seller being the surviving entity (the "Surviving Corporation"), pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effect provided in, the DGCL and pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement and plan of merger ("Plan of Interim Merger") to be entered into between Merger Sub and Seller in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. The separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Surviving Corporation shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and its separate corporate existence with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Seller shall be amended in their entirety to conform to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall become the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub shall become the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation. As part of the Merger, each share of Seller Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of Section 2.03. 

  

 _Section 2.02 Bank Merger_. 

   

 Immediately after the Merger, the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation shall adopt a plan of dissolution (which shall be a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution of the Surviving Corporation for purposes of Section 332(a) and 337(a) of the Code) and shall cause articles of dissolution authorized in accordance with the DGCL to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Upon the certificate of dissolution becoming effective, the Bank and Seller Bank shall enter into a plan of merger (the "Plan of Bank Merger") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (which shall be a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution of Seller for purposes of Sections 332(a) and 337(a) of the Code) pursuant to which Seller Bank will be merged with and into the Bank (the "Bank Merger") pursuant to and with the effect set forth in the regulations of the OTS and the FDIC. The documentation relating to the Bank Merger shall provide that the directors and officers of Bank as the surviving entity of the Bank Merger shall be all of the respective directors and officers of Bank immediately prior to such merger. 

  

 _Section 2.03 Effect on Outstanding Shares_. 

   

 (a) By virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of Seller Common Stock, issued and outstanding at the Effective Time (other than (i) Dissenting Shares (the holder of which shall only have the rights provided under applicable law), (ii) shares held directly or indirectly by Purchaser (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted), (iii) unissued Seller Common Stock reserved for issuance 

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant to the Seller Stock Benefit Plans and (iv) Treasury Stock (the
shares referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Excluded Shares")) shall become and be
converted into the right to receive $20.75 in cash without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"). 

  

 As of the Effective Time, each Excluded Share, other than Dissenters Shares, shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no exchange or payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Seller Common Stock other than Excluded Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate formerly representing any such share of Seller Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Seller. 

  

 _Section 2.04 Exchange Procedures._ 

   

 (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Certificate previously representing shares of Seller Common Stock (except as specifically set forth in Section 2.03) shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to the terms of an agreement (the "Paying Agent Agreement") in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and Seller, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Seller Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.04, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 2.03(a). 

  

 (c) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but no later than ten (10) business days after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates the following: (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, only upon the delivery and surrender of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, which shall be in a form and contain any other provisions as Purchaser may reasonably determine; and (ii) instructions in effecting the delivery and surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, each stockholder of Seller that upon proper delivery and surrender of a Certificate or Certificates to the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Seller Common Stock represented by the Certificate or Certificates delivered and surrendered pursuant to the provisions hereof, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled forthwith. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration. If a transfer of ownership of any shares of Seller Common Stock has been made but not registered in the transfer records of Seller prior to the Effective Time, a check for the Merger Consideration may be issued to the transferee if the Certificate representing such Seller Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by documents sufficient, in the reasonable discretion of Purchaser and the Paying Agent, (i) to evidence and effect such transfer and (ii) to evidence that all applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

  

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of Seller of any shares of Seller Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.04. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration or the proceeds of any investments thereof that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Seller for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be repaid by the Paying Agent to Purchaser. Any stockholders of Seller who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.04 shall thereafter look only to Purchaser for payment of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Seller Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Seller Common Stock are not delivered and surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such payments would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of Purchaser (and to the extent not in its possession shall be paid over to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled to such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Seller Common Stock for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (f) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (g) Purchaser or the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Seller Common Stock, such amounts as Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by Purchaser or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Seller Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Purchaser or the Paying Agent. 

  

 _Section 2.05 Dissenters_ _ __Rights_. 

   

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Seller Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised his or her appraisal rights under the DGCL shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his or her right to dissent from the Merger or seek appraisal for his or her shares under the DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenters Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. If any such Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent or seek appraisal, the Dissenters Shares held by the holder shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenters Shares had been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.03. Seller shall give Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Seller Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of any such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by Seller relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 2.06 Stock Options_. 

   

 At the Effective Time, each Seller Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled and all rights thereunder shall be extinguished. As consideration for such cancellation, Seller shall make payment to such holder of an amount determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such holders Seller Option by (y) an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the Merger Consideration, over (ii) the exercise price per share of such Seller Option; provided, however, that no such payment shall be made to such holder unless, and such payment shall be deferred without interest until, such holder has agreed to such payment and has executed and delivered to Seller an instrument in such form prescribed by Purchaser and reasonably satisfactory to Seller accepting such payment in full settlement of his or her rights relative to the Seller Option. Prior to the date hereof (in the case of Messrs. McStravick and Fabiano and each non-employee director of Seller) and within thirty (30) days thereafter (in the case of all others), Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the written consent to the provisions of this Section 2.06 on the form prescribed by the Purchaser of each person who is the holder of Seller Options that will not, by their terms, expire prior to the Effective Time. Prior to date hereof, Seller shall have taken or shall have caused to have been taken, all requisite action under the terms of Stock Benefit Plans or otherwise to cause cancellation of all Seller Options in the manner set forth herein. 

  

 _Section 2.07 Closing; Effective Time_ _._  

   

 Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing contained in Article VIII hereof, the Closing shall occur (i) no later than five business days following the latest to occur of (a) the receipt of all required Regulatory Approvals and the expiration of any applicable waiting periods, or (b) the approval of the Merger by the stockholders of Seller, or (ii) at such other date or time upon which Purchaser and Seller mutually agree (the "Closing"). The Merger shall be effected by the filing of a certificate of merger with the Delaware Office of the Secretary of State on the day of the Closing (the "Closing Date"), in accordance with the DGCL. The "Effective Time" means the date and time upon which the certificate of merger is filed with the Delaware Office of the Secretary of State, or as otherwise stated in the certificate of merger, in accordance with the DGCL.

Seller has no reason to believe that (i) any required Regulatory Approvals or other required consents or approvals will not be received, or that (ii) any public body or authority, the consent or approval of which is not required or to which a filing is not required, will object to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 3.06 Fairness Opinion; Required Vote._ 

   

 Seller has received an opinion from Keefe, Bruyette and Woods to the effect that, subject to the terms, conditions and qualifications set forth therein, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by the stockholders of Seller pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement and Seller has no reason to believe that such opinion may be amended or rescinded after the date hereof. The affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock is the only vote of Stockholders required to approve this Agreement and the Merger under Sellers certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the DGCL. 

  

 _Section 3.07 Financial Statements._ 

   

 (a) As of their respective dates, neither Sellers Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 nor any other document filed subsequent to March 31, 2005 under Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, each in the form (including exhibits and any documents specifically incorporated by reference therein) filed with the SEC (collectively, the "Seller Reports"), contained or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the financial statements of Seller included in the Seller Reports complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations 

   ##### 

  

    

of the SEC with respect thereto and have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited financial
statements, as permitted by SEC Form 10-Q). Each of the balance sheets
contained or incorporated by reference in Sellers Reports (including in each
case any related notes and schedules) fairly presented the financial position
of the entity or entities to which it relates as of its date and each of the
statements of income and of changes in stockholders equity and of
cash flows, contained or incorporated by reference in the Seller Reports
(including in each case any related notes and schedules), fairly presented
the results of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows, as the case
may be, of the entity or entities to which it relates for the periods
set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments that are not material in amount or effect),
in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein. No event has occurred that would
cause a normal year-end adjustment to the unaudited interim
financial statements prepared prior to the date hereof (including such
statements as are included in the Sellers Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for
the periods ended June 30, 2005, September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2005)
that would be material in amount or effect and no such adjustment
is reasonably likely to occur. Seller has made available to Purchaser a true
and complete copy of all Seller Reports filed with the SEC since March 31,
2005. 

  

 (b) Seller and each Seller Subsidiary have each timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since December 31, 2002 with (i) the OTS, (ii) the FDIC, (iii) any state banking commission, (iv) and other state or federal regulatory authority having jurisdiction over insured depository institutions or their holding companies, (v) the SEC, (vi) the NASDAQ and (vii) any other self regulatory organization, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except to the extent the failure of a report, registration or statement to have been filed in a "timely" fashion has not and will not result in a failure to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations or materially prejudice the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary with respect to the applicable Governmental Entity. 

  

 _Section 3.08 Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ 

   

 Except as disclosed in the Seller Reports filed since March 31, 2005 and prior to the date of this Agreement and except for the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and disbursements of Seller incurred in connection with the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including reasonable attorneys fees of Seller and the fees of Sellers financial advisor, good faith estimates of which have been provided to Purchaser, since March 31, 2005 (i) neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has incurred any liability, except in the ordinary course of its business consistent with past practice, (ii) Seller and each Seller Subsidiary has conducted its respective businesses only in the ordinary and usual course of such businesses and (iii) there has not been any condition, event, change or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 _Section 3.09 Taxes._ 

   

 (a) (i) Seller, each Seller Subsidiary and the Seller Group has filed or caused to be filed, and with respect to Tax Returns due between the date of this Agreement and the date the Effective Time occurs, will timely file (including any applicable extensions) all Tax Returns required to be filed, (ii) all such Tax Returns are, or in the case of such Tax Returns not yet filed, will be, true, complete and correct in all material respects and such Tax Returns correctly reflected (or in the case of such Tax Returns not yet filed, will correctly reflect) the facts regarding the income, business, assets, operations, activities, status and other matters of Seller, each Seller Subsidiary and the Seller Group and any other information required to be shown thereon, and (iii) all Taxes of Seller, the Seller Subsidiaries and the Seller Group 

   ##### 

  

    

(whether or not reflected on any such Tax Returns) attributable to a Pre-
Effective Time Tax Period have been, or in the case of Taxes the due date for
payment of which is between the date of this Agreement and the date
the Effective Time occurs, timely paid in full, including, without
limitation, all Taxes which Seller, each Seller Subsidiary and the Seller
Group is obligated to withhold for amounts paid or owing to employees,
independent contractors, stockholders creditors and other third parties other
than Taxes that have been reserved or accrued on the balance sheet contained

 _Section 3.11 Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage._ 

   

 (a) Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, Seller and each Seller Subsidiary has good and, as to real property, marketable title to all assets and properties owned by Seller or each Seller Subsidiary in the conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in the balance sheet contained in the most recent Seller Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets and properties have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the date of such balance sheet and except to the extent that the failure to have good title to any personal property would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect), subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure liabilities for public or statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit 

   ##### 

  

    

facilities, reverse repurchase agreements or any transaction by a Seller
Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, (ii) statutory liens for amounts
not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith. Seller and
the Seller Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing
leases of real and personal properties used by Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such
properties as presently occupied and used by each of them and (iii)
encumbrances that do not materially affect the marketability of any title to
real property. Such existing leases and commitments to lease constitute or
will constitute operating leases for both tax and financial accounting
purposes and the lease expense and minimum rental commitments with respect
to such leases and lease commitments are as disclosed in all respects in the
notes to the Seller Financial Statements. Each real estate lease that will
require the consent of the lessor or its agent to consummate the effects
intended by the Merger or otherwise as a result of the Merger or the Bank
Merger by virtue of the terms of any such lease is listed in the Disclosure
Letter identifying the section of the lease that contains such prohibition or
restriction. 

  

 (b) With respect to all agreements pursuant to which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if any, Seller or such Seller Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security interest (which to Sellers Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien) in the securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby. 

  

 (c) Seller and each Seller Subsidiary currently maintain insurance for reasonable amounts with financially sound and reputable insurance companies, against such risks as companies engaged in a similar business would, in accordance with good business practice, customarily be insured. Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has received notice from any insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. There are presently no material claims pending under such policies of insurance and no notices have been given by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary under such policies. All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect, and within the last three years Seller and each Seller Subsidiary has received each type of insurance coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied indemnification for any claims submitted under any of its insurance policies. The Seller Disclosure Letter identifies all policies of insurance maintained by Seller and each Seller Subsidiary as well as the other matters required to be disclosed under this Section. 

  

 _Section 3.12 Intellectual Property._ 

   

 (a) The Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of all (i) Registered and/or material Intellectual Property owned by Seller and Seller Subsidiaries indicating for each Registered item the registration or application number and the applicable filing jurisdiction (collectively, the "Listed Intellectual Property"). Seller or the relevant Seller Subsidiary exclusively owns (beneficially, and of record where applicable) all Listed Intellectual Property, free and clear of all encumbrances, exclusive licenses and non-exclusive licenses not granted in the ordinary course of business. The Listed Intellectual Property is valid, subsisting and enforceable, and is not subject to any outstanding order, judgment, decree or agreement adversely affecting the Sellers use thereof or its rights thereto. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have sufficient rights to use all Intellectual Property used in its business as currently conducted. To Sellers Knowledge, Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries do not and have not in the past five years infringed or otherwise violated the Intellectual Property rights of any third party. There is no material litigation, opposition, cancellation, proceeding, objection or claim pending, asserted or threatened against the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary concerning the ownership, validity, registerability, enforceability, infringement or use of, or licensed right to use, any Intellectual Property. To the Sellers Knowledge, (x) no valid basis for any such litigation, opposition, cancellation, proceeding, objection or claim exists, (y) no Person is violating any Listed Intellectual Property or other Intellectual Property right 

   ##### 

  

    

owned or held exclusively by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary, and (z) the
Licensed Intellectual Property is valid, subsisting and enforceable and is
not subject to any outstanding order, judgment, decree or agreement
adversely affecting the Sellers use thereof or its rights thereto.
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
terminate or alter the terms pursuant to which the Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary is permitted to use any Licensed Intellectual Property and will not
create any rights by third parties to use any Intellectual Property owned by
the Purchaser (other than any termination, alteration or creation of any
rights that results from action of the Purchaser and its Affiliates). 

  

 (b) The Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of all Trade Secrets that are owned, used or held by Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, and to the Sellers Knowledge, such Trade Secrets have not been used, disclosed to or discovered by any Person except pursuant to valid and appropriate non-disclosure and/or license agreements which have not been breached. Seller has exercised commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Sellers and the Seller Subsidiaries current and prior employees who have access to confidential information have executed valid intellectual property and confidentiality agreements or are obligated, pursuant to Seller policies, to maintain the confidentiality of such information for the benefit of Seller or the relevant Seller Subsidiary on terms and conditions consistent with industry standards. All Intellectual Property developed under contract to Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries has been assigned to Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) To Sellers Knowledge, the IT Assets operate and perform in all respects in accordance with their documentation and functional specifications and otherwise as required by Seller in connection with its business, and have not malfunctioned or failed within the past three years. To Sellers Knowledge, the IT Assets do not contain any "time bombs," "Trojan horses," "back doors," "trap doors," "worms," viruses, bugs, faults or other devices or effects that (1) enable or assist any person to access without authorization the IT Assets, or (ii) otherwise significantly adversely affect the functionality of the IT Assets, in either case except as disclosed in its documentation. To Sellers Knowledge, no person has gained unauthorized access to the IT Assets. Seller has implemented commercially reasonable backup and disaster recovery technology consistent with industry practices. 

  

 (d) To Sellers Knowledge, none of the software owned by it contains any shareware, open source code, or other software whose use requires disclosure or licensing of Intellectual Property. 

  

 _Section 3.13 Labor Matters._ 

   

 Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is or has ever been a party to, or is or has ever been bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract, or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization with respect to its employees and no such agreement or contract is currently being negotiated by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary, nor is Seller or any Seller Subsidiary the subject of any proceeding asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice or otherwise relating to labor matters involving any current or former employees of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or seeking to compel it or any Seller Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages and conditions of employment, nor is any strike, other labor dispute or organizational effort involving Seller or any Seller Subsidiary pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened.

 (c) From the period beginning January 1, 2003, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has received any written notification or any other communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization; (iii) requiring or threatening to require Seller or any Seller Subsidiary, or indicating that Seller or any Seller Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other agreement with any federal or state governmental agency or authority which is charged with the supervision or regulation of banks or engages in the insurance of bank deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit, in any material respect the operations of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the operations of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary (any such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or order described in this sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory Agreement").

or any Seller Subsidiary in which any employee or former employee, consultant
or former consultant or director or former director of Seller or any
Seller Subsidiary participates or to which any such employee, consultant or
director is a party or is otherwise entitled to receive benefits (the
"Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Other than as set forth in the Disclosure
Letter, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has any commitment
to create any additional Compensation and Benefit Plan or to modify, change
or renew any existing Compensation and Benefit Plan (any modification or
change that increases the cost of such plans would be deemed material),
except as required by law or regulation to maintain the qualified
status thereof. Seller has made available to Purchaser true and correct
copies of the Compensation and Benefit Plans and amendments thereto. 

  

 (b) Each Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, HIPAA and any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or other impositions for late filings have been paid in full. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is, and since its inception has been, so qualified, and has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and Seller is not aware of any circumstances which are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller threatened, action, suit or claim relating to any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to an unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. 

  

 (c) The Disclosure Letter sets forth the funding status of each Seller Defined Benefit Plan (as hereinafter defined) at December 31, 2004. No liability, other than PBGC premiums arising in the ordinary course of business, has been or could reasonably be expected by Seller, any Seller Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate (as hereinafter defined) to be incurred with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a defined benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA ("Seller Defined Benefit Plan"), or with respect to any "single-employer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or formerly maintained by Seller or any entity which is considered one employer with Seller under Sections 4001(a)(14) and (b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") (such plan hereinafter referred to as an "ERISA Affiliate Plan"). No proceeding has been initiated by the PBGC to terminate any Seller Defined Benefit Plan or to appoint a trustee to administer any Seller Defined Benefit Plan. No Seller Defined Benefit Plan had an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof and each Seller Defined Benefit Plan has been maintained in compliance with the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code. The fair market value of the assets of each Seller Defined Benefit Plan exceeds the present value of the "benefit liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such Seller Defined Benefit Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year with respect to the respective Seller Defined Benefit Plan ending prior to the date hereof, calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such Seller Defined Benefit Plan as of the date hereof; and no notice of a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) has been required to be filed for any Seller Defined Benefit Plan within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Seller Defined Benefit Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA. To the Knowledge of Seller, there is no pending investigation, audit or 

   ##### 

  

    

enforcement action by any Bank Regulator, the IRS, the U.S. Department of
Labor or the PBGC with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan or any
ERISA Affiliate Plan. 

  

 (d) The Seller and the ERISA Affiliates have never had an obligation to contribute to a "multi-employer plan" as such term is defined in section 3(37) of ERISA or had any direct or indirect liability or potential liability with respect to such a plan. 

  

 (e) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Compensation and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee benefit arrangements to which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party or a sponsor have been timely made, and all anticipated contributions and funding obligations are accrued on Sellers consolidated financial statements to the extent required by GAAP. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have expensed and accrued as a liability the present value of future benefits under each applicable Compensation and Benefit Plan for financial reporting purposes as required by GAAP. 

  

 (f) Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has any obligations to provide retiree health, life insurance, disability insurance, or death benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code and there has been no communication to employees by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such benefits. 

  

 (g) With respect to each Compensation and Benefit Plan, if applicable, Seller has provided or made available to Purchaser copies of the: (A) trust instruments and insurance contracts; (B) two most recent Forms 5500 filed with the IRS; (C) two most recent actuarial reports and financial statements; (D) most recent summary plan description; (E) most recent determination letter issued by the IRS; and (F) any Form 5310 or Form 5330 filed with the IRS within the last two years. 

  

 (h) Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the Merger will not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result of any termination of employment or service at any time prior to or following the Effective Time): (A) entitle any current or former employee, consultant, independent contractor or director to any payment or benefit (including severance pay, change in control benefit, or similar compensation) or any increase in compensation, (B) result in the vesting or acceleration of any benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan, (C) result in any material increase in benefits payable under or the obligation to fund benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan or (D) result in the triggering or imposition of any restrictions or limitations on the rights of Seller, any of the Seller Subsidiaries, the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any Compensation and Benefit Plan. Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the Merger and/or the Bank Merger will not, directly or indirectly (including without limitation, as a result of any termination of employment or service at any time prior to or following the Effective Time), entitle any current or former employee, director, consultant or independent contractor of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to any actual or deemed payment (or benefit) which could constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code). The Disclosure Letter includes a schedule of all termination benefits and related payments that would be employees who are participants in the Seller Bank Amended and Restated Severance Plan for Key Employees, under the Compensation and Benefit Plans, assuming their employment or service is terminated as of the Closing Date and based on the other assumptions specified in such schedule. Except for such individuals described in the previous sentence and those individuals who have delivered Settlement Agreements pursuant to Section 6.08(e), no other individuals are entitled to any termination benefits or any related payments under any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than a tax qualified Pension Plan). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (i) Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary maintains any compensation plans, programs or arrangements under which (i) payment is reasonably likely to become non-deductible, in whole or in part, for tax reporting purposes as a result of the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder, or (ii) any payment is reasonably likely to become subject to an excise tax under section 409A or 4999 of the Code. 

  

 (j) Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, there are no stock option, stock appreciation or similar rights, earned dividends or dividend equivalents, or shares of restricted stock, outstanding under any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans or otherwise as of the date hereof and none will be granted, awarded, or credited after the date hereof. 

  

 (k) Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, each BOLI contract of the Seller Bank (i) constitutes a "life insurance contract" as defined in Section 7702 of the Code, (ii) does not constitute a "modified endowment contract" as defined in Section 7702A of the Code and (iii) has not resulted in the loss or denial of an interest deduction under Section 264(f) of the Code. 

  

 (l) Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, each Compensation and Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued without liability to the Seller, any Seller Subsidiary, Purchaser, any Purchaser Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate.

 (iii) Seller has received no written notice that there is any suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending and, to Sellers

 Seller shall permit Purchaser reasonable access upon reasonable notice to its properties and those of the Seller Subsidiaries, and shall disclose and make available to Purchaser during normal business hours all of its books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of account (including the general ledger), tax records, minute books of directors (other than minutes that discuss any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter Seller reasonably determines should be treated as confidential) and stockholders meetings, organizational documents, Bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any other business activities or prospects in which Purchaser may have a reasonable interest; _provided, however,_ that Seller shall not be required to take any action that would provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure, in Sellers reasonable judgment, would interfere with the normal conduct of Sellers business or would violate or prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or other person, or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications between it and any of its counsel, or would be contrary to any law or regulation applicable to Seller Bank. Seller shall provide and shall request its auditors to provide Purchaser with such historical financial information regarding it (and related audit reports, consents and work papers) as Purchaser may reasonably request. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with Sellers regular business operations during any such access to Sellers property, books and records. Seller and each Seller Subsidiary shall permit Purchaser, at Purchasers expense, to cause a "phase I environmental audit" and a "phase II environmental audit" to be performed at any physical location owned or occupied by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary. 

  

 _Section 6.03 Financial and Other Statements._ 

   

 (a) Promptly upon receipt thereof, Seller will furnish to Purchaser copies of each annual, interim or special audit of the books of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries made by its independent accountants and copies of all internal control reports submitted to Seller by such accountants in connection with each annual, interim or special audit of the books of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries made by such accountants. 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than two business days after such documents are filed with the SEC, Seller will deliver to Purchaser the Seller Reports filed by it with the SEC. Within 10 business days after the end of each month Seller will deliver to Purchaser a consolidated balance sheet and a consolidated statement of operations, without related notes, for such month prepared in accordance with current financial reporting practices. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Seller will advise Purchaser promptly of the receipt of any examination report of any Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries. 

  

 (d) With reasonable promptness Seller will furnish to Purchaser such additional financial data that Seller possesses and as Purchaser may reasonably request, including without limitation, detailed monthly financial statements and loan reports. 

  

 _Section 6.04 Disclosure Letter Supplements._ 

   

 From time to time prior to the Effective Time, Seller will promptly supplement or amend the Disclosure Letter delivered in connection herewith with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Letter or which is necessary to correct any information in such Disclosure Letter which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such Disclosure Letter shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII or shall relieve Seller of any liability hereunder. 

  

 _Section 6.05 Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._ 

   

 In addition to the Obligations of Article VI hereunder, Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause each Seller Subsidiary, to obtain as soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any other persons necessary or desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 _Section 6.06 Failure to Fulfill Conditions._ 

   

 In the event that Seller determines that a condition to its obligation to complete the Merger or Bank Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that condition, it will promptly notify Purchaser. 

  

 _Section 6.07 No Solicitation._ 

   

 (a) Seller shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any Seller Subsidiary or any of their respective directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative (collectively, "Representatives") retained by it or any Seller Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which could reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall, and shall cause each Seller Subsidiary and any Representative engaged thereby, to immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Seller in good faith reasonably determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) (i) it is legally necessary for the proper discharge of its fiduciary duties to respond to such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.07(a), Seller may, subject to compliance with Section 6.07(c), (x) furnish information with respect to Seller and each Seller Subsidiary to the person making 

   ##### 

  

    

such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive to such person than the
confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that
all such information has previously been provided to Purchaser or is provided
to Purchaser prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of Seller nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Purchaser), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Seller), the adoption or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Seller Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or recommend, or allow the Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar contract constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.07(a)) (an "Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Seller may in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Seller in good faith reasonably determines (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was unsolicited and made after the date hereof and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.07, (1) make a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change or (2) cause Seller to terminate this Agreement and concurrently with or after such termination enter into an Acquisition Agreement as provided by and with the effect set forth in Article X; provided, however, that Seller shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause until after the fifth business day following Purchasers receipt of written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") from Seller advising Purchaser that the Board of Directors of Seller intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors. In determining whether to make a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change or to cause Seller to so terminate this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Seller shall take into account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Purchaser in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise. 

  

 (c) In addition to the obligations of Seller forth in Sections 6.07(a) and 6.07(b), Seller shall promptly advise Purchaser orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall (i) keep Purchaser fully informed in all material respects of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide to Purchaser as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Seller or any Seller Subsidiary from any person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (including any draft acquisition agreement) and (iii) keep Purchaser fully informed in all material respects of the status and details of any determination by Sellers Board of Directors with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.07 shall prohibit Seller from complying with its disclosure obligations under federal securities laws or state law; provided, however, that in no event shall the Seller or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 6.07(b) (it being understood that any accurate disclosure of factual information to 

   ##### 

  

    

the stockholders of Seller that is required to be made to such stockholders
under applicable federal securities Laws shall not be considered a
modification prohibited by clause (i)(A) of Section 6.07(b)). 

  

 _Section 6.08 Employee Benefits_ 

   

 (a) Purchaser intends to approach suitably qualified employees of Seller whose positions do not continue after the Effective Time to fill vacancies within the Purchaser wherever possible. Purchaser will review all Compensation and Benefit Plans to determine whether to maintain, terminate or continue such plans. In the event employee compensation and/or benefits as currently provided by Seller or Seller Bank are changed or terminated by Purchaser, in whole or in part, Purchaser shall provide Continuing Employees (as defined below in Section 6.08(c)) with compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated Purchaser employees (as of the date any such compensation or benefit is provided). All Continuing Employees who become participants in a compensation or benefit plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary shall, for purposes of determining eligibility for and for any applicable vesting periods of such employee benefits only (and not for benefit accrual purposes) be given credit for meeting eligibility and vesting requirements in such plans for service as an employee of Seller or Seller Bank or any predecessor thereto prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized for any purpose under Purchasers tax qualified defined benefit plan or retiree insurance plan. 

  

 (b) The Seller ESOP shall be terminated as of, or prior to, the Effective Time. All shares held by the Seller ESOP shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, all outstanding Seller ESOP indebtedness shall be repaid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, and the balance of the shares and any other assets remaining in the loan suspense account shall be allocated and distributed to Seller ESOP participants (subject to the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS), as provided for in the Seller ESOP and unless otherwise required by applicable law. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser, shall use their respective best efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable determination letter (including, but not limited to, making such changes to the ESOP and the proposed allocations as may be requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). Prior to the Effective Time, Seller, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser, will adopt such amendments to the Seller ESOP as may be reasonably required by the IRS as a condition to granting such favorable determination letter on termination. Neither Seller, prior to the Effective Time, nor Purchaser, following the Effective Time, shall make any distribution from the Seller ESOP except as may be required by applicable law until receipt of such favorable determination letter. In the case of a conflict between the terms of this Section and the terms of the Seller ESOP, the terms of the Seller ESOP shall control; however, in the event of any such conflict, Seller before the Effective Time, and Purchaser, after the Effective Time, shall use their best efforts to cause the Seller ESOP to be amended to conform to the requirements of this Section. 

  

 (c) In the event of any termination of any Seller or Seller Bank health plan or consolidation of any such plan with any Purchaser or Bank health plan, Purchaser shall make available to employees of Seller or Seller Bank who continue employment with Purchaser or a Purchaser Subsidiary ("Continuing Employees") and their dependents, employer-provided health coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to Purchaser employees. Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a Seller or Seller Bank health plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in the Purchaser or Bank health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of the Seller or Seller Bank health plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of Purchaser or Bank and their dependents. In the event of a termination or consolidation of any Seller or Seller Bank health plan, terminated Seller or 

   ##### 

  

    

Seller Bank employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to
continued coverage under group health plans of Purchaser or Bank in accordance
with Code Section 4980B(f), consistent with the provisions below. In the
event of any termination of any Seller or Seller Bank health plan, or
consolidation of any Seller or Seller Bank health plan with any Purchaser or
Bank health plan, individuals covered by the Seller or Seller Bank health
plan shall be entitled to immediate coverage under the Purchaser or Bank
health plan in accordance with HIPAA and the regulations issued thereunder,
including limitations on pre-existing condition exclusions, nondiscrimination
and special enrollment rights. All Seller or Seller Bank employees who cease
participating in a Seller or Seller Bank health plan and become participants
in a comparable Purchaser or Bank health plan shall receive credit for any
co-payment and deductibles paid under Sellers or Seller Banks health plan,
to the extent such credit would be provided under Sellers or Seller Banks
health plan, for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under the Purchaser or Bank health plan, upon
substantiation, in a form satisfactory to Purchaser or Bank that such co-
payment and/or deductible has been satisfied. 

  

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall take or cause to be taken all requisite action to (i) freeze, as of the Effective Time, future benefit accruals under Sellers defined benefit plans (whether or not tax-qualified) and (ii) if requested by Purchaser, to amend any or all of Sellers Compensation and Benefit Plans to prohibit the enrollment of new participants after the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) Purchaser shall assume and honor Seller and Seller Banks obligations under the Compensation and Benefit Plans; provided, however, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Richard P. McStravick, Anthony J. Fabiano and each of the members of the Board of Directors of Seller will execute and deliver to the Purchaser an agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (a "Settlement Agreement") setting forth the manner in which his or her rights under the Compensation and Benefit Plans will be settled by the Seller or the Purchaser or assumed and honored by the Purchaser, as applicable. 

  

 (f) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Seller and/or the Seller Subsidiaries shall terminate each of the Seller Bank Amended and Restated Director Deferred Fee Plan, the Seller Bank 2005 Director Deferred Fee Plan and the Seller Bank Amended and Restated Director Retirement Plan, and shall pay the amounts due thereunder in a lump sum to the participants therein, on or prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Code Section 409A. Each person receiving a payment thereunder shall concurrently execute and deliver an acknowledgment acknowledging the payment of the amounts due and releasing Purchaser, Seller and Seller Bank from any further obligations thereunder. 

  

 (g) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, a lump sum payment of the present value due to each executive in connection with a change in control under the Seller Bank Amended and Restated Non-Qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement shall be made to each executive who is a party to the Seller Bank Amended and Restated Non-Qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement. Each executive receiving a payment thereunder shall concurrently execute and deliver an acknowledgment acknowledging the payment of the amounts due and releasing Purchaser, Seller and Seller Bank from any further obligations thereunder. Following the distribution of all amounts due thereunder, but in any event, prior to the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Non-Qualified Supplement Executive Agreements shall be terminated. The Supplemental Retirement Agreement for William J. LaCalamito shall not terminate at the Effective Time but benefits due thereunder shall be paid in accordance with the agreement. 

  

 (h) After the execution of this Agreement, neither Seller nor Seller Bank shall reassign any person who is a "key employee" (within the meaning of the Amended and Restated Severance Plan for Key Employees) to a principal place of employment that is 30 or more miles from Purchasers executive offices at West 80 Century Road, Paramus, New Jersey. Purchaser will offer a service-based severance 

   ##### 

  

    

pay plan and an outplacement assistance program for employees of Seller
or Seller Bank who are discharged without cause within one year after the
Effective Time and who are not otherwise eligible for termination benefits
under an employment agreement or the Amended and Restated Severance Plan for
Key Employees. Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Seller or Seller Bank shall cause the Committee (as such term is defined in
the Seller Bank Amended and Restated Severance Plan for Key Employees) to
appoint the individuals designated by Purchaser or Bank as the successors to
the members of such Committee. 

  

 (i) Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller and Seller Bank shall amend the Sound Federal Savings Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement, the Sound Federal Savings Amended and Restated Director Retirement Plan and the Sound Federal Savings Amended and Restated Director Deferred Fee Plan to eliminate therefrom any restriction (other than any restriction specifically required to be set forth therein to avoid the imposition of an excise tax under section 409A of the Code) on the right of Purchaser to terminate or cause to terminate any of them, to the extent not terminated prior to the Effective Time. A certified copy of resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of Seller or Seller Bank, as applicable, effecting such amendments shall be included in Section 6.08(i) of the Disclosure Letter. 

  

 _Section 6.09 Advisory Board._ 

   

 Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish an Advisory Board (the "Advisory Board"). Each person who serves on the Board of Directors of Seller or Seller Bank both on the date of this Agreement and immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be appointed to the Advisory Board effective immediately following the Effective Time. The Advisory Board shall meet quarterly, and shall be continued for a period of three years. Each advisory board member shall receive an annual retainer of $20,000 payable at the first quarterly meeting of each year. 

  

 _Section 6.10 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._ 

   

 (a) Purchaser shall maintain, or shall cause the Bank to maintain, in effect for six years following the Effective Time, the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by Seller and Seller Bank (provided, that Purchaser may, at its option, substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser be required to expend annually pursuant to this Section 6.10(a) more than 175% of the annual cost currently expended by Seller and Seller Bank with respect to such insurance (the "Maximum Amount"); provided, further, that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Amount, Purchaser shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In connection with the foregoing, Seller agrees in order for Purchaser to fulfill its agreement to provide directors and officers liability insurance policies for six years to provide such insurer or substitute insurer with such representations as such insurer may request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims. 

  

 (b) In addition to Section 6.10(a), for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, an officer or director of Seller or an Seller Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or 

   ##### 

  

    

investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative (each a "Claim"),
in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or
witness in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact
that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Seller or a
Seller Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising,
existing or occurring before the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), to the fullest extent
permitted under Delaware law (to the extent not prohibited by federal
law), Purchasers Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and under Sellers
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Purchaser shall pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law (to the
extent not prohibited by federal law) upon receipt of an undertaking to repay
such advance payments if the Indemnified Party shall be adjudicated or
determined to be not entitled to indemnification in the manner set forth
below. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 6.10(b) upon learning of any Claim, shall notify Purchaser (but the
failure so to notify Purchaser shall not relieve it from any liability which
it may have under this Section 6.10(b), except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices Purchaser) and shall deliver to Purchaser the
undertaking referred to in the previous sentence. In the event of any such
Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) (1) Purchaser shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof (in which event the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter) and upon such
assumption Purchaser shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Purchaser elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are or may be
(whether or not any have yet actually arisen) issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Purchaser and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them, and Purchaser
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties, (2) except to the extent otherwise required due to
conflicts of interest, Purchaser shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph
to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties whose
reasonable fees and expenses shall be paid promptly as statements are
received unless there is a conflict of interest that necessitates more than
one law firm, (3) Purchaser shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (4) no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to a matter as to which
(x) he shall have been adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in
good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed
to, the best interests of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary, or (y) in the
event that a proceeding is compromised or settled so as to impose any
liability or obligation upon an Indemnified Party, if there is a
determination that with respect to said matter said Indemnified Party did not
act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interests of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary. Such
determination shall be made in accordance with the DGCL. 

  

 (c) In the event that either Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10. 

  

 (d) The obligations of Purchaser provided under this Section 6.10 are intended to be enforceable against Purchaser directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of Purchaser. Purchaser shall pay all reasonable costs, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 6.10 to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 6.11 Certain Policies of Seller._ 

   

 At the written request of Purchaser, each of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary shall modify and change its loan, litigation, real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves), investment and asset/liability management policies and practices and operating and internal control procedures after the date on which all required regulatory and shareholder approvals are received and immediately prior to the Effective Time so as to be consistent on a mutually satisfactory basis with those of Purchaser or the Bank; provided, that such policies and procedures are consistent with GAAP and all applicable laws and regulations. Sellers representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect for any purpose as a consequence of any modifications or changes undertaken solely on account of this Section 6.11. 

  

 _Section 6.12 Antitakeover Provisions._ 

   

 Seller shall take all steps (i) to exempt or continue to exempt Purchaser and Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger and the Bank Merger from any provisions of an anti-takeover nature in the Seller Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or equivalent documents), and the provisions of any federal or state anti-takeover laws, and (ii) upon the request of Purchaser, to assist in any challenge by Purchaser or Merger Sub to the applicability to this Agreement, the Merger and the Bank Merger of any federal or state anti-takeover law.

In connection with the solicitation of proxies with respect to the Seller Stockholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of Seller shall recommend approval of this Agreement to the Seller stockholders (subject to Section 6.07) and cooperate and consult with Purchaser with respect to each of the foregoing matters.

Seller represents and covenants that the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto, with respect to the information pertaining to it or its Subsidiaries at the date of mailing to its stockholders and 

   ##### 

  

    

the date of the Stockholder Meetings to be held in connection with the

and regulations of the SEC and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except as to
information regarding Purchaser as to which no representation or covenant is
being made). Purchaser represents and covenants that information regarding
Purchaser, that Purchaser provides to Seller for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading at the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement to
stockholders of Purchaser.

Each party acknowledges that time is of the essence in connection with the preparation and filing of the documentation referred to above. Seller shall have the right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to Seller and any of the Seller Subsidiaries which appear in any filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any governmental body. In addition, Seller and Purchaser shall each furnish to the other a copy of each publicly available portion of such filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any governmental body promptly after its filing.

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 8.02 Conditions to the Obligations of Purchaser under this

February ___, 2006 

   

Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. 
 West 80 Century Road 
 Paramus, New Jersey 07652  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

   

 Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. (the "Purchaser") and Sound Federal Bancorp, Inc. (the "Seller") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February 8, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (a) Seller will merge with and into a corporation to be formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hudson City Savings Bank (the "Merger") and (b) stockholders of Seller will receive the Merger Consideration stated in the Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 Purchaser has requested, as a condition to its execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, that the undersigned, being a director or officer of Seller and/or Seller Bank, execute and deliver to Purchaser this Letter Agreement (the "Agreement"). 

  

 The undersigned (the "Stockholder"), in order to induce Purchaser to execute and deliver the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, hereby irrevocably: 

  

 (a) Agrees to be present (in person or by proxy) at all meetings of stockholders of Seller called to vote for approval of the Merger so that all shares of common stock of Seller over which the undersigned or a member of the undersigneds immediate family now has sole or shared voting power (including any shares acquired by the Stockholder prior to the record date for such meetings) will be counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum at such meetings and to vote, or cause to be voted, all such shares (i) in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including any amendments or modifications of the terms thereof approved by the Board of Directors of Seller), and (ii) against approval or adoption of any other merger, business combination, recapitalization, partial liquidation or similar transaction involving Seller, it being understood that as to immediate family members, the undersigned will use his/her reasonable efforts to cause the shares to be present and voted in accordance with (i) and (ii) above; 

  

 (b) Agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a stockholder of Seller, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement; 

  

 (c) Agrees not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Seller Common Stock on or prior to the date of any meeting of Seller Stockholders to vote on the Merger Agreement, except for (i) transfers to charities, charitable trusts, or other charitable organizations under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, lineal descendants or the spouse of the undersigned, or to a trust or other entity for the benefit of one or more of the foregoing persons, provided that the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this letter agreement, and (ii) dispositions pursuant to cashless exercises of outstanding options to purchase common stock of Seller; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Represents that Stockholder (i) has full power, corporate or otherwise, to enter into this Agreement and that it is a valid and binding obligation enforceable against the undersigned in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws affecting creditors rights and general equitable principles, (ii) is the beneficial owner of all shares of Seller Common Stock as indicated on the final page of this Agreement (the "Shares"), which at the date hereof are, and at all times up until the Termination Date will be, free and clear of any liens, claims, options, charges, proxies or voting restrictions or other encumbrances, and (iii) does not beneficially own any shares of capital stock of Seller other than the Shares; 

  

 (e) Agrees that Stockholder will not, and will cause his or her representatives and agents not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information or assistance) the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any Person in furtherance of or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal or agree to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal, or authorize any of its representatives or agents to take any such action; provided, however, that nothing in this clause (e) shall prohibit Stockholder from taking actions in such Stockholders capacity as director or executive officer of the Seller in accordance with Section 6.07 of the Merger Agreement; 

  

 (f) Agrees to execute and deliver any additional documents necessary, in the reasonable opinion of Purchaser, to carry out the intent of this Agreement; 

  

 (g) Agrees not to assert, demand or exercise any rights of appraisal or dissenters in connection with the Merger; 

  

 (h) Agrees that if any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to the Purchaser. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, Stockholder and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of this Agreement as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible; 

  

 (i) Agrees that this Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Stockholder and Purchaser and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of Stockholder and Purchaser may be assigned by either Stockholder or Purchaser without the prior written consent of the other; 

  

 (j) Agrees that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Purchaser shall be entitled to specific relief hereunder, including, without limitation, an injunction or injunctions to prevent and enjoin breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in any state or federal court in the State of New York, in addition to any other remedy to which Purchaser may be entitled at law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with respect to any such remedy are hereby waived; 

  

 (k) Agrees that this Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regarding to conflicts of laws principles thereof other than Section 

   ##### 

  

 

5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law. Stockholder agrees that all
actions and proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or any
agreement, document or instrument executed in connection herewith shall be
tried and litigated in the state and Federal courts located in New York, New
York (other than appeals from those courts that may have to be heard outside

unexercised Stock Options addressed in any other manner.

 6. _Effect on other Agreement_ s. To the extent necessary to give effect to the purposes hereof, this letter shall constitute an amendment to each and every governing document for each and every plan, agreement or arrangement under which I may have a right to payments and benefits to reflect the relevant terms and conditions of this letter.

Sound Federal Savings will preserve through the Closing Date, and subject to paragraph 8 below, HCBK will honor following the Closing Date, the terms of the split dollar insurance arrangement in effect for me pursuant to which a permanent life insurance benefit in the amount of $___under [insurance company name] policy number [___] will be provided on and after the Closing Date (the "Split Dollar Benefit"). 

  

 5. _Unvested Restricted Stock_. As of the date of this letter, I have been granted [___] shares of restricted stock ("Restricted Stock") under the SFFS 2004 Incentive Stock Benefit Plan that have not yet vested. The Restricted Stock will continue to vest in accordance with its terms (including any acceleration provisions occasioned by the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) and will be exchanged for the Merger Consideration on the terms and in the manner provided in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 6. _Unexercised Stock Options_. As of the date of this letter, I have been granted the following options to purchase SFFS Common Stock that are unexercised (the "Stock Options"):

I understand and agree that the Stock Options that remain unexercised as of
the Effective Time will be canceled at or immediately prior to the Effective
Time and converted into the right to receive a cash amount for each share
subject to a Stock Option equal to the excess (if any) of (a) the
Merger Consideration over (b) its exercise price specified in the above
table, such amount to be paid at the time, in the manner and subject to the
terms and conditions specified in the Merger Agreement. I irrevocably consent
to the settlement of my Stock Options in this manner and waive any right
that I might otherwise have to have my unexercised Stock Options addressed in
any other manner. 

   

 7. _No Other Payments or Benefits_. I hereby acknowledge and agree with Sound Federal Savings, SFFS, and HCBK that, except for vested accrued benefits to which I am or become entitled under the Sound Federal Savings Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the Retirement Plan of Sound Federal Savings, and/or the Sound Federal Savings 401(k) Savings Plan (collectively, the "Qualified Plans"), the continuation coverage or conversion rights available at my own expense under any group life, medical, dental or disability plans or flexible spending accounts (the "Welfare Plans"), and any rights to indemnification or to errors and omissions insurance coverage, rights as a stockholder of HCBK and/or SFFS, and/or rights under contracts between me and HCBK that are, in each case, expressly provided for in the Merger Agreement (the "Additional Rights") (such payments and benefits under the Qualified Plans, Welfare Plans and Additional Rights, collectively, the "Basic Benefits") and the payments, benefits and other rights set forth in this letter, no other payments, benefits or other rights are due to me. 

  

 8. _Delivery of Receipts_. I understand and agree that SFFS and HCBK may condition the Settlement Payment, the SERP Payment and the Director Plan Payment on my execution and delivery of a receipt in such form as HCBK may reasonably prescribe acknowledging receipt of the payment in full settlement of my rights under the Company Agreement and Bank Agreement, the SERP or the Director Plan, as applicable, other than as specifically set forth herein. 

  

 9. _Rabbi Trust_. If for any reasons the Settlement Payment, the SERP Payment and/or the Director Plan Payment or any portion thereof are not made at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, any portion of such payments that is unpaid shall, at the Effective Time, be deposited in a rabbi trust with RSGroup Trust Company (or a comparable institutional trustee selected by HCBK) until paid. Upon the making of all such payments, the rabbi trust will terminate automatically and without action requirement of consent or other action on my part, 

  

 9. _Effect on other Agreements_. To the extent necessary to give effect to the purposes hereof, this letter shall constitute an amendment to each and every governing document for each and every plan, agreement or arrangement under which I may have a right to payments and benefits to reflect the relevant terms and conditions of this letter. This letter shall take effect upon the signing of the Merger Agreement and thereafter shall not be revocable except upon the termination of the Merger Agreement in connection with the abandonment of the transactions contemplated thereby. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, this letter agreement shall have no further force or effect. 

  

 I acknowledge that this letter will serve as an inducement to HCBK to execute, enter into and perform the Merger Agreement and that HCBK is relying on the promises that I have made herein in deciding to proceed therewith. 

  

 Very truly yours,
