sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _ **Surviving Corporation**_."

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, (i) the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read in the form of

and (ii) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the

(d) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds,

**Closing**_ ") shall take place as soon as practicable after, but in any
event no later than three (3) Business Days after, the date of the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the

 **ARTICLE II EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK**

  



  

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub or the
Company:

  



  

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of capital stock
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation (" _ **Surviving Corporation Stock**_ "), and all such
shares together with any shares issued in respect of Converted Shares pursuant
to _Section_ _2.1(b)_ shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation or Conversion of Certain Shares_. Each share of Common
Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock, or owned by Parent Sub or Merger
Sub, in each case immediately before the Effective Time (collectively, the " _
**Excluded Shares**_ "), shall be canceled automatically, be extinguished and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid for those Excluded
Shares. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or any direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Parent (other than Parent Sub or Merger Sub) or of the Company
(the " _ **Converted**_ _ **Shares**_ ") shall be converted into such number
of shares of Surviving Corporation Stock such that the ownership percentage of
any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation shall equal the ownership
percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_.

  



  

(i) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares, Converted Shares and
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted by virtue of the Merger automatically
into and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive $12.12 payable
net to the seller in cash, without interest (the " _ **Merger Consideration**_
") subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, in
accordance with _Section 2.2_.

  



  

(ii) All shares of Common Stock that have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)(i)_ shall be canceled automatically and shall be extinguished
and cease to exist, and the holders of (A) certificates which immediately
before the Effective Time represented such Shares (the " _ **Certificates**_
") or (B) Shares represented by book-entry immediately before the Effective
Time (the " _ **Book-Entry Shares**_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect to those Shares, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2_ and (subject to _Section 5.1_ )
any dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective
Time which may have been authorized by the Company and which are payable but
remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Equitable Adjustment_. If at any time during the period between the
Agreement Date and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock shall occur as a result of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with
respect to the Common Stock, then the Merger Consideration and any other
amount based on the number of shares of Common Stock shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this
_Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any other Person to take any action that is otherwise prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

2.2 _Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than three (3) Business Days before the
Effective Time, Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company, reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to act as agent for the Company Stockholders to
receive the aggregate Merger Consideration to which they shall have become
entitled to pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ (the " _ **Paying Agent**_ "),
(ii) enter into a depositary and paying agent agreement with the Paying and
Depositary Agent in customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company. The
Company shall be responsible for all Expenses of the Paying Agent.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) _Payment Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, for payment in accordance
with this _Article II_ through the Paying Agent, sufficient funds for the
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)(i)_ ) (excluding payments with respect to Dissenting Shares, Converted
Shares and Excluded Shares). Such funds provided to the Paying Agent are
referred to as the " _ **Payment Fund**_." The Payment Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to be
paid in the Merger.

  



  

(c) _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, but no later than five (5) Business Days following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each Person who was, at the Effective Time and other than in respect of any
Excluded Shares or Converted Shares, a holder of record of Shares converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(along with any other terms and provisions as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree), specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to such holder's Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof, in accordance with
_Section 2.2(d)_ , if applicable) and a properly completed (and validly
executed) letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon a customary agent's message, and (B) instructions for
surrendering such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration (less any required withholding of Taxes) issuable and payable in
respect of such Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

  



  

(ii) _Surrender of Shares_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.2(d)_ , if
applicable) or of a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and any other documents
reasonably required pursuant to the instructions thereto or reasonably
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Paying Agent
shall promptly pay in exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the number of Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificates or
such BookEntry Shares less any required withholding of Taxes. Any Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be canceled immediately. No
interest shall accrue or be paid on any amount payable upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Merger Consideration is to be
paid and issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, then the Merger
Consideration may be paid or issued to such a transferee so long as (A) the
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be properly
endorsed and presented to the Paying Agent or shall otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and is accompanied by all documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment
or issuance (1) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (2) establishes to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that all such transfer
Taxes have already been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and
other similar Taxes described in this _Section 2.2(c)_ under any circumstance.
Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered.

  



  

   

  



  

(iv) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this
_Section_ _2.2(c)_ , each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share in respect of
Shares converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)(i)_ shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to the
Surviving Corporation's obligation (subject to _Section 5.1_ ) to pay any
dividends or other distributions with a record and payment date prior to the
Effective Time which may have been authorized by the Company and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. The Merger Consideration paid and issued upon
the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with the
terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share and, in the case of a Certificate, the Shares formerly represented by
it.

  



  

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder of the Shares formerly represented by the Stock Certificate claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by the Surviving Corporation (including if requested by the Paying Agent), the
execution and delivery by such Person of a customary indemnity agreement to
provide indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay (less any amounts entitles to
be deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_ ) the Merger
Consideration to such Person in respect of the Shares formerly represented by
such Stock Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article II_.

  



  

(e) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(f) _Required Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement
(including any amounts payable under _Section 2.3_ with respect to the
cancellation of Company Equity Awards) such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _ **Code**_ "), or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to
the appropriate Governmental Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or
withholding was made for all purposes under this Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Payment Fund as directed by Parent; provided, that such investments shall be
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three (3) months. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and at the
risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such
investment shall be for the benefit of Parent, and any amounts in excess of
the aggregate amounts payable under _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ and _Section 2.2_
shall be returned to Parent in accordance with _Section 2.2(i)_ ; provided,
that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of such holders of Shares in the amount of any such losses to the
extent necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ and _Section 2.2_.

  



  

(i) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent
upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
has not complied with this _Article II_ shall look only to Parent, which shall
remain responsible for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

2.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _EMI Options_. In the event that the EMI Optionholder has not
exercised all of the EMI Options that may be exercised, pursuant to the terms
of the EMI Option Agreements, on or prior to 5:00 pm (Eastern Time) on the
date which is two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _ **EMI
Option Exercise Deadline**_ "), no further exercise of the EMI Options shall
be permitted, after the EMI Option Exercise Deadline, but, instead, as of the
Effective Time, each EMI Option that is outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder
of that EMI Option, shall be canceled, extinguished and converted into the
right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation promptly following
the Effective Time an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the EMI
Option Consideration (as defined below) multiplied by the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock subject to such EMI Option immediately before the
Effective Time; provided, that any such EMI Option with a per share exercise
price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
canceled for no consideration. " _ **EMI**_ _**Option Consideration**_ " means
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise
price of the applicable EMI Option.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each Company
Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
(including, for the purposes hereof, 50,256 Restricted Shares issued to
directors of the Company), by virtue of the Merger and without any action by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company Restricted Share
shall be vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse in full as of
immediately before the Effective Time; and each such Company Restricted Share
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without interest, equal in value to
the Merger Consideration (the " _ **Restricted Share Consideration**_ ").

  



  

(c) _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Company
Board administering the MAM Software Group, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
and the MAM Software Group Share Incentive Plan (each, a " _ **Company ESPP**_
")) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required
to provide that each Company ESPP (i) shall be suspended as of the date of
this Agreement and no offering period shall be commenced after the date of
this Agreement unless the Merger is not consummated, (ii) each participant's
outstanding right to purchase Shares under each Company ESPP shall terminate
as of the date of this Agreement, (iii) all amounts allocated to each
participant's account under each Company ESPP, as of the Agreement Date, shall
thereupon be returned to each such participant, and (iv) each Company ESPP
shall terminate immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time
occurs (if not earlier terminated by the Company Board).

  



  

(d) _Withholding; Termination of Company Equity Plans_. The payment of
the amounts set forth in _Section 2.3(a)_ and _Section 2.3(b)_ in respect of
the Company Equity Awards shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax
withholding required under the Code or any applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having
been paid to the holder of that Company Equity Award for all purposes under
this Agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts so that all
Company Equity Awards shall be canceled and all Company Equity Plans shall
terminate at the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) _Maintenance of Sufficient Funds_. The Surviving Corporation shall,
at all times from and after the Effective Time, maintain sufficient liquid
funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of Company Equity Awards pursuant
to this _Section 2.3_.

  



  

(f) _Payment of EMI Option Consideration and Restricted Share
Consideration_. On the next (occurring at least five (5) Business Days after
the Closing Date) scheduled payroll distribution date (consistent with the
Company's past practice) following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay through its payroll system (i) to each applicable
holder of an EMI Option, in such amount due and payable to such holder the EMI
Option Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ in respect of such EMI
Option and (ii) to each applicable holder of a Company Restricted Share (other
than with respect to any Company Restricted Shares held by directors of the
Company Board who are not also employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, which, for clarity, will be paid in accordance with the procedures
for Common Stock), in such amount due and payable to such holder the
Restricted Shares Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ in respect of
such Company Restricted Share.

  



  

   

  



  

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other provisions of this _Section_ _2.4_ ), any shares of
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and for which the holder thereof is entitled to demand and
properly demands the appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and complies
in all respects with, the DGCL (collectively, the " _ **Dissenting Shares**_
"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Section_ _2.1(c)_ but instead shall be entitled to payment
of the value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At the
Effective Time, (A) all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled, extinguished and
cease to exist and (B) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only
to such rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ _2.4(a)_ , if any holder
of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holder's Shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares
or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal, in each case, in accordance with _Section_
_2.2_.

  



  

(c) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in any event within
one (1) Business Day) of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, any
withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instrument
served on the Company relating to Company Stockholders' appraisal rights.
Parent shall have the opportunity and right to (i) at Parent's election, to
direct, control or participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other actions with respect of Company Stockholders' rights for
appraisal, and (ii) have a reasonable opportunity to review, and have the
Company consider in good faith all reasonable comments to, any written
document to be given to any third party or Governmental Authority in
connection therewith. The Company shall not offer to make or make any payment
with respect to any such demands for appraisal, or compromise or settle or
offer to compromise or settle, any such demands for appraisal, or approve any
withdrawal of such demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or otherwise comply with the provisions under Section 262
of the DGCL, or commit or agree to do any of the foregoing, without the prior
written consent of Parent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not,
except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or compromise or
settle or offer to compromise or settle, any such demands for appraisal or
commit or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Except (A) as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
Company Disclosure Schedules (subject to _Section_ _8.13_ ), or (B) as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (other than any disclosures contained
or referenced therein under the captions "Risk Factors," "Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," and any other disclosures contained or

cautionary or forward-looking in nature) and publicly available at least two

_Section_ _3.1_ , _Section_ _3.2_ , _Section_ _3.3_ , _Section_ _3.4_ ,
_Section_ _3.6_ and the first sentence of _Section_ _3.10_ _)_ (it being (i)
understood that any matter disclosed in any Company SEC Documents will be

to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from such disclosure in such
Company SEC Documents that it is applicable to such section of the Company
Disclosure Schedules; and (ii) acknowledged that nothing disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents will be deemed to modify or qualify the representations
and warranties set forth in this _Article_ _ARTICLE_ _III_ ), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

3.1 _Existence; Good Standing_.

  



  

(a) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is a corporation,
limited liability company or other legal entity validly existing and in good
standing (or equivalent concept to the extent applicable) under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign legal entity
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the assets and properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent accurate and complete copies of the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other comparable organizational and governing
documents of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including all
amendments thereto, as in effect on the Agreement Date, and each as so
delivered is in full force and effect. The Company is not in violation of its
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. The Company Subsidiaries are not in
violation in any material respect of their respective organizational or
governing documents.

  



  

   

  



  

3.2 _Authorization; Enforceability_.

  



  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority, and has
taken all corporate action necessary, to enter into this Agreement and perform
its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The Company
Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has, by resolutions duly adopted at
such meeting: (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair
to and in the best interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (ii)
declared it advisable for the Company to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, (iii) authorized and

withdrawn or modified as of the time of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and no other corporate or stockholder proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions (other than (x) obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, and
(y) the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL).

  



  

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other
Parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The Company has made
available to Parent, as of the Agreement Date, a true, correct and complete
copy of any resolutions adopted by the Company Board or any committee thereof
relating to the Merger. The adoption of this Agreement by a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock at a meeting of the stockholders of the
Company or by written consent of stockholders holding a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock in lieu of a meeting is the only vote of
the holders of any of the Company's Common Stock necessary in connection with
the consummation of the Merger (the " _ **Company Stockholder Approval**_ ").

  



  

3.3 _Capitalization_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of: (i)
18,000,000 shares of Common Stock; and (ii) 2,000,000 shares of Preferred

the parent or otherwise in each case in the sole discretion of the Financing
Sources) in an amount up to the aggregate amount set forth therein in
connection with the Transactions (the " _ **Equity**_ _**Financing**_ ").

to Merger Sub or otherwise in each case in the sole discretion of the Parent))
available funds in an amount sufficient to pay in cash the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable following the Effective Time, the aggregate amounts
payable to holders of Company Equity Awards following the Effective Time

agreements.

made by Parent and/or Merger Sub, under the provisions of this Agreement, the
Company agrees that the Equity Financing may be reduced on a US Dollar for US

release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, or
court process. The Company and Parent agree that the initial press release to

(including in connection with the access provisions of _Section_ _5.5_ hereof)
and the transactions contemplated hereby as confidential in accordance with
the terms of the Nondisclosure Agreement by and between the Company and Parent
dated May 17, 2019 (the " _ **Nondisclosure Agreement**_ "). The Nondisclosure
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which
time the Nondisclosure Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is, for
any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Nondisclosure Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect, subject to _Section_ _5.5_ hereafter.

  



  

5.5 _Access to Information_. Subject to _Section_ _5.4_ hereof, from the
Agreement Date until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, afford the Representatives and other agents of Parent
(provided, that Parent shall cause such Representatives and other agents to
treat any information gained thereby as confidential) reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance written notice, and
subject to reasonable rules and regulations of the Company, to (a) the
Specified Company Employees and, with the prior written consent of a Specified
Company Employee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), any of the other employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to which any Specified Company Employee provides his consent, (b)
the properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and (c) to the extent not prohibited by Law, all books and
records, and all financial, operating, Tax and other data and information,
with respect to the Business that are in the possession of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case, as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided, however,_ (i) if the Company so requires, Parent's representatives
conducting any physical inspection of the properties, offices or other
facilities of the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
accompanied by one or more representatives of the Company and (ii) the Company
shall not be required to provide any such access to the extent that it would
require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to (A) disclose
information subject to attorney-client privilege as advised by the Company's
outside counsel (after taking into account the potential for a "continuity of
interest" or similar agreement; provided, that, in any event, the Company will
disclose to Parent that it is withholding information in reliance upon this
_Section_ _5.5_ ), (B) disclose information that would cause significant
competitive harm to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, (C) violate
applicable Law, or (D) violate any confidentiality obligations to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is bound; provided, that the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide any such information in a
manner and to the maximum extent such clauses (A) through (D) shall not apply.
All requests for such access shall be directed to a Specified Company Employee
or such other Person as the Company may designate in writing to Parent from
time to time. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the
Closing, without the express prior written consent of the Company, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor
any of their Representatives or other agents shall contact any customers to,
or vendors or suppliers of, the Company, or shall have any right to perform
sampling or any invasive or subsurface investigations of any properties or
facilities of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. In exercising
its rights hereunder, Parent shall, and shall cause its advisors,
representatives, officers, directors, employees, auditors and other agents to
conduct themselves so as not to unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the
Business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

  



  

   

  



  

5.6 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate
and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill as
promptly as practicable the conditions precedent to the Parties' obligations
hereunder that are within their respective control and to seek any third-party
consents and give any notices to third parties that may be required pursuant
to the terms of any Contract (provided, that the Company shall not pay or
agree to pay any amounts or waive any rights or amend or modify any terms in
order to obtain such third-party consents without the prior written consent of
Parent).

  



  

5.7 _Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) After the Effective Time, all rights to exculpation, indemnification
and reimbursement and advancement of expenses, and all limitations on
liability, existing in favor of any current or former officer or member of the
board of directors (or comparable governing body) of the Company and/or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(collectively, the " _ **Company Indemnitees**_ "), as provided in the
certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and/or in any agreements or
arrangements of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries set forth on
_Schedule 5.7(a)_ providing for similar rights and limitations in favor of any
of the Company Indemnitees, in any such case as in effect as of immediately
prior to the Agreement Date, shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect, and
the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries shall honor all such
rights and limitations after the Effective Time in accordance with their
terms. All such rights of exculpation, indemnification and reimbursement and
advancement of expenses, and all such limitations on liability, shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company
Indemnitee without the consent of such affected Company Indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitees shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ _5.7_ ).

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, obtain, maintain and fully pay for
irrevocable "tail" officers' and directors' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance policies naming the Company Indemnitees as direct
beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six (6) years after the Closing
Date in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective
Time, such insurance policies to contain terms with respect to coverage and to
be in an amount not less favorable than the officers' and directors' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies maintained by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the Agreement Date and shall be
reviewed by, and approved in advance by, the Company (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In satisfying its
obligations pursuant to this _Section_ _5.7(b)_ , the Surviving Corporation
will not be obligated to pay an aggregate premium in excess of 300% of the
amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such
300% amount, the " _ **Maximum Premium**_ "). If the aggregate annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, then the Surviving
Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former directors
and officers than are presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Company in effect as of the Agreement Date, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that is adverse to an Company Indemnitee for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals.

  



  

(d) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns,
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its applicable
Subsidiary (or their respective successors and assigns) shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ _5.7_.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any proceeding
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) with respect to which
a Company Indemnitee would be entitled to rights to exculpation,
indemnification, reimbursement and advancement of expenses and any limitations
on liability under the applicable certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
other organizational documents of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, and/or in any agreements or arrangements of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries providing for similar rights and limitations in
favor of any of the Company Indemnitees, is made against any Company
Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions and benefits of this _Section_ _5.7_ shall continue in full
effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

  



  

(f) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which a Company Indemnitee is entitled, whether
pursuant to applicable Law or Contract. The provisions of this _Section_ _5.7_
shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the
contrary, and expressly are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Company Indemnitees and their respective heirs and legal
representatives.

  



  

   

  



  

5.8 _Updates and Notifications_.

  



  

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement, pursuant to the provisions of _Article_
_ARTICLE_ _VII_ , and the Effective Time, the Company will give prompt written
notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made
by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the
extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no
such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation,
warranty covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement or
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement.

notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty
made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each
case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of
the Company to consummate the Merger to fail to be satisfied at the Closing,
except that no such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement.

Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries who have experienced, or to the

5.13 _Employment and Company Benefits_.

  



  

(a) During the one (1) year period immediately following the Closing Date
(or until the termination of employment of the relevant Company Employee, if
sooner), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to
each Company Employee, (i) substantially similar or greater in the aggregate
base salary and target annual cash bonus opportunity (excluding cash long-term
incentive and other broad-based equity-based incentive compensation) either
(at Parent's election in its sole discretion) (A) provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date or (B) provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries and (ii) other employee
benefits (excluding deferred compensation, defined benefit and cash long-term
incentive and equity or equity-based incentive opportunities and excluding any
severance benefits and post termination or retiree health or welfare benefits
(or, if earlier, the termination date of an applicable Company Employee))
that, with respect to each Company Employee, are substantially similar or
greater in the aggregate to the benefits provided either (at Parent's election
in its sole discretion) (A) to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date under the Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule_ _3.18(a)_
or (B) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, as of the Closing, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply with the terms of all
employment agreements covering Company Employees. " _ **Company Employee**_ "

following the Closing.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall provide each Company Employee whose
employment is involuntarily terminated other than for cause during the one (1)
year period immediately following the Closing Date with severance benefits
that are no less favorable than the severance benefits which such employee

agreements covering Company Employees as set forth on _Schedule_ _3.14(a)_.

  



  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to give

successor arrangement of Parent or an Affiliate to a Company Benefit Plan in
which such employees participate after the Closing during the plan year in
which Closing occurs and (ii) determination of benefit levels under any
continuing Company Benefit Plan or any successor arrangement of Parent or an
Affiliate to a Company Benefit Plan providing vacation, paid time off and
severance benefits during the plan year in which Closing occurs, in each case
to the extent that such service would have been recognized by the Company
Benefit Plan prior to Closing and except where such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits or result in credit for periods not recognized under
the terms of a similar Parent or Affiliate benefit arrangement for an employee
of Parent or an Affiliate.

  



  

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take
commercially reasonable efforts to, for the plan year in which the Closing

employees as of the Closing Date under the analogous Company Benefit Plan;
(ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by
the Company Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in
which they participated immediately prior to the Closing Date during the
portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of
Parent or any of its Affiliates in which they are eligible to participate
after the Closing Date in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred; and (iii) waive any health
plan waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that
would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his or her eligible
dependents on or after the Closing Date, in each case to the extent such
Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing contained herein,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Company Employee or any
other Person any benefits under any benefit plans, programs, policies or other
arrangements, and the provisions of this _Section_ _5.13_ are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall
(i) create any right in any employee of the Company to continued employment by
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates,
or any particular term or condition of service or employment, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates from terminating the employment or service of any employee or other
Person for any or no reason; (ii) require Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to continue any Company Benefit Plan or

terminate the Company's 401(k) plan and to fully vest all participants under
such 401(k) plan, such termination and vesting to be effective no later than
the day preceding the Closing Date; _provided_ , however, that the termination
of such 401(k) plan may be made contingent upon the Closing. The Company shall
provide Parent with an advance copy of such proposed resolutions (any related
documents) and a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon prior to adoption
or execution. Parent agrees to see to, or agrees that Surviving Corporation
will see to, the liquidation of any such terminated 401(k) plan as soon as
reasonably practicable. Parent shall further cause its 401(k) plan to accept
rollover contributions of all amounts distributed from the Company's 401(k)
plan, including any loans receivable.

  



  

(g) The Company shall cause each officer named in Schedule 5.13(g) to, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Agreement Date (and in any event
prior to Closing) execute and deliver in favor of the Company a valid
agreement pursuant to which such officer agrees (i) that he is personally
responsible for the payment of all federal, state and local taxes that are
due, or may be due, in connection with Company Equity Awards that have been
issued to such person and (ii) to indemnify the Company and hold the Company

5.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. Unless and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with the provisions of _Article_ _ARTICLE VII_
hereafter, and except to the extent as would be reasonably expected to violate
or result in a loss of any attorney-client privilege, the Company shall
promptly notify Parent in writing of any stockholder litigation that is
brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened, against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and/or the members of the board of directors
or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, relating to this
Agreement, the Merger and any of the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement and shall on an ongoing basis keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding and consult with Parent with respect to any such stockholder
litigation; provided, that none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any of its or their respective Representatives shall compromise, settle, come
to an arrangement regarding, or make any disclosure requested in connection
with, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any
such stockholder litigation or consent to the same unless Parent shall have
consented in writing. Parent shall have the opportunity and right, at Parent's
sole cost and expense to (i) at Parent's election, either control or
participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to any such
stockholder litigation and (ii) have a reasonable opportunity to review, and
have the Company consider in good faith all reasonable comments to, any
written document to be given to any third party or Governmental Authority in
connection therewith.

  



  

   

  



  

5.15 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to
the Merger or the other Transactions, the Company and the Company Board shall
grant such approvals and take all such actions as are necessary or advisable
so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Law on the Transactions. The approval of the
Company Board for purposes of causing any Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
irrevocable and unconditional and no Adverse Recommendation Change or other
action shall change such approval.

  



  

5.16 _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and
shall cause the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any direct or
indirect solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with
any Person that may be ongoing with respect to any proposal that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, and shall
(i) promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the
Agreement Date) request that each Person (and all Affiliates or

potential Acquisition Proposal in the last twelve (12) months prior to the
Agreement Date, promptly return or destroy all such confidential information
and (ii) immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access
previously granted to any such Person, its Affiliates or Representatives. The
Company shall not, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries not to,
terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill or
confidentiality agreement to which it or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a
party, and the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to,
enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided, however,_ that the
Company may grant a waiver of, and shall not be obligated to enforce, any such
provision if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in
good faith, following consultation with Company Counsel and/or any other
reputable and nationally-recognized outside legal counsel chosen by the
Company, that the failure to grant such waiver would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ _5.16_ , during the
period between the Agreement Date and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article_ _ARTICLE_ _VII_ , the Company agrees that it shall

Company's organizational and other governing documents (including under
Section 203 of the DGCL), or adopt a "poison pill" or any similar plan or
arrangement or (vii) resolve to do or publicly announce any of the foregoing;
_provided, however,_ that, at any time prior to (but not after) the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a written Acquisition Proposal that has
not been withdrawn, which Acquisition Proposal was not solicited by the
Company and did not result from a breach of this _Section_ _5.16_ , subject to
compliance with this _Section_ _5.16_ and only if (x) the Company Board (1)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its reputable and
nationally-recognized financial advisors and Company Counsel and/or any other
reputable and nationally-recognized outside legal counsel chosen by the
Company) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to
result in, a Superior Proposal, (2) determines in good faith (after

respect to such withheld information and data), **** in which case, such
disclosure shall be pursuant to customary "clean-room" or other appropriate
procedures) and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such

Bidder**_ ") any non-public information or data that has not been provided to
Parent by the Company or its Representatives prior to the Agreement Date
unless such information or data is material and is as a result of an event,
fact or circumstance occurring after the Agreement Date.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) calendar
day) (i) provide Parent written notice of (A) the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or (B) any inquiries, proposals or offers received by, or any
discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, or any

to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) disclose to Parent the identity of
such Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, all terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, if any (and any amendments thereto), and an
unredacted copy of, any such Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry, offer,
proposal or request made in writing (or, if made orally, a reasonably detailed

or request), and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the
status of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company shall, promptly
upon receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event within one (1) calendar
day), provide Parent (and its outside counsel) with copies of versions of
definitive or other agreements including schedules and exhibits thereto (which
may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal) relating to such Acquisition
Proposal, in each case exchanged between the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any of its or their Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making

chosen by the Company that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal or
that an Intervening Event has occurred, notify Parent of such determination.
The Company shall provide Parent with an accurate and complete copy of any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into within one (1) calendar day
of execution thereof.

  



  

(d) Except as expressly permitted by in _Section_ _5.16(e)_ , neither the
Company, any Company Subsidiary nor the Company Board (or any committee
thereof), shall, and neither shall publicly propose to: (i) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,

or (vi) take any action or make any statement inconsistent with the Company
Board Recommendation (any such action, other than those set forth in the
preceding clause (iii), an " _ **Adverse Recommendation Change**_ ").

  



  

   

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to (but not after) Company Stockholder Approval, and so long as the
Company is not in breach of this _Section_ _5.16_ , the Company Board may
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change (excluding, in the case of an
Intervening Event, clauses (ii) and (iv) of the definition of Adverse
Recommendation Change) (or solely in respect of the immediately following
clause (i), cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ _7.4_ by written notice to Parent of such termination), if (i) the
Company receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that has not been
withdrawn and that did not result from a breach of _Section_ _5.16_ and the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its reputable
and nationally-recognized financial advisors, Company Counsel and/or any other
reputable and nationally-recognized and outside legal counsel chosen by the
Company) is a Superior Proposal and determines in good faith (after
consultation with Company Counsel and/or any other reputable and nationally-
recognized outside legal counsel chosen by the Company) that its failure to
take such actions would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or (ii) an Intervening Event occurs and as a result thereof the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with Company
Counsel and/or any other reputable and nationally-recognized outside legal
counsel chosen by the Company) that the failure to effect such an Adverse
Recommendation Change would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; provided, that:

  



  

(i) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect
to a Superior Proposal, (A) the Company has provided Parent with at least five
(5) Business Days' prior written notice (which notice shall constitute a " _
**Determination Notice**_ ") that it will effect such an Adverse
Recommendation Change, (B) the Company has provided Parent the information
that is specified in _Section_ _5.16(c)_ with respect to such Superior
Proposal, (C) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of five (5)
Business Days following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have
discussed and negotiated in good faith and on an exclusive basis, and shall
have made the Representatives of the Company available to discuss and
negotiate in good faith and on an exclusive basis, with Parent and its
Representatives, any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and (D) no earlier than 11:59 p.m. New York City
time at the end of such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board (after
consultation with its reputable and nationally-recognized financial advisors,
Company Counsel and/or any other reputable and nationally-recognized outside
legal counsel chosen by the Company) shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Parent during such five (5) Business Day period, that
such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to make such an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection therewith
would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it
being understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other terms
(other than _de minimis_ non-financial terms) of an Acquisition Proposal that
was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to
Parent as provided above and require the Company to again comply with the
requirements of this _Section_ _5.16(e)(i)_ ) with respect to any such new
notice); and

  



  

   

  



  

(ii) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect
to an Intervening Event, (A) the Company has notified (which notice shall also
constitute a " _ **Determination Notice**_ ") Parent in writing that it will
effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable detail
the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) if requested to do so
by Parent, for a period of five (5) Business Days following delivery of such
notice, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith, and
shall have made the Representatives of the Company available to discuss and
negotiate in good faith and on an exclusive basis, with Parent and its
Representatives any bona fide proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (C) no earlier than 11:59 p.m. New York City
time at the end of such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board shall
have again determined in good faith, after giving effect to any proposed
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such
five (5) Business Day period and after consultation with Company Counsel
and/or any other reputable and nationally-recognized outside legal counsel
chosen by the Company, that the failure to effect such an Adverse
Recommendation Change would still reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that any change to the facts, event, circumstances,
changes, effects, developments or conditions subject of a notice hereunder
shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above and require the Company
to again comply with the requirements of this _Section_ _5.16(e)(ii)_ with
respect to any such new notice).

  



  

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
the holders of Shares if the Company Board determines (after consultation with
Company Counsel and/or any other reputable and nationally-recognized outside
legal counsel chosen by the Company) that its failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided,_ that,
in each case, any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance
with _Section_ _5.16(e)_.

  



  

   

  



  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) " _ **Acquisition Proposal**_ " means any bona fide written proposal
or offer from any Person or "group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act) of Persons (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Affiliates) (an " _ **Acquisition Group**_ ") that is not subject
to diligence (or, if subject to the completion of due diligence, the Company
Board (or an authorized committee thereof) has reasonably determined that such
diligence would reasonably be expected to be completed prior to the Effective
Time and, after completion of diligence, such proposal or offer would
reasonably be expected to constitute a Superior Proposal for a transaction or
series of related transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) involving: (i) the purchase or other acquisition by any Person
or Acquisition Group, directly or indirectly, of more than twenty percent
(20%) of the outstanding shares of Equity Securities of the Company, or any
tender offer or exchange offer by any Person or Acquisition Group that, if
consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such Person or
Acquisition Group beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than
twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of Equity Securities of the
Company; (ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, reorganization,
partnership, joint venture, business combination or other similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than eighty percent (80%) of
the equity interests or voting equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction; (iii) a sale, transfer, acquisition, or
disposition, directly or indirectly, of more than twenty percent (20%) of the
consolidated assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (whether measured by the fair market value thereof or based on the
revenue generation of, or net income related to, such assets); or (iv) a
liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company.

  



  

(ii) " _ **Intervening Event**_ " means any material positive event,
circumstance, change, effect, development or condition (other than an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), that is material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and was not known or reasonably
foreseeable by the Company Board or the officers of the Company as of the
Agreement Date, which becomes known to the Company Board prior to the
Effective Time and did not arise from the operation of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course of Business; _provided, however_ ,
that in no event shall (A) any action taken by the Parties pursuant to or in
compliance with this Agreement, (B) any changes in Law or the commencement,
continuance or settlement of any Action, (C) changes in the market price or
trading volume of the shares of Common Stock in and of themselves, (D) the
fact, in and of itself, that the Company or any Company Subsidiary meets,
exceeds or fails to meet internal or published projections, forecasts or
revenue or earnings predictions for any period, (E) a change in the general
conditions in the industries in which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
operate or (F) any event, development or change relating solely to Parent or
its Affiliates, in each case, constitute an "Intervening Event."

  



  

   

  



  

(iii) " _ **Superior Proposal**_ " means any _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal that includes a proposed purchase agreement with respect thereto or
confirms in writing that any purchase agreement in connection therewith will
be on substantially the same terms as this Agreement that is not withdrawn and
is not subject to any diligence that is made by a third party after the
Agreement Date, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of
this _Section_ _5.16_ , (A) that would result in a third party acquiring,
directly or indirectly, (1) 100% of the voting power of the Equity Securities
of the Company, (2) assets that generate 100% of the consolidated total
revenues or operating income of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (3) assets that constitute 100% of the consolidated total
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other
than cash or de minimis assets), (B) is on terms which the Company Board
determines (after consultation with its reputable and nationally-recognized
financial advisors and Company Counsel and/or any other reputable and
nationally-recognized outside legal counsel chosen by the Company) to be more
favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of Common
Stock than the Transactions, taking into account all the terms and conditions
of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend
the terms of this Agreement) and the financial, financing, conditionality,
timing, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal (including the
financing, which must be fully committed) and the Person making the proposal,
and (C) that the Company Board determines (after consultation with its
reputable and nationally-recognized financial advisors and Company Counsel
and/or any other reputable and nationally-recognized outside legal counsel
chosen by the Company) is reasonably likely (and at least as likely as the
Merger) to be consummated in accordance with its terms in a reasonable period
of time (as compared to the Transactions), taking into account all the
financial, financing, conditionality, timing, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal (including certainty of closing, certainty of
financing and the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal of
such proposal. An Acquisition Proposal that (i) contains a financing or
funding condition, restricts in any way or conditions the ability of the
Company to seek specific performance to cause the transactions contemplated
thereby to be consummated on receipt of funds or compliance with financing
commitments from any Person or otherwise may not be consummated without the
receipt of funds from any Person other than the Person(s) making the
Acquisition Proposal or its or their respective Affiliates, or (ii) offers a
price per share less than the Merger Consideration (as amended) shall, in each
case, be deemed not to be a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(h) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that in the event any
Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary takes any action, on
behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, which, if taken by the
Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section_ _5.16_ , the Company
shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section_ _5.16_.

  



  

5.17 _Further Action_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to promptly do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) obtain from any
Governmental Authority or any other third party any authorizations, consents,
Orders, approvals, licenses, permits or waivers required to be obtained or
made by any of the Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions, as promptly as practicable after the
Agreement Date, and (ii) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any
other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions required under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and
any other applicable federal or state securities Laws, and (C) any other
applicable Law. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any
applicable Law in connection with the Transactions. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent and the Company agree that nothing contained in this _Section_
_5.17(a)_ shall modify or affect their respective rights and responsibilities
under _Section_ _5.17(b)_.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this
_Section_ _5.17_ , each Party shall: (i) give the other Parties prompt notice
of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry or Action by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, (ii) keep the other
Parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry or
Action; and provide a copy of all written communications., and (iii) subject
to applicable Law, consult the other on all the information relating to Parent
or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries
that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions and shall incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by Parent
or the Company, as the case may be; _provided, however_ , that if review of
any information would be material in connection with any second request (or
similar process) such information shall be provided solely to those
individuals acting as outside antitrust counsel for the other Parties
(provided, that such counsel shall not disclose such information to such other
Parties and shall enter into a joint defense agreement with the providing
Party). In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority
or by any applicable Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry or
Action in respect of the Transactions, each Party will permit authorized
Representatives of the other Party to be present at each meeting or conference
relating to such request, inquiry or Action and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with such request,
inquiry or Action.

  



  

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parties hereto agrees to
promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment and obtain all consents under any such Antitrust Laws that may be
required by any Governmental Authority, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the Parties to consummate the Transactions.
Parent shall not consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline
or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the
Transactions at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent
of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
promptly take all reasonable actions necessary to resolve any objections
asserted with respect to the Transactions under any applicable Law raised by
any Governmental Authority, in order to prevent the entry of, any Law or Order
that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the
Transactions; _provided, however_ , that neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall, in any event, be required, to and without the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not (A)
sell, license, divest or dispose of or hold separate any material entities,
assets or businesses of Parent or its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), (B)
terminate, amend or assign existing material relationships or contractual
rights or obligations of Parent or its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), (C)
change or modify any material course of conduct regarding future operations of
Parent or its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), (D) otherwise take actions that would
limit the respective freedom of action of Parent or its Affiliates (including,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries) with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of
their respective material businesses, assets or rights or interests therein,
(E) execute material settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations
or other agreements with any Governmental Authority or with any other Person
or (F) commit to take any such actions in the foregoing clauses (A) through
(E). If any Governmental Authority requires Parent or any of its Affiliates to
take any regulatory action by or with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or asset, and such action would
constitute a breach of this Agreement, the Company may, with the prior written
consent of Parent, take such action. Parent shall respond to and seek to
resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require any Party hereto to take or agree to take, or cause to
be taken, any action with respect to its assets, business or operations unless
the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

  



  

   

  



  

5.18 _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and Representatives to, use
its and their respective reasonable best efforts to provide such information
and cooperation as may be reasonably requested by the Parent in connection
with the arrangement of any financing to be consummated in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement including any
Debt Financing (it being understood that no aspect of such financing is a
condition to the Merger). Parent shall (a) promptly on request of the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees up to an agreed cap (if
any)) incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection
with the co-operation of such persons contemplated in this _Section 5.18_ and
(b) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
its and their respective directors, officers, employees and advisors from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees up to an agreed cap (if any)), interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred solely in connection with
any financing to be consummated in connection with the Merger, including the
Debt Financing or any assistance in connection therewith (other than arising
from fraud or intentional misrepresentations, misstatements or omissions on
the part of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of its or their
respective Affiliates).

  



  

5.19 _Company Term Facility; Company Revolving Facility_. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to
cause the providers of the Company Term Facility, the Company Revolving
Facility and any and all other bonds, credit facilities or other debt
instruments (together the " _ **Debt Documents**_ ") to provide customary
payoff letters, release letters, deeds of release, forms UCC-3 and/or any
other document reasonably requested by the Parent, in connection with Parent's
payment of any such Debt Document (it being agreed and acknowledged by the
Parties that the Company shall have no obligation to make any payments not

Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Information Statement promptly after receipt of those
comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to

 _Article VIII_

  



  

The corporation shall indemnify any person who was, is, or is threatened to be
made a party to a proceeding (as hereinafter defined) by reason of the fact
that he or she (i) is or was a director or officer of the corporation or (ii)
while a director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer,
proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another
foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole
proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, to the
fullest extent permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Such right shall be
a contract right and as such shall run to the benefit of any director or
officer who is elected and accepts the position of director or officer of the
corporation or elects to continue to serve as a director or officer of the
corporation while this Article VIII is in effect. Any repeal or amendment of
this Article VIII shall be prospective only and shall not limit the rights of
any such director or officer or the obligations of the corporation with
respect to any claim arising from or related to the services of such director
or officer in any of the foregoing capacities prior to any such repeal or
amendment to this Article VIII. Such right shall include the right to be paid
by the corporation expenses incurred in investigating or defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the maximum extent permitted
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of
expenses hereunder is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty (60)
days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant
may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the
unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful in whole or in part, the
claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such
claim. It shall be a defense to any such action that such indemnification or
advancement of costs of defense is not permitted under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, but the burden of proving such defense shall be
on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its
board of directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or
stockholders) to have made its determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of, or advancement of costs of defense to, the
claimant is permissible in the circumstances nor an actual determination by
the corporation (including its board of directors or any committee thereof,
independent legal counsel, or stockholders) that such indemnification or
advancement is not permissible shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible. In
the event of the death of any person having a right of indemnification under
the foregoing provisions, such right shall inure to the benefit of his or her
heirs, executors, administrators, and personal representatives. The rights
conferred above shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, by-law, resolution of
stockholders or directors, agreement, or otherwise. As used herein, the term
"proceeding" means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or
investigative, any appeal in such an action, suit, or proceeding, and any
inquiry or investigation that could lead to such an action, suit, or
proceeding.

  



  

To the fullest extent that the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware as it exists on the date hereof, or as it may hereafter be amended,
permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors, no
director of the corporation shall be liable to the corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders of
the corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director of the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or

certificate of incorporation or by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, an annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held each year within
one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of the immediately preceding
fiscal year of the corporation for the purpose of electing directors and
conducting such other proper business as may come before the meeting. The
date, time and place, if any, and/or the means of remote communication, of the

_provided_ , _however_ , that if the president does not act, the board of
directors shall determine the date, time and place, if any, and/or the means
of remote communication, of such meeting. No annual meeting of stockholders
need be held if not required by the corporation\'s certificate of
incorporation or by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

  



  

 _Section 2 Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders may be
called for any purpose (including, without limitation, the filling of board
vacancies and newly created directorships) and may be held at such time and
place, within or without the State of Delaware, and/or by means of remote
communication, as shall be stated in a written notice of meeting or in a duly
executed waiver of notice thereof. Such meetings may be called at any time by
the board of directors or the president and shall be called by the president
upon the written request of holders of shares entitled to cast not less than a
majority of the votes at the meeting, which written request shall state the
purpose or purposes of the meeting and shall be delivered to the president.
The date, time and place, if any, and/or remote communication, of any special
meeting of stockholders shall be determined by the board of directors of the
corporation. On such written request, the president shall fix a date and time
for such meeting within 10 days after receipt of a request for such meeting in
such written request.

  



  

 _Section 3 Place of Meetings_. The board of directors may designate any
place, either within or without the State of Delaware, and/or by means of
remote communication, as the place of meeting for any annual meeting or for

be the principal executive office of the corporation.

  



  

   

  



  

 _Section 4 Notice_. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to
take any action at a meeting, written or printed notice stating the place, if
any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any,
by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person
and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or
purposes, of such meeting, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote
at such meeting and to each director not less than 10 nor more than 60 days
before the date of the meeting. All such notices shall be delivered, either
personally, by mail, or by a form of electronic transmission consented to by
the stockholder to whom the notice is given, by or at the direction of the
board of directors, the president or the secretary, and if mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail,
postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his, her or its address as
the same appears on the records of the corporation. If given by electronic
transmission, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered (a) if by facsimile
telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has
consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an
electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate
notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (1) such
posting and (2) the giving of such separate notice; and (3) if by any other
form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. Any such
consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the
corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (1) the corporation
is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given
by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (2) such inability
becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or
to the transfer agent. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened.

  



  

 _Section 5 Stockholders List_. The officer who has charge of the stock
ledger of the corporation shall make, at least 10 days before every meeting of
the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior
to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided
that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the
notice of the meeting, and/or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the
principal place of business of the corporation. In the event that the
corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network,
the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and
place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by
any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means
of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination
of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

  



  

 _Section 6 Quorum_. The holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock, entitled to vote thereon, present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of
the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the
corporation's certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present, the
holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting, and entitled to vote at the meeting, may adjourn the meeting
to another time and/or place.

  



  

   

  



  

 _Section 7 Adjourned Meetings_. When a meeting is adjourned to another
time and place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time,
place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by
which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and
vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact
any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the
adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting
shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

  



  

 _Section 8 Vote Required_. When a quorum is present, the affirmative
vote of the majority of votes represented by shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter
shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the question is one upon which by
express provisions of an applicable law or of the corporation's certificate of
incorporation a different vote is required, in which case such express
provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.

  



  

 _Section 9 Voting Rights_. Except as otherwise provided by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or by the corporation's certificate
of incorporation or any amendments thereto and subject to Section 3 of Article
VI hereof, every stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be
entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of common stock held
by such stockholder.

  



  

 _Section 10 Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after
three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A
duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable
and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law
to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of
whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock
itself or an interest in the corporation generally. Any proxy is suspended
when the person executing the proxy is present at a meeting of stockholders
and elects to vote, except that when such proxy is coupled with an interest
and the fact of the interest appears on the face of the proxy, the agent named
in the proxy shall have all voting and other rights referred to in the proxy,
notwithstanding the presence of the person executing the proxy. At each
meeting of the stockholders, and before any voting commences, all proxies
filed at or before the meeting shall be submitted to and examined by the
secretary or a person designated by the secretary, and no shares may be
represented or voted under a proxy that has been found to be invalid or
irregular.

  



  

 _Section 11 Action by Written Consent_ Unless otherwise provided in the
corporation's certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at
any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any
action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without
a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken
and bearing the dates of signature of the stockholders who signed the consent
or consents, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not
less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or
take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery
to its registered office in the state of Delaware, or the corporation\'s
principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having
custody of the book or books in which proceedings of meetings of the
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporation\'s registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested or by reputable overnight courier service. All consents properly
delivered in accordance with this section shall be deemed to be recorded when
so delivered. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate
action referred to therein unless, within 60 days after the earliest dated
consent delivered to the corporation as required by this section, written
consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such
corporate action are so recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate
action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given
to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. Any action taken
pursuant to such written consent or consents of the stockholders shall have
the same force and effect as if taken by the stockholders at a meeting
thereof.

  



  

   

  



  

Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may
be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all
purposes for which the original writing could be used; provided that such
copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the
entire original writing.

  



  

 _Section 12 Action by Facsimile, Email or Other Electronic Transmission
Consent_. A facsimile, email or other electronic transmission by a stockholder
or proxyholder (or by any person authorized to act on such person's behalf) of
a proxy or a written consent to an action to be taken (including the delivery
of such a document in the .pdf, .tif, .gif, .peg or similar format attached to
an email message) shall be deemed to be written, signed, dated and delivered
to the corporation for the purposes of this Article; _provided_ that any such
facsimile, email or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered
with information from which the corporation can determine (A) that the
facsimile, email or other electronic transmission was transmitted by the
stockholder or proxyholder or by a person authorized to act for the
stockholder or proxyholder and (B) the date on which such stockholder or
proxyholder or authorized person transmitted such facsimile, email or other
electronic transmission. The date on which such facsimile, email or other
electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which
such consent or proxy was signed. Any such facsimile, email or other
electronic transmission of a consent or proxy shall be treated in all respects
as an original executed consent or proxy and shall be considered to have the
same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of the board of directors or the secretary
of the corporation, each stockholder, proxyholder or other authorized person
who delivered a consent or proxy by facsimile, email or other electronic
transmission shall re-execute the original form thereof **** and deliver such
original to the corporation at its registered office in the State of Delaware,
its principal place of business or to an officer or agent of the corporation
having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders
are recorded. No consent given by facsimile, email or other electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is
reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the
corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its
principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having
custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are
recorded.

a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
Whenever the holders of any class or series are entitled to elect one or more
directors by the provisions of the corporation\'s certificate of
incorporation, the provisions of this section shall apply, in respect to the
removal without cause of a director or directors so elected, to the vote of
the holders of the outstanding shares of that class or series and not to the
vote of the outstanding shares as a whole. Any director may resign at any time
upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the corporation.

  



  

 _Section 4 Vacancies_. Except as otherwise provided in the corporation's
certificate of incorporation, board vacancies and newly created directorships

quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Each director so chosen shall hold
office until a successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her
earlier death, resignation or removal as herein provided. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such vacancy shall automatically reduce the authorized number
of directors _pro_ _tanto_ , until such time as the holders of outstanding
shares of capital stock who are entitled to elect the director whose office is
vacant shall have exercised their right to elect a director to fill such
vacancy, whereupon the authorized number of directors shall be automatically

electronic transmission.

  



  

 _Section 7 Quorum, Required Vote and Adjournment_. A majority of the
total number of directors then in office authorized shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business. The vote of a majority directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of
directors. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the board of
directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum
shall be present.

committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation, which
to the extent provided in such resolution or these by-laws shall have and may
exercise the powers of the board of directors in the management and affairs of
the corporation, except as otherwise limited by law. The board of directors
may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who
may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.
Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be
determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the board of directors.
Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same
to the board of directors when required.

  



  

   

  



  

 _Section 9 Committee Rules_. Each committee of the board of directors
may fix its own rules of procedure and shall hold its meetings as provided by
such rules, except as may otherwise be provided by a resolution of the board
of directors designating such committee. Unless otherwise provided in such a
resolution, the presence of a majority of the members of the committee then in
office shall be necessary to constitute a quorum. In the event that a member
and that member\'s alternate, if alternates are designated by the board of
directors as provided in Section 8 of this Article III, of such committee is
or are absent or disqualified, the member or members thereof present at any
meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or
members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the
board of directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or
disqualified member.

  



  

 _Section 10 Communications Equipment_. Members of the board of directors
or any committee thereof may participate in and act at any meeting of such
board or committee by means of conference telephone or other communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and participation in the meeting pursuant to this section shall
constitute presence in person at the meeting.

  



  

 _Section 11 Waiver of Notice and Presumption of Assent_. Any member of
the board of directors or any committee thereof who is present at a meeting
shall be conclusively presumed to have waived notice of such meeting, except
when such member attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning
of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Such member shall be conclusively presumed to
have assented to any action taken unless his or her dissent shall be entered
in the minutes of the meeting or unless his or her written dissent to such
action shall be filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting
before the adjournment thereof or shall be forwarded by registered mail to the
secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting.
Such right to dissent shall not apply to any member who voted in favor of such
action.

  



  

 _Section 12 Action by Written Consent_. Unless otherwise restricted by
the corporation's certificate of incorporation, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any
committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board
or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic
transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or
transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board, or
committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in
paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in
electronic form.

such person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter, a "proceeding"), in which such director or officer was or is

the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation,
or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or member of any other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, organization or other enterprise. The corporation shall not

venture, trust, organization or other enterprise.

  



  

 _Section 5 Insurance_. The board of directors may, to the full extent
permitted by applicable law as it presently exists, or may hereafter be

purchase and maintain at the corporation's expense insurance: (i) to
indemnify the corporation for any obligation which it incurs as a result of
the indemnification of directors, officers, and employees under the provisions
of this Article V; and (ii) to indemnify or insure directors, officers and
employees against liability in instances in which they may not otherwise be
indemnified by the corporation under the provisions of this Article V.

  



  

 _Section 6 Amendment or Repeal_. Any repeal or modification of the
foregoing provisions of this Article V shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

  



  

 _Section 7 Merger or Consolidation_. For purposes of this Article V,
references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article
V with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would
have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence
had continued.

  



  

ARTICLE VI 
  _CERTIFICATES OF STOCK_

  



  

 _Section 1 No Certificates_. Unless otherwise determined by the board of
directors, the shares of the corporation\'s capital stock shall not be
certificated. If the board determines to certificate the shares of the
corporation\'s capital stock, the following provisions shall apply:

  



  

6.1.1 _Form_. Every holder of stock in the corporation shall be entitled
to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the
president or a vice-president and the secretary or an assistant secretary of
the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the
corporation. If such a certificate is countersigned (1) by a transfer agent or
an assistant transfer agent other than the corporation or its employee or (2)
by a registrar, other than the corporation or its employee, the signature of
any such president, vice-president, secretary, or assistant secretary may be
facsimiles. In case any officer or officers who have signed, or whose
facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any such certificate or
certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation
whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such certificate or
certificates have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate or
certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or
persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile
signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be such
officer or officers of the corporation. All certificates for shares shall be
consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name of the person to whom
the shares represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date
of issue, shall be entered on the books of the corporation. Shares of stock of
the corporation shall only be transferred on the books of the corporation by
the holder of record thereof or by such holder\'s attorney duly authorized in
writing, upon surrender to the corporation of the certificate or certificates
for such shares endorsed by the appropriate person or persons, with such
evidence of the authenticity of such endorsement, transfer, authorization, and
other matters as the corporation may reasonably require, and accompanied by
all necessary stock transfer stamps. In that event, it shall be the duty of
the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto,
cancel the old certificate or certificates, and record the transaction on its
books. The board of directors may appoint a bank or trust company organized
under the laws of the United States or any state thereof to act as its
transfer agent or registrar, or both in connection with the transfer of any
class or series of securities of the corporation.

  



  

   

  



  

6.1.2 _ Lost Certificates_. The board of directors may direct a new
certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or
certificates previously issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed.
When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the board of
directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or
certificates, or his or her legal representative, to give the corporation a
bond sufficient to indemnify the corporation against any claim that may be
made against the corporation on account of the loss, theft or destruction of
any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

  



  

 _Section 2 Fixing a Record Date for Stockholder Meetings_. In order that
the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to
vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the board of
directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of
directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than
ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the
board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of
business on the next day preceding the day on which notice is given, or if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided that the board of directors may fix a
new record date for the adjourned meeting.

  



  

 _Section 3 Fixing a Record Date for Action by Written Consent_. In order
that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and
which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. If no
record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required
by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation
by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of
the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.
Delivery made to the corporation\'s registered office shall be by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has
been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of
directors is required by statute, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be
at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the
resolution taking such prior action.

  



  

   

  



  

 _Section 4 Fixing a Record Date for Other Purposes_. In order that the
corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any
dividend or other distribution or allotment or any rights or the stockholders
entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or
exchange of stock, or for the purposes of any other lawful action, the board
of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which
record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such action. If no
record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board
of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

 _Section 5 Registered Stockholders_. Prior to the surrender to the
corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of stock
with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the corporation
may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to
vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and
powers of an owner. The corporation shall not be bound to recognize any
equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of
any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
thereof.

  



  

 _Section 6 Subscriptions for Stock_. Unless otherwise provided for in
the subscription agreement, subscriptions for shares shall be paid in full at
such time, or in such installments and at such times, as shall be determined
by the board of directors. Any call made by the board of directors for payment
on subscriptions shall be uniform as to all shares of the same class or as to
all shares of the same series. In case of default in the payment of any
installment or call when such payment is due, the corporation may proceed to
collect the amount due in the same manner as any debt due the corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE VII 
  _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

  



  

 _Section 1 Dividends_. Dividends upon the capital stock of the
corporation, subject to the provisions of the corporation's certificate of
incorporation, if any, may be declared by the board of directors at any
regular or special meeting, pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in
property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the
corporation's certificate of incorporation. Before payment of any dividend,
there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for
dividends such sum or sums as the directors from time to time, in their
absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet
contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining
any property of the corporation, or any other purpose and the directors may
modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.

  



  

 _Section 2 Checks, Drafts or Orders_. All checks, drafts, or other
orders for the payment of money by or to the corporation and all notes and
other evidences of indebtedness issued in the name of the corporation shall be
signed by such officer or officers, agent or agents of the corporation, and in
such manner, as shall be determined by resolution of the board of directors or
a duly authorized committee thereof.

  



  

 _Section 3 Contracts_. The board of directors may authorize any officer
or officers, or any agent or agents, of the corporation to enter into any
contract or to execute and deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf
of the corporation, and such authority may be general or confined to specific
instances.

  



  

 _Section 4 Loans_. The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any
obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the
corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a
director of the corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of
the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to
benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or
without interest, and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the board
of directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares
of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this section contained shall be deemed
to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the
corporation at common law or under any statute.

  



  

   

  



  

 _Section 5 Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the corporation shall be
fixed by resolution of the board of directors.

  



  

 _Section 6 Corporate Seal_. The board of directors may provide a
corporate seal, which, if provided, shall be in the form of a circle and shall
have inscribed thereon the name of the corporation and the words "Corporate
Seal, Delaware". The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to
be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.

  



  

 _Section 7 Voting Securities Owned By Corporation_. Voting securities in
any other corporation or other entity (such as a limited liability company,
limited partnership or trust) held by the corporation shall be voted as
directed by the board of directors, unless the board of directors specifically
confers authority to vote with respect thereto, which authority may be general
or confined to specific instances, upon some other person or officer. Any
person authorized to vote securities shall have the power to appoint proxies,
with general power of substitution.

  



  

 _Section 8 Inspection of Books and Records_. Any stockholder of record,
in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath
stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for
business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation\'s stock ledger, a
list of its stockholders, and its other books and records, and to make copies
or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean any purpose reasonably
related to such person\'s interest as a stockholder. In every instance where
an attorney or other agent shall be the person who seeks the right to
inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney
or such other writing which authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act
on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the
corporation at its registered office in the State of Delaware or at its
principal place of business.

  



  

 _Section 9 Exclusive Jurisdiction_. The Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative
action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation, (ii) any action
asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or
officer of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation's
stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the corporation
arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware or the corporation's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or
(iv) any action asserting a claim against the corporation governed by the
internal affairs doctrine.

  



  

 _Section 10 Section Headings_. Section headings in these by-laws are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect in
limiting or otherwise construing any provision herein.

  



  

 _Section 11 Inconsistent Provisions_. In the event that any provision of
these by-laws is or becomes inconsistent with any provision of the
corporation's certificate of incorporation, the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware or any other applicable law, the provision of these by-laws
shall not be given any effect to the extent of such inconsistency but shall
otherwise be given full force and effect.

  



  

   

  



  

ARTICLE VIII 
  _AMENDMENTS_

  



  

These by-laws may be amended, altered, or repealed and new by-laws adopted at
any meeting of the board of directors by a majority vote. The fact that the
power to adopt, amend, alter, or repeal the by-laws has been conferred upon
the board of directors shall not divest the stockholders of the same powers.
