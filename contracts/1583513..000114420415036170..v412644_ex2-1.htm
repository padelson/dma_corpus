Fund Waiver</U>. Reference is made to the final prospectus of the Buyer dated October 24, 2013 (File No. 333-191195) (the &ldquo;<U>Prospectus</U>&rdquo;).
Each of the Seller Parties warrants and represents, jointly and severally, that such Seller Party has read the Prospectus and understands
that the Buyer has established the Trust Fund containing the proceeds of the IPO initially in the amount of at least Seventy-Two
Million Seven Hundred Ninety-Five Thousand Dollars ($72,795,000) for the benefit of the Buyer&rsquo;s public stockholders and certain
other parties (including the underwriters of the IPO) and that the Buyer may disburse monies from the Trust Fund, including any
proceeds therefrom, only as provided in the Prospectus. For and in consideration of the Buyer agreeing to enter into this Agreement,
each of the Seller Parties agrees that, notwithstanding any provisions contained in this Agreement, such Seller Party does not
now have, and shall not at any time prior to the Closing have, any claim to, or make any claim against, the Trust Fund, any asset
contained therein or any Additional Person, regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating
in any way to, the business relationship between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the
other hand, this Agreement or any other agreement or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract,
tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability. Each of the Seller Parties (for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and
direct and indirect subsidiaries and stockholders, and its and their respective successors and assigns, and any Person claiming
by or through such Seller Party) hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights, titles, interests and claims of any kind that such
Seller Party may have, now or in the future (in each case, however, prior to the consummation of a business combination), and shall
not take any action or suit, make any claim or demand or seek recovery of any Liability or recourse against, the Trust Fund or
any Additional Person for any reason whatsoever in respect thereof. Each of the Seller Parties agrees and acknowledges that such
irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by the Buyer to induce it to enter into this Agreement.
Each of the Seller Parties further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable under applicable Law.
To the extent that any of the Seller Parties or the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative commences any action or Proceeding based
upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the Buyer or any Additional Person, which Proceeding
seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against the Buyer or any Additional Person, each of the Seller Parties hereby acknowledges
and agrees that such Seller Party&rsquo;s sole remedy shall be against the Buyer&rsquo;s funds held outside of the Trust Fund and
that such claim shall not permit such Seller Party (or any party claiming on such Seller Party&rsquo;s behalf or in lieu of such
Seller Party) to have any claim against any Additional Person or the Trust Fund or any amounts contained therein. In the event
that any of the Seller Parties or the Stockholders&rsquo; Representative commences any action or Proceeding based upon, in connection
