AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION is entered into as of January

a California corporation ("Parent"), Major League Merger Corporation, a
Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub
1"), Minor League Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub 2"), and August Technology
Corporation, a Minnesota corporation (the "Company").   WHEREAS, the
respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and the
Company have each approved, and deemed it to be advisable and in the best
interests of their respective shareholders to consummate the business
combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which (i) Parent
will merge with and into Merger Sub 2 (the "Migratory Merger") in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and the California
Corporations Code ("CCC") and (ii) following the Migratory Merger, Merger Sub
1 will merge with and into the Company (the "Acquisition Merger")
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the Minnesota Business Corporations Act
("MBCA");   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and
as an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders
of the Company are entering into voting agreements with Parent, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each, a "Company
Shareholder Voting Agreement" and collectively, the "Company Shareholder
Voting Agreements"), pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed, among
other things, to vote their shares of Company Common Stock (as defined below)
in favor of the Acquisition Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement
and as an inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, certain
shareholders of Parent have agreed to enter into voting agreements with the
Company, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (each, a
"Parent Shareholder Voting Agreement" and collectively, the "Parent
Shareholder Voting Agreements"), pursuant to which such shareholders have
agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of Parent Common Stock (as
defined below) in favor of the Migratory Merger and the Acquisition Merger
(collectively, the "Mergers") and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and   WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it
is intended that the Mergers shall each qualify as reorganizations within the
meaning of      Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement shall be, and is hereby,
adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Section 368(a) of the

applicable to the Migratory Merger by a governmental authority of competent

on a date to be specified by Parent and the Company which shall be no later
than the second (2nd) business day after satisfaction or waiver of each of
the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII or on such other date and such other
time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree. The date on which the
Closing shall occur is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date".  
Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the
Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as
Exchange Agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"). As soon as practicable after
the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, Nanometrics Delaware shall deposit
with or for the account of the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock, stock certificates representing the shares of
Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock and an amount of cash sufficient to deliver
to the holders of Company Common Stock any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 3.2(c) and any dividends or other distributions
to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(c) (such
certificates for shares of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock together with
cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or other distributions being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") deliverable pursuant to
Section 2.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.  
(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Acquisition Merger
Effective Time, Nanometrics Delaware shall instruct the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
that were converted pursuant to Section 2.6(a) into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Nanometrics
Delaware may reasonably specify that are not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the cash amount in
lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.2(d) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.2(e). Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and    7     such other customary
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive (A) certificates evidencing the
Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.6(a) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
evidenced by such Certificate, (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 3.2(d), and (C) any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(d), after giving effect to any tax
withholdings required by applicable Law, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company as of the Acquisition Merger Effective Time,
a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Nanometrics
Delaware Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
evidencing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate that, prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, represented
shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed, from and after the Acquisition
Merger Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to represent only the
right to receive upon surrender the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock payable
pursuant to Section 3.2(d), in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.   (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. At
the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to such time. If, after such time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 3.2(b).   (d) No
Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of
Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
Nanometrics Delaware. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the
Acquisition Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive
a fraction of a share of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock (after taking
into account all Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby) shall receive,
in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock multiplied by
the last reported sales price of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock at the end
of regular trading hours on the NASDAQ Nanometrics Market (the "NASDAQ") on
the Closing Date (the "Nanometrics Delaware Closing Price").   
8      (e) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Acquisition
Merger Effective Time with respect to Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock with
a record date after the Acquisition Merger Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 3.2(d), unless and until the holder of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, in addition to
the Merger Consideration deliverable therefore pursuant to Section 2.6,
without interest, (A) the amount of any cash payable with respect to a
fractional share of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(d) and (B) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the
Acquisition Merger Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares
of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock.   (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Certificates. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, such shares of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock as may
be required pursuant to Section 2.6(a) as well as the other Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 3.2(f) and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
3.2(e); provided, however, that Nanometrics Delaware may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement
of indemnification in form satisfactory to Nanometrics Delaware, or a bond in
such sum as Nanometrics Delaware may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Nanometrics Delaware or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   (g) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares
of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than
that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered,
it will be a condition to the issuance thereof that the Certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to
Nanometrics Delaware or any    9     agent designated by it any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for shares of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock in any name other than that
of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or will have
established to the satisfaction of Nanometrics Delaware or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (h)
Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time following the six (6) month
anniversary of the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, Nanometrics Delaware
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Nanometrics
Delaware any portion of the Exchange Fund not disbursed to holders of
Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only
to Nanometrics Delaware (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Law) with respect to the Merger Consideration to which such holders
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(a), any cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable to such holders pursuant to Section 3.2(d) and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section
3.2(e), upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest
thereon.   (i) No Liability. Neither Nanometrics Delaware, Parent,
Merger Sub 1, nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Law following the passage of time specified therein.   (j)
Withholding Rights. Nanometrics Delaware, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person
who was a holder of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock immediately
prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time such amounts as Nanometrics
Delaware, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Nanometrics Delaware, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Nanometrics Delaware, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

a complete and accurate list of, and true and complete copies have been
delivered or made available to Parent with respect to, all Company Material

or violation of or default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
any of the Company Material Contracts, except such breaches, violations and
defaults as have been waived in writing, and (ii) no event has occurred with

Material Contracts, which breach, violation or default referred to in clauses
(i) or (ii) would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.13 Employee
Benefit Plans, Options and Employment Agreements.   (a) Section 4.13(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of
all Employee Benefit Plans maintained, or contributed to by the Company or
any of its ERISA Affiliates or to which the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates is obligated to contribute, or under which any of them has or may
have any liability for premiums or benefits (collectively, the "Company
Employee Plans").   (b) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the
Company has made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of (i) such
Company Employee Plan (or a written summary of any unwritten plan) together
with all amendments, (ii) in the case of any plan for which Forms 5500 are
required to be filed, the most recent annual report (Form 5500) with
schedules attached, (iii) in the case of any plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service, (iv) each trust agreement, group
annuity contract, administration and similar material agreements, investment
management or investment advisory agreements, (v) the most recent summary
plan descriptions and employee handbook,    20     or other similar
material employee communications relating to employee benefits matters, (vi)
all personnel, payroll and employment manuals and policies, and (vii) the
most recent financial statements for each Company Employee Plan that is
funded.   (c) Each Company Employee Plan has been administered in
all material respects in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other
applicable Laws and the regulations thereunder and materially in accordance
with its terms and each of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates have in all
material respects met their obligations with respect to each Company Employee
Plan and have timely made (or timely will make) all required contributions
thereto. All filings and reports as to each Company Employee Plan required to
have been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service or to the United States
Department of Labor have been timely submitted. With respect to the Company
Employee Plans, no event has occurred, and, to the Company\'s knowledge,
there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which
the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any plan
participant could be subject to any material liability (including penalties
or taxes) under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law, nor will the
negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement give rise to any such material liability.   (d) With respect to
the Company Employee Plans, there are no material benefit obligations for
which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are no
benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or
otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with the requirements of GAAP, on
the financial statements of the Company. The assets of each Company Employee
Plan which is funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and
records of such Employee Benefit Plan.   (e) No Company Employee Plan (other
than the Company Stock Plans) has assets that include securities issued by
the Company or any its ERISA Affiliates.   (f) All the Company Employee
Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(each, a "Qualified Plan") have received determination, opinion or advisory
letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company
Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and trusts related thereto are
exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, or the Company has remaining a period of time
under applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations or Internal
Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for such a letter and to
make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to the
qualified status of each such Qualified Plan. To the Company\'s knowledge, no
such determination, opinion or advisory letter has been revoked and
revocation has not been threatened, and no such Employee Benefit Plan has
been amended or operated since the date of its most recent   
21     determination letter or application therefor in any respect, and
no act or omission has occurred, that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its cost. There has
been no termination, partial termination or discontinuance of contributions
to any Qualified Plan that will result in material liability to the Company.
Each Company Employee Plan which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or
Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for compliance with, and
satisfies in all material respects the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and
Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for each plan year ending
prior to the Closing Date for which testing is required to be completed.  
(g) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever
maintained a Company Employee Plan which was ever subject to Section 412
of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been obligated to contribute to
a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No
Company Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a
"voluntary employees\' beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code.   (h) To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
each Company Employee Plan (other than the Company Stock Plans or an
employment, severance, change in control or similar agreement with an
individual) is amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company or
covered thereby at any time without material liability to the Company as a
result thereof, other than for benefits accrued as of the date of such
amendment or termination and routine administrative costs.   (i) Other than
as required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, none of the Company Employee
Plans promises or provides health or other welfare benefits (excluding normal
claims for benefits under the Company\'s group life insurance, accidental
death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans and policies) or
coverage to any person following retirement or other termination
of employment. Section 4.13(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
each Company Employee Plan which provides benefits after termination of
employment (other than medical benefits required to be continued under
Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA) and
normal claims for benefits under the Company\'s group life insurance,
accidental death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans and
policies) and the present value of benefits accrued under each such Company
Employee Plan are fully funded, fully covered by insurance or reflected on
the Company Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP.   (j) There is no
action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or investigation pending
or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened, with respect to any Company
Employee Plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course. No
Company Employee Plan is or within the last three calendar years has been the
subject of, or has received notice that it is the subject of, examination by
a government agency or a participant in a government sponsored amnesty,
voluntary compliance or similar program.    22      (k) To the
Company\'s knowledge, each individual who has received compensation for the
performance of services on behalf of the Company, any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has been properly
classified as an employee or independent contractor in accordance
with applicable Law.   (l) Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
with respect to each Company Employee Plan maintained or covering employees
outside the United States, and the books and records thereof: (i) such plan
is in material compliance with all applicable Laws of each applicable
jurisdiction and; (ii) there is no action, suit, proceeding, claim,
arbitration, audit or investigation pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge,
threatened, with respect to such plan, other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course; (iii) all liabilities with respect to such plan are set
forth on a consolidated balance sheet of Company or in the notes thereto in
accordance with GAAP; and (iv) no such plan is or within the last two
calendar years has been the subject of, or has received notice that it is the
subject of, an examination by a government agency or a participant in a
government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program that
has given rise to or is reasonably expected to give rise to any liability.
Section 4.13(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each country in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates has operations and
the number of employees in each such country.   (m) Section 4.13(m) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct list of:
(i) all employment agreements with employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than at-will offer letters that are consistent with the
Company\'s general form and do not provide for severance payments or
benefits, notice periods for termination or change of control benefits); (ii)
all employees or former employees of the Company who have executed a non
competition agreement with the Company; (iii) all severance agreements,
programs and policies of the Company with or relating to its employees,
excluding programs and policies required to be maintained by Law; and (iv)
all plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of the
Company pursuant to which payments (or acceleration of benefits or vesting of
options or lapse of repurchase rights) may be required, or may become payable
directly or indirectly as a result of or in connection with, the negotiation
or consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the execution of,
this Agreement. True, complete and correct copies of each of the foregoing
agreements to which any employee of the Company is a party have been made
available to Parent.   (n) All contributions required to be made with
respect to any Company Employee Plan on or prior to the Acquisition Merger
Effective Time have been or will be timely made or are reflected on the
Company Balance Sheet. There    23     are no pending, threatened or
reasonably anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Plan, by any employee or
beneficiary covered under any such Company Employee Plan, or otherwise
involving any such Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).   (o) The
negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i)
entitle any current or former employee or officer of the Company to severance
pay, or any other payment from the Company or (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, cause a lapse of repurchase rights or increase the amount
of compensation due any such employee or officer. There is no Company
Employee Plan or other contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G (determined
without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) as a result of the Mergers
or 162(m) of the Code.   Section 4.14 Labor Matters.   (a) The Company is

There are no actions, suits, claims, grievances, investigations, or other
proceedings pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened, between (i)
the Company (and/or any of their current or former officers, directors,
employees, or representatives, in their capacities as such) and (ii) any of
their respective current or former employees, consultants or independent
contractors, or any applicant for employment or classes of the foregoing, or
any Governmental Entity, which actions, suits, claims,
grievances, investigations, or other proceedings have or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (d) The Company has good labor relations, and the Company
and its employees, agents or representatives have not committed any unfair
labor practice as defined in the National Labor Relations Act. The Company is
not a party to, bound by or subject to (and none of the Company\'s properties
or assets is bound by or subject to) any labor agreement, collective
bargaining agreement,    24     work rules or practices, or any other
labor-related agreements or arrangements with any labor union, labor
organization, trade union or works council. There are no labor agreements,
collective bargaining agreements, work rules or practices, or any other
labor-related agreements or arrangements that pertain to any of the employees
of the Company, and no employees of the Company are represented by any labor
union, labor organization, trade union or works council with respect to their
employment with the Company.   (e) To the Company\'s knowledge, there are no

council, or group of employees of the Company has made a pending demand for
recognition or certification, and there are no representation or
certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding
presently pending or threatened in writing to be brought or filed with the

the Company.   (f) No employee of the Company (i) to the Company\'s
knowledge, is in violation of any term of any patent disclosure agreement,
non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer
relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by the Company
because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be
conducted by the Company or relating to the use of trade secrets or
proprietary information of others, or (ii) in the case of any key employee or
group of key employees, has given notice as of the date of this Agreement to
the Company that such employee or any employee in a group of key employees
intends to terminate his or her employment with the Company.   (g) The
Company is and has been in compliance with all notice and other requirements
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as
amended (the "WARN Act"), and any similar foreign, state or local Law
relating to plant closings and layoffs. The Company is not currently
engaged in any layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in number to
trigger application of the WARN Act or any similar state, local or foreign
Law. Section 4.14(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list of the names and the sites of employment or facilities of those
individuals who suffered an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) at
any site of employment or facility of the Company during the 90-day period

Disclosure Schedule shall be updated immediately prior to the Closing with
respect to the 90-day period prior to the Closing.    25      (h) The

Company has good and valid title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all

the Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice). All properties and assets reflected in the Company Balance
Sheet are free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens reflected on the
Company Balance Sheet and Liens for current taxes not yet due and other Liens
that do not materially impair the use or operation of the property or assets
subject thereto.   (b) Section 4.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true, complete and correct list of all real property owned, leased,
subleased or licensed by the Company and the location of such premises. All

Leases") are either filed as exhibits to the Company SEC Reports or complete

Taxes.   (a) The Company has filed with the appropriate taxing

paid. There are no Liens relating or attributable or Taxes on any assets of
the Company, other than liens relating to Taxes not yet due and payable. The
Company has not granted any outstanding waiver of any statute of limitations
with respect to, or any outstanding extension of a period for the assessment
of, any Tax. The accruals and reserves for Taxes (exclusive of any accruals

tax and financial accounting principles) reflected in the Company Balance
Sheet are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable through the date thereof
(including Taxes being contested) in accordance with GAAP. All liabilities
for Taxes attributable to the period commencing on the date following the
date of the Company Balance Sheet were incurred in the ordinary course of
business and are consistent in type and amount with Taxes attributable to

"reportable transaction," as set forth in Treas. Reg. ss. 1.6011-4(b).

proceedings investigations, inquiries or subpoenas referred to in clause (a)
and (b) above would reasonably be expected    40     to have a Parent

41      (vi) includes indemnification, guaranty or warranty other than

are required to be described in the Parent SEC Reports (or to be filed as
exhibits thereto) are so described or filed and are enforceable and in full
force and effect (except as such enforceability may be subject to Laws of
general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, and the relief of
debtors and rules of Law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or
other equitable remedies).   (c) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) there
is no breach or violation of or default by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
under any of the Parent Material Contracts, except such breaches, violations
and defaults as have been waived, and (ii) no event has occurred with respect
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a breach, violation or default, or give rise to a
right of termination, modification, cancellation, foreclosure, imposition of
a Lien, prepayment or acceleration under any of the Parent Material
Contracts, which breach, violation or default referred to in clauses (i) or
(ii), would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (d) Section 5.12 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of, and true and
complete copies have been delivered or made available to the Company with
respect to, all Parent Material Contracts in effect as of the date hereof
other than the Parent Material Contracts which are listed as an exhibit to
Parent\'s most recent annual report on Form 10-K or a subsequent quarterly
report on Form 10-Q or as otherwise set forth on Section 5.12(a) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule.   Section 5.13 Employee Benefit Plans, Options
and Employment Agreements.   (a) Section 5.13(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all Employee Benefit
Plans maintained, or contributed to by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates or to which Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates is obligated to
contribute, or under which any of them has or may have any liability for
premiums or benefits for the benefit of employees located in the United
States (collectively, the "Parent Employee Plans").    42      (b)
With respect to each Parent Employee Plan, Parent has made available to the
Company complete and accurate copies of (i) such Parent Employee Plan (or a
written summary of any unwritten plan) together with all amendments, (ii) in
the case of any plan for which Forms 5500 are required to be filed, the most
recent annual report (Form 5500) with schedules attached, (iii) in the case
of any plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service,
(iv) each trust agreement, group annuity contract, administration and similar
material agreements, investment management or investment advisory agreements,
(v) the most recent summary plan descriptions and employee handbook, or other
similar material employee communications relating to employee
benefits matters, (vi) all personnel, payroll and employment manuals and
policies, and (vii) the most recent financial statements for each Parent
Employee Plan that is funded.   (c) Each Parent Employee Plan has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with ERISA, the Code and
all other applicable Laws and the regulations thereunder and materially in
accordance with its terms and each of Parent, its Subsidiaries and their
respective ERISA Affiliates have in all material respects met their
obligations with respect to each Parent Employee Plan and have timely made
(or timely will make) all required contributions thereto. All filings and
reports as to each Parent Employee Plan required to have been submitted to
the Internal Revenue Service or to the United States Department of Labor have
been timely submitted. With respect to the Parent Employee Plans, no event
has occurred, and, to Parent\'s knowledge, there exists no condition or set
of circumstances in connection with which Parent, its Subsidiaries or any
plan participant could be subject to any material liability (including
penalties or taxes) under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law, nor
will the negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement give rise to any such material liability.   (d) With respect to
the Parent Employee Plans, there are no material benefit obligations for
which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are no
benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or
otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with the requirements of GAAP, on
the financial statements of Parent. The assets of each Parent Employee Plan
which is funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and
records of such Parent Employee Plan.   (e) No Parent Employee Plan has
assets that include securities issued by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates.    43      (f) All the
Parent Employee Plans that are Qualified Plans have received determination,
opinion or advisory letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect
that such Parent Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and trusts
related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a)
and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or Parent has remaining a period of
time under applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations or Internal
Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for such a letter and to
make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to
the qualified status of each such Qualified Plan. To Parent\'s knowledge, no
such determination, opinion or advisory letter has been revoked and
revocation has not been threatened, and no such Parent Employee Plan has been
amended or operated since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred,
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its cost. There has been no termination, partial
termination or discontinuance of contributions to any Qualified Plan that
will result in material liability to Parent. Each Parent Employee Plan which
is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has
been tested for compliance with, and satisfies in all material respects the
requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the
case may be, for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date for which
testing is required to be completed.   (g) Neither Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever
maintained a Parent Employee Plan which was ever subject to Section 412 of
the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been obligated to contribute to a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) that is
subject to ERISA. No Parent Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or
related to a "voluntary employees\' beneficiary association" within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.   (h) To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, each Parent Employee Plan (other than the Parent Stock Plans
or an employment, severance, change in control or similar agreement with an
individual) is amendable and terminable unilaterally by Parent or one or more
of its Subsidiaries party thereto or covered thereby at any time without
material liability to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof,
other than for benefits accrued as of the date of such amendment or
termination and routine administrative costs.   (i) Other than as required
under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, none of the Parent Employee Plans
promises or provides health or other welfare benefits (excluding normal
claims for benefits under the Parent\'s group life insurance, accidental
death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans and policies) or
coverage to any person following retirement or other termination
of employment. Section 5.13(i) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists each
Parent Employee Plan which provides benefits after termination of employment
(other than medical benefits required to be continued under Section 4980B of
the Code    44     and part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA) and
normal claims for benefits under the Parent\'s group life insurance,
accidental death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans and
policies) and the present value of benefits accrued under each such Parent
Employee Plan are fully funded, fully covered by insurance or reflected on
the Parent Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP.   (j) There is no action,
suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or investigation pending or, to
Parent\'s knowledge, threatened, with respect to any Parent Employee Plan,
other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course. No Parent Employee
Plan is or within the last two calendar years has been the subject of, or has
received notice that it is the subject of, examination by a government agency
or a participant in a government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or
similar program.   (k) To Parent\'s knowledge, each individual who has
received compensation for the performance of services on behalf of Parent,
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates has been
properly classified as an employee or independent contractor in accordance
with applicable Law.   (l) Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates that covers employees outside
the United States, and the books and records thereof, (i) such plan is in
compliance with all applicable Laws of each applicable jurisdiction; (ii)
there is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or
investigation pending or, to Parent\'s knowledge, threatened, with respect to
such plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course; (iii) all
liabilities with respect to such plan are set forth on a consolidated balance
sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto in accordance
with GAAP; and (iv) no such plan is or within the last two calendar years has
been the subject of, or has received notice that it is the subject of, an
examination by a government agency or a participant in a government sponsored
amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program that has given rise to or is
reasonably expected to give rise to any liability. Section 5.13(l) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule lists each country in which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates has operations and the number of employees in each
such country.   (m) Section 5.13(m) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true, complete and correct list of: (i) all employment agreements
with employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than at-will offer
letters that are consistent with Parent\'s general form and do not provide
for severance payments or benefits, notice periods for termination or change
of control benefits); (ii) all employees or former employees of Parent who
have executed a non competition agreement with Parent; (iii) all severance
agreements, programs and policies of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with
or relating to its employees, excluding programs and policies required to be
maintained by Law; and    45     (iv) all plans, programs, agreements
and other arrangements of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which
payments (or acceleration of benefits or vesting of options or lapse of
repurchase rights) may be required upon, or may become payable directly or
indirectly as a result of or in connection with, the negotiation or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the execution of, this
Agreement. True, complete and correct copies of each of the foregoing
agreements to which any employee of Parent is a party have been
made available to Company.   (n) All contributions required to be made with
respect to any Parent Employee Plan on or prior to the Acquisition Merger
Effective Time have been or will be timely made or are reflected on the
Parent Balance Sheet. There are no pending, threatened or reasonably
anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Plan, by any employee or
beneficiary covered under any such Parent Employee Plan, or otherwise
involving any such Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).   (o) The
negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i)
entitle any current or former employee or officer of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance pay, or any other payment from Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, cause a lapse
of repurchase rights or increase the amount of compensation due any
such employee or officer. There is no Parent Employee Plan or other
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to Sections 280G (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of
the Code) as a result of the Mergers or 162(m) of the Code.   Section 5.14

all applicable Laws respecting employment and employment practices,
including, without limitation, all Laws respecting terms and conditions of
employment, health and safety, wages and hours, child labor, immigration,

plant closures and layoffs, affirmative action, workers\' compensation, labor
relations, employee leave issues and unemployment insurance.   (b) There
are no personnel manuals or handbooks applicable to employees of Parent,
other than those set forth in Section 5.14(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, true and complete copies or written summaries of which
have heretofore been provided to the Company.   (c) There are no actions,
suits, claims, grievances, investigations, or other proceedings pending or,
to Parent\'s knowledge, threatened, between (i) Parent (and/or any of their
current or former officers,    46     directors, employees, or
representatives, in their capacities as such) and (ii) any of their
respective current or former employees, consultants or
independent contractors, or any applicant for employment or classes of the
foregoing, or any Governmental Entity, which actions, suits, claims,
grievances, investigations, or other proceedings have or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   (d) Parent has good labor relations, and Parent and
its employees, agents or representatives have not committed any unfair
labor practice as defined in the National Labor Relations Act. Parent is not
a party to, bound by or subject to (and none of Parent\'s properties or
assets is bound by or subject to) any labor agreement, collective bargaining
agreement, work rules or practices, or any other labor-related agreements or
arrangements with any labor union, labor organization, trade union or works
council. There are no labor agreements, collective bargaining agreements,
work rules or practices, or any other labor-related agreements or
arrangements that pertain to any of the employees of Parent, and no employees
of Parent are represented by any labor union, labor organization, trade union
or works council with respect to their employment with Parent.   (e) To
Parent\'s knowledge, there are no current labor union organizing activities
with respect to any employees of Parent, and no labor union, labor
organization, trade union, works council, or group of employees of Parent has
made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and there are no
representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking
a representation proceeding presently pending or threatened in writing to
be brought or filed with the National Labor Relations Board or any other
labor relations tribunal or authority. To the Parent\'s knowledge, there are
no labor disputes, strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, or threats
thereof, against or affecting Parent.   (f) No employee of Parent (i) to
Parent\'s knowledge, is in violation of any term of any patent disclosure
agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former
employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by Parent
because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be
conducted by Parent or relating to the use of trade secrets or proprietary
information of others, or (ii) in the case of any key employee or group of
key employees, has given notice as of the date of this Agreement to Parent
that such employee or any employee in a group of key employees intends to
terminate his or her employment with Parent.   (g) Parent is and has been in
compliance with all notice and other requirements under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (the "WARN Act"), and any
similar foreign, state or local Law relating to plant closings and layoffs.
Parent is not currently engaged in    47     any layoffs or employment
terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of the WARN Act or
any similar state, local or foreign Law. Section 5.14(g) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of the names and the
sites of employment or facilities of those individuals who suffered an
"employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) at any site of employment or
facility of Parent during the 90-day period prior to the date of this
Agreement. Section 5.14(g) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be updated
immediately prior to the Closing with respect to the 90-day period prior to
the Closing.   (h) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of

Parent Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice). All properties and assets reflected in the Parent Balance Sheet
are free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens reflected on the Parent
Balance Sheet and Liens for current taxes not yet due and other Liens that do
not materially impair the use or operation of the property or assets subject
thereto.   (b) Section 5.15 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true, complete and correct list of all real property owned, leased,
subleased or licensed by Parent and the location of such premises. All

specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies), (ii)
there is no existing material default by Parent under any of the Parent Real

no event has occurred with respect to Parent which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default of any of the Parent Real Property

Taxes on any assets of Parent other than Liens relating to Taxes not yet due
and payable. Parent has not granted any outstanding waiver of any statute of
limitations with respect to, or any outstanding extension of a period for the
assessment of, any Tax. The accruals and reserves for Taxes (exclusive of any
accruals for "deferred taxes" or similar items that reflect
timing differences between tax and financial accounting principles) reflected
in the Parent Balance Sheet are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable through
the date thereof (including Taxes being contested) in accordance with GAAP.
All liabilities for Taxes attributable to the period commencing on the
date following the date of the Parent Balance Sheet were incurred in the
ordinary course of business and are consistent in type and amount with Taxes

Section 1504 of the Code. Except with respect to the group referred to in the

Code) during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of
the Code.   (g) Parent has not constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning

qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (A) in the two
years prior to the date of this Agreement or (B) in a distribution which
could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
connection with the Acquisition Merger.   (h) Parent has not engaged in, or
has any commitment to engage in, any transaction that is the same as or

"reportable transaction," as set forth in Treas. Reg. ss. 1.6011-4(b).

material respects with federal, state, local and foreign Laws and regulations
relating to Materials of Environmental Concern, or otherwise relating to

Parent has not received any written notice, whether from a governmental

or penalties relating to (i) the presence, or release into the environment,

circumstances that could reasonably be expected to form the basis of any
Parent Environmental Claim against Parent or against any person or entity
whose liability for any Parent Environmental Claim Parent has retained or
assumed either contractually or by operation of Law, except where such Parent
Environmental Claim, if made, would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
or otherwise require disclosure in the Parent SEC Reports. Parent has made
available to the Company all material third party, non privileged

violation of any material license, sublicense, agreement or instrument to
which Parent is party or otherwise bound under which Parent derives rights to

competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 7.6
as outside "counsel only" and, in such event, such material and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by such counsel to non-
legal directors, officers, employees or other advisors or representatives of
the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials or its legal counsel.    65    (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 7.6 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates shall
be required to (i) sell or dispose of or hold separately (through a trust or
otherwise) any assets or businesses or interests in any assets or businesses
of Parent, the Company or their respective affiliates or make any other
change in any portion of the businesses of the Company or Parent or incur any
other limitation on the conduct of the businesses of the Company or Parent to
obtain such clearances, consents, authorizations, orders, approvals and
exemptions or agree to do, or submit to orders providing for, any of
the foregoing, in each case whether before or after the Acquisition Merger
Effective Time, or (ii) if any governmental body that has the authority to
enforce any Antitrust Law seeks, or authorizes its staff to seek, a
preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the
Acquisition Merger, take or agree to take any action which Parent reasonably
believes would be prohibited or restricted under such preliminary injunction
or restraining order.   (d) In case at any time after the Acquisition Merger
Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the Acquisition Merger, the proper officers and directors of
each party hereto shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Nanometrics Delaware to achieve such intent.   Section 7.7
Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however, that a
party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press
release or make such public statement as may upon consultation with outside
counsel be required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of the
NASDAQ if it has used all reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
party prior thereto regarding the timing, scope and content of any such press
release or public statement, and provided, further, no such consultation
shall be required to make any disclosure or otherwise take any action
expressly permitted by Section 7.3.    66    Section 7.8 Company
Employee Benefits; Company 401(k) Plan.   (a) From and after the Acquisition
Merger Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, recognize the prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries of each
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Acquisition Merger
Effective Time (the "Company Employees") in connection with all employee
benefit plans, programs or policies (including vacation) of Parent or its
affiliates in which Company Employees are eligible to participate following
the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and levels of vacation and severance benefits (but not for purposes of
benefit accruals or benefit amounts under any defined benefit pension plan or
to the extent that such recognition would result in duplication of
benefits).   (b) Prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, the
Company shall take such actions as Parent may reasonably request so as to
enable the Surviving Corporation to effect such actions relating to the
Company 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") as Parent may deem necessary or
appropriate (after reasonable consultation with the Company), including
terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective
Time.   Section 7.9 Company Stock Plans.   (a) At the Acquisition Merger
Effective Time, Nanometrics Delaware shall assume the rights and obligations
of the Company with respect to the Company Stock Plans as well as the duties
of the Company with respect to the administration of such plans such that
Nanometrics Delaware may operate the Company Stock Plans.   (b) At the
Acquisition Merger Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time,
whether or not then vested or exercisable (each, an "Assumed Option"), shall
be assumed by Nanometrics Delaware. Each such Assumed Option shall continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as are in effect
immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, except that (i)
such Assumed Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares
of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to
the next whole number of shares of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock) of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective
Time and the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the next whole
cent) obtained by    67   dividing the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such Assumed Option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio. It is
the intention of the parties that each Assumed Option that qualified as an
incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall continue
to so qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Acquisition
Merger Effective Time.   (c) If and to the extent necessary or required by
the terms of any of the Company Stock Plans or any Company Stock Option, the
Company shall, prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, (i) obtain any
consents from holders of Company Stock Options and (ii) amend the terms of
its equity incentive plans or arrangements, to give effect to the provisions
of Section 7.9(b). The Company shall take no action, other than those actions
contemplated by this Agreement, that will cause or result in the accelerated
vesting of the Assumed Options.   (d) Except as otherwise requested by
Parent subject to the last sentence of this Section (d), prior to the
Acquisition Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary and
appropriate actions requested by Parent so that all outstanding purchase
rights under the Company ESPP shall automatically be exercised, in accordance
with the terms of the Company ESPP, prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective
Time, and the shares of Company Common Stock purchased under those exercised
rights shall at the Acquisition Merger Effective Time be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive shares of Nanometrics Delaware Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.6(a) of this Agreement. Except as otherwise
requested by Parent subject to the last sentence of this Section (d), prior
to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate actions so that the Company ESPP shall terminate
immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, and no further
purchase rights shall be granted under the Company ESPP. Prior to
the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary
and appropriate actions requested by Parent so that all outstanding purchase
rights under the Company ESPP and the Company ESPP itself shall be treated in
the manner requested by Parent as long as such actions may be taken pursuant
to the Company ESPP.   (e) As soon as practicable following the Acquisition
Merger Effective Time, but in any event within fifteen (15) business days
thereafter (to the extent Parent or Nanometrics Delaware, as appropriate,
have received the most recent copies of the relevant Company Stock Plans),
Nanometrics Delaware shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of Nanometrics Delaware Common
Stock issuable pursuant to the outstanding Assumed Options, Nanometrics
Delaware shall cause the same to become effective, and Parent shall take such
further actions as may be reasonably necessary to cover under such
registration statement shares of Parent Common Stock held by those persons
eligible immediately prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the 1995 Director
Plan.    68    Section 7.10 Indemnification and Insurance.   (a) For
six (6) years after the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, Nanometrics
Delaware shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements
in effect immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its current or former
directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Acquisition Merger
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"). In addition, for a period of six
(6) years following the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, Parent shall (and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that
are at least as favorable as the indemnification and exculpation provisions
contained in the certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws (or
other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, and during such
six-year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any respect, except as required by Law.   (b) For a period of
six (6) years after the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, Nanometrics
Delaware and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect
the existing policy of the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' and
fiduciary liability insurance (the "DandO; Policy") covering claims arising
from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Acquisition
Merger Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to the extent that such acts or omissions are covered by
the DandO; Policy) and covering each Indemnified Party who is covered as of the
Acquisition Merger Effective Time by the DandO; Policy on terms with respect to
coverage and amounts that are no less favorable than those terms in effect on
the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall Nanometrics
Delaware or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year
an amount in excess of 200% of the current annual premium paid by the Company
(which annual premium is set forth on Schedule 6.11(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (such 200% amount, the "Maximum
Annual Premium"); and provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Nanometrics Delaware and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.10 to the contrary, Parent may
fulfill its (and Surviving Corporation\'s) obligations under this
Section 7.10(b) by purchasing a DandO; Policy or a "tail" policy under the
Company\'s existing DandO; Policy, in either case which (i) has an effective
term of six (6) years from the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, (ii) covers
only those persons who are currently covered by the Company\'s directors\'
and officers\' insurance    69   policy in effect as of the date hereof
and only for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Acquisition
Merger Effective Time, (iii) contains terms with respect to coverage and
amounts that are no less favorable than those terms in the Company\'s DandO;
Policy on the date hereof.   (c) The obligations under this Section 7.10
shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO; Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in
paragraph (b) above (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior
written consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO; Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in
paragraph (b) above (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the
Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO;
Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in paragraph (b) above (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this Section 7.10, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The
rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries
under the DandO; Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in paragraph (b) above
(and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 7.10 shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons
may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements
of or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable
Law (whether at Law or in equity).   (d) In the event that Nanometrics
Delaware, Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective successors or assigns) shall consolidate or merge with any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger, or transfers at least 50% of its properties and
assets to any other person, then in each case proper provision shall be made
so that the continuing or surviving corporation or entity (or its successors
or assigns, if applicable), or transferee of such assets, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.   (e) Prior to
or concurrently with the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, Nanometrics
Delaware shall cause to be in effect at the Acquisition Merger Effective Time
a policy of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering claims
arising from facts or events that occur after the Acquisition Merger
Effective Time for not less than $15 million in coverage.   Section 7.11
Company Affiliates. Section 7.11 of the Company Schedule contains a complete
and accurate list of those persons who may be deemed to be, in the Company\'s
reasonable judgment, affiliates of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145
promulgated under the Securities Act (each, a "Company Affiliate" and
collectively, the "Company Affiliates"). The Company shall provide Parent
with such information and documents as Parent reasonably requests   
70   for purposes of reviewing and evaluating the foregoing schedule of
Company Affiliates. Parent will be entitled to place appropriate legends on
the certificates evidencing any Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock to be
issued to a Company Affiliate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to
issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the
Nanometrics Delaware Common Stock.   Section 7.12 Tax Matters. None of
Nanometrics Delaware, Parent, Merger Sub 1 or the Company shall, nor shall
they permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action prior to
or following the Closing that would reasonably be expected to cause either of
the Mergers to fail to qualify as reorganizations within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Officers of each of Parent (or Nanometrics
Delaware, as applicable), Merger Sub 1 and the Company shall execute and
deliver to WSGR, counsel to Parent, and to Fredrikson and Byron, P.A., counsel
to the Company, certificates containing appropriate representations of Parent
(or Nanometrics Delaware, as applicable), Merger Sub 1 and the Company at
such time or times as may be reasonably requested by such Law firms,
including the effective date of the Registration and the Acquisition Merger
Effective Time, in connection with their respective deliveries of opinions
with respect to the Tax treatment of the Acquisition Merger.   Section 7.13
Takeover Statutes. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in
no event shall the approval of the Acquisition Merger and this Agreement by
the Company Board under Section 302A.673of the MBCA be withdrawn, revoked or
modified by the Company Board. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Acquisition Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board, or Parent
and the Parent Board, as applicable, shall promptly grant such approvals and
take such Lawful actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement or the Acquisition Merger, as the case may be, and otherwise take
such Lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and
any regulations promulgated thereunder, on such transactions.   Section 7.14
Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, each of
the Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be required (to the
extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company
Common Stock or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including, in each case,
derivative securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.   Section 7.15 Directorships. Effective
as of the Acquisition Merger Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
Nanometrics Delaware shall be expanded to seven (7) members, consisting of
three individuals that prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Time served
as directors of the Company (each, a "Company Director"); three individuals
that prior to the Migratory Merger Effective Time served as directors of
Parent (each, a "Parent Director"); and    71   one individual
acceptable to both Parent and the Company (the "Independent Director"). The
organizational documents of Nanometrics Delaware shall provide for three
classes of directors and staggered election of directors consistent with the
following. Classes I and II shall each consist of one Company Director and
one Parent Director. Class III shall consist of one Company Director,
one Parent Director and the Independent Director. Class I directors shall
serve for an initial term of one year and shall thereafter be elected to

to render such opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be deemed to be
satisfied with respect to the Company if WSGR renders such opinion to the
Company and (ii) if WSGR fails to render such opinion, this condition shall
