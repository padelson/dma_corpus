be taken to be the definitive "BGA Completion Statement" or "USG
Completion Statement" (as relevant) for the purposes of this Agreement, and

     | (a) | If USG and Boral have not been able to resolve the issues

at the same time.

 



     | (b) | The Independent Expert must be instructed by USG and Boral: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | to determine only the unresolved issues in the Dispute
Notice or Dispute Notices;

---|---|--- 



     | (c) | USG and Boral may make separate written submissions to the
Independent Expert (to be delivered within 14 days after the Independent
Expert is appointed) and may make a response to the submissions of the
other.  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | The Independent Expert will act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator in determining the dispute. The Independent Experts decision in
relation to the matters in its written determination will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties (except in the case of manifest error). 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 37 reaching its determination: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | apply the requirements of this clause 6 (and Schedule 9 or
Schedule 10 (as applicable)) insofar as they relate to financial and
accounting matters and the format of the respective completion statements;  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | not take into account any other dispute that may be ongoing
between the parties and unrelated to the Dispute Notice or Dispute Notices
submitted to the Independent Expert; and 
---|---|---

Independent Expert and not independent review. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | The Independent Expert must be instructed that, in resolving

any such item than the greatest value for such item claimed by either USG or
Boral in the written submissions to the Independent Expert or less than the

---|---|--- 



     | (g) | Any written correspondence between the Independent Expert
and any of the Parties must be copied to each of the other Parties at the same
time as it is sent to the principal recipient. 
---|---|---

Expert with any information, assistance and cooperation that the Independent
Expert reasonably requests to assist in making his or her determination.  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | The costs of the Independent Expert will be borne in the

agree to any customary terms of engagement of the Independent Expert,
including as to indemnities in favour of the Independent Expert 
---|---|--- 



   6.9 | Access 
---|--- 



     | (a) | USG must ensure that each USG Group Member permits
representatives of Boral and its advisers to have access to and take extracts
from the books, correspondence, accounts or other records relating to the USG

control as Boral and its advisers reasonably request in relation to the review
of, and agreement to, the USG Completion Statement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Boral must ensure that each Boral Group Member permits

permits representatives of USG, Boral and their respective advisers to have
access to and take extracts from the books, correspondence, accounts or other
records relating to the BGA Group and the USG Contributed Entities for the
period before Completion in their possession or control as USG, Boral and
their respective advisers reasonably request in relation to the preparation
and review of, and agreement to, the USG Completion Statement and the BGA
Completion Statement. 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 38 ---|--- 

If this clause 6 requires any disputed matters to be referred to an
Independent Expert for resolution but no Independent Expert determination on
the relevant matters is possible because:



     | (a) | USG and Boral do not agree on the Independent Expert and
none of the firms selected as potential Independent Experts agrees to the
accept the appointment; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | an Independent Expert is appointed but the Independent
Expert subsequently withdraws or advises that it is for any reason unable to
make a determination; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | for any other reason, 
---|---|--- 

and USG and Boral cannot within a further 14 days agree on the appointment of
an alternative Independent Expert, then the Independent Expert process will be
taken to have failed and any party may commence proceedings in a court of
competent jurisdiction in relation to the resolution of the relevant
disputed matters (on the basis that each party will for the avoidance of
doubt still have an obligation to make the payments required by clause 6.11).



   6.11 | Payment of final adjustments

to Boral Seller, as an increase to the Initial Purchase Price: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | an amount equal to 50% of the difference; less 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the amount (if any) by which the Initial Purchase Price
paid at Completion was increased under clause 6.3(c), 
---|---|--- 
 

provided that if the amount under clause 6.11(a)(i) above is smaller than the
amount under clause 6.11(a)(ii) above so that the calculation results in a
negative number (an Adjustment Shortfall):



     | (iii) | the Acquirer will have no obligation to make a payment to
Boral Seller under this clause 6.11(a); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | Boral Seller must instead pay to the Acquirer on the Final
Adjustment Date an amount equal to the relevant Adjustment Shortfall. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If the BGA Adjustment Amount finally agreed or determined in

Page 58 ---|--- 



 





   10.1 | Notice 
---|--- 

Without limiting any other rights of a Party under this Agreement:

 



     | (a) | if after Completion a Boral Party becomes aware of a Third
Party Claim or Tax Demand which may give rise to a Boral Claim against a USG
Group Member or a USG Claim against a Boral Group Member, Boral must promptly
give notice to USG of that Third Party Claim or Tax Demand, copying each
other Party under this agreement; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | if after Completion a USG Party becomes aware of a Third
Party Claim or Tax Demand which may give rise to a USG Claim against a Boral
Group Member or a Boral Claim against a USG Group Member, USG must promptly
give notice to Boral of that Third Party Claim or Tax Demand, copying each
other Party under this agreement. 
---|---|--- 

Any notice under clause 10.1(a) or clause 10.1(b) must include reasonable
details of the facts, matters or circumstances giving rise to the Third Party

   10.2 | Obligations not to Settle 
---|--- 



     | (a) | This clause 10.2(a) applies in relation to any Third Party

within their control as shareholders in SingCo to procure that no Joint
Venture Group Member Settles, 
---|---|--- 
 

the relevant Third Party Claim or Tax Demand without USGs prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. However, a
Boral Group Member or Joint Venture Group Member may pay any Tax to a Taxing
Authority by the due date for payment without affecting any Boral Group
Members rights under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Settlement effected without the prior written consent of USG (whether or not
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall in no event be determinative of the
validity of any Boral Claim against, or the amount of any Losses alleged to be
the responsibility of, any USG Group Member.



     | (b) | This clause 10.2(b) applies in relation to any Third Party
Claim or Tax Demand (whether or not notified under clause 10.1) that may lead

consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. However, a USG
Group Member or Joint Venture Group Member may pay any Tax to a Taxing
Authority by the due date for payment without affecting any USG Group Members
rights under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Settlement effected without the prior written consent of Boral (whether or
not unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall in no event be determinative of
the validity of any USG Claim against, or the amount of any Losses alleged to
be the responsibility of, any Boral Group Member

adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to clause 6.11, 6.13, 6.14 or 6.15
or the calculation or payment of the Earn-Out Amount (if any) pursuant to
clause 2.3(d) and to Schedule 8 of the Australasia Sale Agreement.

---|--- 

To the extent a Party admits (or is taken to have admitted) liability for
the whole or part of a Claim Amount pursuant to clause 11.2(c) or clause
