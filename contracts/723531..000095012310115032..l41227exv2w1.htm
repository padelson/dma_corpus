any payment therefor except as otherwise provided in this <U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U>, shall be
automatically cancelled and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the same. Each Option, to the extent unexercised as of the Effective
Time, shall thereafter no longer be exercisable but shall entitle (subject to compliance with the
immediately following sentence) each holder thereof (each, an &#147;<U>Option Holder</U>&#148;), in
cancellation and settlement therefor, to a payment in cash equal to (i)&nbsp;the excess, if any, of (x)
the Common Per Share Merger Consideration (subject to adjustment as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;3.4</U>
and <U>Section&nbsp;3.5</U> hereof) over (y)&nbsp;the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to
such Option, <U>multiplied by</U> (ii)&nbsp;the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Option immediately prior to its cancellation (such payment to be net of withholding and the
employee&#146;s portion of any employment Taxes actually paid to the appropriate taxing authority in
accordance with applicable laws, if any, and without interest), at the same time, in the same
manner and subject to the same conditions under which other Company Stockholders receive Common Per
Share Merger Consideration (collectively, such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the
&#147;<U>Option Payments</U>&#148;). For the avoidance of doubt, any Option for which the Common Per Share
Merger Consideration is less than or equal to the exercise price of such Option (an &#147;<U>Out of the
Money Option</U>&#148;) shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration, and
shall be canceled, as of the Closing Date, with no consideration delivered in exchange therefore,
and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
same. As a condition precedent to each Option Holder&#146;s right to receive the Option Payment, each
Option Holder shall deliver to Parent or the Transfer Agent, as applicable, an executed Letter of
Transmittal (which shall include an executed joinder to the Representative Agreement). As soon as
practicable, but in no event later than five (5)&nbsp;Business Days after the date hereof, the Company
shall mail to each Option Holder (1)&nbsp;a Letter of Transmittal (including a joinder to the
Representative Agreement) and (2)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the cancellation and
termination of the Option in exchange for the Option Payments contemplated to be paid to the Option
Holders pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U>. Upon the Parent&#146;s receipt of a duly completed Letter
of Transmittal (including an executed joinder to the Representative Agreement), Parent or the
Transfer Agent, as applicable, shall pay to such Option Holder (but in no event earlier than the
Effective Time), on behalf of the Company and subject to any applicable withholdings and Taxes, the
Option Payments due under this <U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U> with respect to such Option. Notwithstanding any
contrary provision set forth in this Agreement, neither Parent, nor the Transfer Agent, nor the
Representative shall pay to any Option Holder that portion of the Option Payment represented by
such Option Holder&#146;s share of the Escrow Funds until such time as such amount, if any, is
distributable pursuant to the terms and conditions of the General Escrow Agreement.

the Representative or Parent, as the case may be, in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;3.4(c)</U>. If
the Representative and Parent are unable to resolve all disagreements within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of

Parent and the Representative, then, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days thereafter, the Representative and

Arbitrator so selected will consider only those items and amounts set forth in the applicable
