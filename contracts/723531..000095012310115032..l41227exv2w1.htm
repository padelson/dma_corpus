 3.4 _Post-Closing Working Capital and Cash on Hand Adjustment._  

  

 (a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Representative a statement of the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Statement of Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and a statement of the Cash on Hand (the " _Statement of Cash on Hand_ "), together, in each case, with all supporting documentation, calculating, in accordance with the formula set forth on _Exhibit B_, the calculation of each Company Stockholders portion of the Merger Consideration based upon the calculation of the Merger Consideration payable at the Closing taking into account the Statement of Closing Net Working Capital and the Statement of Cash on Hand. The Statement of Closing Net Working Capital and Statement of Cash on Hand are collectively referred to herein as the " _Statements_." The Statement of Closing Net Working Capital shall be based upon the books and records of the Acquired Companies and shall be prepared in accordance with the definition of Closing Net Working Capital set forth in _Article I_ above. The Statement of Cash on Hand shall be based on the books and records of the Acquired Companies and shall be prepared in accordance with the definition of Cash on Hand set forth in  _Article I_ above. Until the Statements are finally determined pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ , Parent shall afford the Representative (and its representatives and advisors) reasonable access to all books and records and all financial and accounting personnel used to prepare, or otherwise relevant to the calculation of, the Statement under control of or in the possession of Parent or the Company (or their respective representatives and advisors). 

  

 (b) Each Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties unless the Representative shall, within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Statements, deliver to Parent written notice of disagreement with such Statement, which notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in reasonable detail, identify the specific items involved and the dollar amount of such disagreement. If the Representative shall deliver a notice of disagreement within the aforesaid thirty (30) day period, then the disputed matters shall be resolved by the Representative, on behalf of the Company Stockholders, and Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, amounts that are not subject to a written notice of disagreement or objection shall be remitted to the Representative or Parent, as the case may be, in accordance with _Section 3.4(c)_. If the Representative and Parent are unable to resolve all disagreements within thirty (30) days of receipt by Parent of a written notice of disagreement, or such longer period as may be agreed by Parent and the Representative, then, within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Representative and Parent shall send the items in dispute to be resolved by KPMG, or if KPMG should be unable or unwilling to be retained for this purpose, to be resolved by another auditor mutually agreeable to both Parent and the Representative (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "). The Accounting Arbitrator so selected will consider only those items and amounts set forth in the applicable Statement as to which Parent and the Representative have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified above and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Each Party may furnish to the Accounting Arbitrator such information and documents as it deems relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and information being concurrently given to the other Party. The Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve each item of disagreement based solely on the supporting material provided by the Parties and not pursuant to any independent review and may not assign a value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either Party, in each case as presented to the Accounting Arbitrator. The Accounting Arbitrator shall issue a detailed written report that sets forth the resolution of all 

   ##### 

   

 

items in dispute and that contains, as applicable, a final Statement of
Closing Net Working Capital and Statement of Cash on Hand and final copy of
the Per Share Payment Schedule calculating, in accordance with the formula
set forth on _Exhibit B_, the calculation of each Company Stockholders
portion of the Merger Consideration taking into account the final Statement
of Closing Net Working Capital and final Statement of Cash on Hand. Such
report shall be final and binding upon Parent and the Representative and the
Company Stockholders. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be borne on a proportionate basis by the Representative, on behalf of
the Company Stockholders from the Escrow Funds, on the one hand, and the
Parent, on the other hand, based on the inverse proportion of the respective
percentages of the dollar value of disputed issues determined in favor of the
Representative and Parent respectively. Parent and the Representative shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cooperate fully with
the Accounting Arbitrator and respond on a timely basis to all requests for
information or access to documents or personnel made by the Accounting
Arbitrator or by other Parties hereto, all with the intent to fairly and in
good faith resolve all disputes relating to any Statement as promptly
as reasonably practicable. 

   

 (c) If the amount representing the Closing Net Working Capital and Cash on Hand, in each case, as reflected in the applicable Statement as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 3.4_ differs from the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital and Estimated Cash on Hand, respectively as the case may be, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such difference. 

  

 If the adjustments, if any, under this _Section 3.4_ result in an aggregate reduction in the Merger Consideration, the Representative shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent (by wire transfer to an account designated in writing by Parent) from the Escrow Funds the amount of such reduction within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the adjustments. Conversely, if such adjustments result in an aggregate increase in the Merger Consideration, Parent shall, within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the adjustments, remit (i) the portion of the amount of such increase allocable to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the Per Share Payment Schedule to the Representative (on behalf of the Company Stockholders once they have complied with the conditions set forth in this _Article III_ for receipt of their respective portion of the Merger Consideration, or otherwise as set forth in this _Article III_ ) and (ii) the portion of the amount of such increase allocable to the Persons entitled to receive such amounts under the Incentive Compensation Plan to such Persons (net of withholding and the employees portion of any employment Taxes, if any, which shall be remitted instead by Parent to the applicable taxing authority) in accordance with the Per Share Payment Schedule. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 3.4_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the payments made by Parent or the Representative in respect of any adjustments pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ exceed an amount equal to the Escrow Funds.

 (i) a statement of the Customer Funds held by the Company as of the Closing Date, and setting forth the amount, if any, by which such Customer Funds are insufficient to satisfy, for the period ending on the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies obligations to collect, disburse or remit Customer Funds (including any penalties or interest imposed upon a customer of any of the Acquired Companies with respect to or arising out of the failure by such Acquired Company prior to the Closing to properly perform its contractual obligations to such customer with respect thereto) (the " _Statement of Customer Funds_ "), 

  

 (ii) a statement of the outstanding balance on the Designated Accounts Receivable as of the Reconciliation Date (the " _Statement of Accounts Receivable_ "), and 

  

 (iii) a certificate from Parents chief executive officer certifying that (x) Parent has prepared the Statement of Customer Funds and Statement of Accounts Receivable in accordance with this _Section 3.5_ and (y) Parents compliance with the covenants set forth in _Section 10.6_. 

  

 The Statement of Customer Funds and the Statement of Accounts Receivable shall be based upon the books and records of the Acquired Companies, and shall (x) include in the calculation of Customer Funds any accounts receivable which the Company had recorded in respect of such Customer Funds as of the Closing Date which have been collected since the Closing Date and (y) exclude in the calculation of Customer Funds any insufficiencies due to Tax Notices. Until the Statement of Customer Funds and the Statement of Accounts Receivable are finally determined pursuant to this  _Section 3.5_, Parent shall afford the Representative (and its representatives and advisors) reasonable access to all books and records and all financial and accounting personnel used to prepare, or otherwise relevant to the calculation of, the Statement of Customer Funds under control of or in the possession of Parent or the Company (or their respective representatives and advisors). 

  

 (b) The Statement of Customer Funds and the Statement of Accounts Receivable shall be final and binding on the Parties unless the Representative shall, within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Statement of Customer Funds and the Statement of Accounts Receivable, delivers to Parent written notice of disagreement with such Statement of Customer Funds or the Statement of Accounts Receivable, or both, as applicable, which notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in reasonable detail, identify the specific items involved and the dollar amount of such disagreement. If the Representative shall raise any objections within the aforesaid thirty (30) day period, then the disputed matters shall be resolved by the Representative, on behalf of the Company Stockholders, and Parent. If the Representative and Parent are unable to resolve all disagreements within thirty (30) days of receipt by Parent of a written notice of disagreement, or such longer period as may be agreed by Parent and the Representative, then, within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Representative and Parent shall send the items in dispute to be resolved by the Accounting Arbitrator. The Accounting Arbitrator so selected will consider only those items and amounts set forth in the Statement of Customer Funds or and the Statement of Accounts Receivable, or both, as applicable, as to which Parent and the Representative have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified above 

   ##### 

  

 

and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement. Each Party may furnish to the Accounting Arbitrator such
information and documents as it deems relevant, with copies of such
submission and all such documents and information being concurrently given to
the other Party. The Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve each item of
disagreement based solely on the supporting material provided by the Parties
and not pursuant to any independent review and may not assign a value to any
particular item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either Party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either
Party, in each case as presented to the Accounting Arbitrator. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall issue a detailed written report that sets forth the
resolution of all items in dispute and that contains, as applicable, a final
Statement of Customer Funds and a final Statement of Accounts
Receivable. Such report shall be final and binding upon Parent and the
Representative and the Company Stockholders. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne on a proportionate basis by the
Representative, on behalf of the Company Stockholders from the Escrow Funds,
on the one hand, and the Parent, on the other hand, based on the inverse
proportion of the respective percentages of the dollar value of disputed
issues determined in favor of the Representative and Parent respectively.
Parent and the Representative shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cooperate fully with the Accounting Arbitrator and
respond on a timely basis to all requests for information or access to
documents or personnel made by the Accounting Arbitrator or by other Parties
hereto, all with the intent to fairly and in good faith resolve all
disputes relating to the Statement of Customer Funds and the Statement of
Accounts Receivable as promptly as reasonably practicable. 

   

 (c) The amount of any outstanding balance on the Designated Accounts Receivable as reflected in the Statement of Accounts Receivable as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 3.5_ , shall be added to any insufficiency in the Customer Funds as reflected in the Statement of Customer Funds as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 3.5_ (such sum to be the " _Adjustment Amount_ "). The Representative shall, within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the Statement of Accounts Receivable and the Statement of Customer Funds (the " _Adjustment Payment Date_ "), pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent (by wire transfer to an account designated in writing by Parent) from the Escrow Funds, the amount, if any, by which (i) the Adjustment Amount, exceeds (ii) the amount, if any, by which (x) the Basket Amount, exceeds (y) all Losses pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_ that have been incurred and claimed by a Parent Indemnified Party as of the Adjustment Payment Date, if any, to which the Basket Amount applies in accordance with _Section 11.7(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 3.5_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Representative have any payment obligation in respect of any adjustments pursuant to this  _Section 3.5_ other than from the then-current balance of the Escrow Funds.

 6.3 _Schedules Update_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall supplement or amend the Schedules to this Agreement if the Company becomes aware of any matter heretofore existing or hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedules or which is otherwise necessary to correct any information in such Schedules which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. For purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in  _Article IV,_ for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in  _Section 8.2(a),_ and for indemnification under _Section 11.3_, the Schedules delivered by the Company shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude any information contained in any subsequent supplement or amendment thereto, unless for purposes of indemnification under _Section 11.3(a)_ , such item of information contained in any subsequent supplement or amendment thereto (a) only discloses a matter arising out of a fact or facts arising after the date hereof, and (b) does not involve a Loss that is (i) individually with respect to any individual subsequent disclosure, or (ii) in the aggregate with respect to all related subsequent disclosures arising out of the same facts, 

   ##### 

  

 

greater than $25,000, in which case, Parent will not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_ for such matter. 

   

 For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that a Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section 11.3(a)_ (subject to the terms of _Article XI_) with respect to any Subsequent Disclosure that involves a Loss that is (i) individually with respect to any individual Subsequent Disclosure, or (ii) in the aggregate with respect to all related Subsequent Disclosures arising out of the same facts, greater than $25,000.

The Company shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies and their officers, directors, agents and representatives to, terminate any and all negotiations or discussions with any third party regarding any proposal concerning any merger or recapitalization involving the Acquired Companies, sale of Company Shares, any sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Acquired Companies or other similar transaction.

 6.6 _Access_. The Company will permit Parent and its representatives (including legal counsel and accountants) to have, upon prior written notice, reasonable access during normal business hours and under reasonable circumstances, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations of the Acquired Companies, to the premises (subject and pursuant to the terms of the Leases), books, records (including tax records and records regarding the Customer Funds Accounts), contracts and documents of or pertaining to the Acquired Companies. Neither Parent nor any of its representatives shall contact any employee, customer, supplier or landlord of any of the Acquired Companies without the prior written consent of an officer of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Parent shall comply with, and shall cause its representatives to comply with, all of their obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 6.6_, which agreement will remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in this _Article VI_ to the contrary, the Company may withhold from Parent

and Merger Sub (x) any document or information that is subject to the terms of
a confidentiality agreement with a third party, (y) any document or
information regarding the Companys entry into or conducting of a competitive
sale process prior to the execution of this Agreement or (z) such portions of
documents or information relating to pricing or other matters that are highly
sensitive and the exchange of such documents (or portions thereof) or
information, as determined by the Companys outside counsel, might reasonably
result in antitrust difficulties between the Company and Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates. Each Acquired Company and Parent shall cooperate
according to the procedures described on _Exhibit E_ with regard to the
Customer Funds. 

   

 6.7 _280G Matters_.

Prior to submission of such payments for Section 280G Approval, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers of the right to receive any Section 280G Payments from any individual entitled to such payments.

 (b) All refunds (whether in the form of an actual refund or a credit against Taxes due) for Taxes received by or with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be the property of the Company Stockholders and such refunds, plus any interest received from the applicable taxing authority in connection with the refund, shall be paid or caused to be paid by Parent to the Representative for distribution to the Company Stockholders promptly upon receipt from the applicable taxing authority (including as a result of using a credit on an Tax Return).

  

 (c) The Company shall prepare and file on a timely basis all Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary due on or prior to the Closing Date, and such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the procedures and practices of the Company as in existence as of the date hereof. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared all

    ##### 

  

     

Tax Returns of the Company and each Company Subsidiary due after the Closing
Date, which Tax Returns shall be filed on a timely basis. To the extent that
any Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary filed after the
Closing Date relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the procedures and practices of the
Company as in existence as of the date hereof. To the extent any Tax Returns
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary filed after the Closing Date may
reasonably be expected to impact Taxes due for any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided any such Tax Return (and
all relevant work papers and other items required to understand such Tax
Return or other items as reasonably requested by the Representative) to the
Representative at least sixty (60) days prior to the due date of such Tax
Return (after applicable extensions) for the Representatives review
and comment. Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, to incorporate any reasonable comments provided by the
Representative with respect to such Tax Returns and timely file such Tax
Returns with the appropriate taxing authority. Parent shall not (i) amend,
modify, or refile, or allow to be amended, modified, or refiled, any Tax
Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (in whole or in part) for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make or change any Tax election with effect in
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) take any other action that would
take effect in a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (iv) take any other action that
would take effect in a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written
consent of the Representative (which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). 

  

 (d) Parent and the Representative shall provide, and shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to provide, each other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the others in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding relating to Taxes arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Such assistance shall include making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns and supporting material. The Party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the assisting Party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing assistance. Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to, retain for the full period of any statute of limitations and provide the others with any records or information that may be relevant to such preparation, audit, examination, proceeding or determination. The Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and any Company Subsidiary, to cooperate with the Representative to obtain any refunds (including filing amended returns) that would result in the payment to, or for the benefit of, the Company Stockholders under _Section 10.1_.

  

 (e) If in connection with any examination, investigation, audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding in respect of any Tax Return or Taxes with respect to the income or operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, any Governmental Authority issues to the Company or any Company Subsidiary a notice of an audit, examination, investigation, or other administrative or judicial proceeding, a request for documents or other information, written notice of deficiency, a notice of reassessment, a proposed adjustment, an assertion of claim or demand concerning the Taxes or the taxable period covered by such Tax Return, Parent shall notify the Representative of its receipt of such communication from the governmental body or authority within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving such notice of deficiency, reassessment, adjustment or assertion of claim or demand. Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to settle or

    ##### 

  

     

otherwise resolve any issue with respect to any Taxes of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary if such settlement or other resolution could result in the
Company Stockholders being liable for any amounts pursuant to this Agreement
without the prior written consent of Representative. The Representative shall
have the right to control any examination, investigation, audit, or
other administrative or judicial proceeding in respect of any Tax Return of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
provided that Parent, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to
participate in any such contest. At the request of the Representative, Parent
shall resolve and settle, and shall cause the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to resolve and settle, any issue related to Taxes for any Pre-
Closing Tax Date on terms acceptable to the Representative and the applicable
taxing authority. If the Representative chooses not to control any contest to
which it has a right to control under this _Section 10.1(e)_, Escrow
Funds shall be used to reimburse Parent for Parents out-of-pocket costs in
defending, prosecuting, settling and resolving the contest. 

  

 (f) All federal, state, local, foreign and other transfers, sales, use or similar Tax applicable to, imposed upon or arising out of the Merger shall be borne by Parent. Parent shall indemnify and hold the Company Stockholders and the Representative harmless from such Taxes to the extent imposed on the Company Stockholders or the Representative. Parent shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  

 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Incomes Taxes of the Acquired Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Acquired Companies hold a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (including amortization and depreciation deductions) shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date shall be treated for purposes of this _Section 10.1_, and for purposes of filing all Income Tax Returns of the Parent, Company and any Company Subsidiary, as occurring on the date after the Closing Date.

  

 (h) None of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company nor any of their Affiliates shall make any election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 (i) Parent and Merger Sub shall not take any action with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

    ##### 

   

    

 (j) All indemnification payments under _Article XI_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration, unless otherwise required by a final determination of an applicable taxing authority.

  

 (k) Recovery against the Escrow Amount constitutes Parent Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or other claims against the Company Stockholders relating or arising under this _Section 10.1_.

  

 10.2 _Further Assurances_. At any time or from time to time up to one (1) year after the Closing, each of the Parties hereto shall, at the request of the other Party hereto and at such requesting Partys expense, execute and deliver any further instruments or documents and take all such further actions as are reasonably requested of it in order to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 10.3 _Director and Officer Insurance._

  

 (a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall ensure each of the Acquired Companies does not amend, alter, repeal or modify any provision in any of the Acquired Companies Organizational Documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any officers and directors in any way that diminishes or adversely affects the right of any officer or director of any such Acquired Company holding such office prior to Closing for any acts or omissions that occurred prior to Closing (unless required by Law), it being the intent of the Parties that the officers and directors of any of the Acquired Companies who were officers and directors prior to the Closing (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification for any acts or omissions that occurred prior to Closing to the full extent provided for under applicable Law.

  

 (b) At the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming the Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall not, and shall cause the Company to not, cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect.

  

 (c) In the event Parent, the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 10.3_. The provisions of this _Section 10.3_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons.

  

 10.4 _Employee Matters_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 10.4_, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide employees of the Acquired Companies (" _Company_

    ##### 

  

     

 _Employees_ ") as of the Closing Date with salaries, bonuses, benefits,
benefit plans and programs no less favorable in the aggregate to those set
forth on _Schedule 4.19(a)_ and in the Companys commissions plans for a
period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date; provided
that the foregoing shall not in any way prohibit or restrict the Parent or
an Acquired Company from terminating any Company Employee for cause, which
shall include violation of any employment agreement or employment policy of
an Acquired Company, and further, with respect to any Company Employee who
voluntarily terminates employment with an Acquired Company or for
whom employment with an Acquired Company was terminated for cause, the
foregoing shall not require the Parent or an Acquired Company to provide any
compensation or benefits to such terminated Company Employee after such
employment has been terminated except as may be required by Law. Parent
will indemnify the Company Stockholder Indemnified Parties from and against
any Losses that may be incurred by them under the WARN Act arising on or
after the Closing as a result of any action or omission of the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary occurring on or after the Closing. For
purposes of participation of Company Employees in a benefit plan of Parent or
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) (a " _Parent Benefit
Plan_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with all years of service
for which such Company Employee was credited before the Closing Date under
any analogous Employee Benefit Plans. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Parent Benefit Plans; (ii) for purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Benefit Plan to be waived for
such Company Employee; and (iii) Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents under an
Employee Benefit Plan which is a welfare plan during the portion of the
plan year of the Employee Benefit Plan ending on the date such Company
Employees participation in the corresponding Parent Benefit Plan begins to
be taken into account under such Parent Benefit Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for such year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such Parent Benefit Plan. 

  

 10.5 _Incentive Compensation Escrow_. The Representative shall maintain the Incentive Compensation Escrow in accordance with the Incentive Compensation Plan. After the Closing, Parent or the Company shall, within five (5) days after any participant in the Incentive Compensation Plan separates from employment with the Company, notify the Representative in writing of such separation and include a certified statement as to whether such separation was a termination by the Company with or without cause, a resignation by participant or a separation due to death or disability. Upon receiving such notice, the Representative will promptly pay, or cause the Escrow Agent to pay, any amounts due to such participant from the Incentive Compensation Escrow, if any, to the Company to be paid to such participant in accordance with the Incentive Compensation Plan (net of withholding and the employees portion of any employment Taxes, if any, which shall be remitted instead by Parent to the applicable taxing authority). When any amounts remaining in the Incentive Compensation Escrow are to be released to the participants upon the termination of such Incentive Compensation Escrow, the Representative shall promptly pay, or cause the Escrow Agent to pay, such amounts to the Company to be paid to such participants in accordance with the Incentive Compensation Plan

    ##### 

  

     

(net of withholding and the employees portion of any employment Taxes, if
any, which shall be remitted instead by Parent to the applicable taxing
authority). 

  

 10.6 _Collection of Designated Accounts Receivable and Additional Designated Accounts Receivable_. After the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the Designated Accounts Receivable and any deficiency in the Customer Funds which, if collected, would reduce any payment obligation pursuant to _Section 3.5_ (each, a " _Customer Funds Shortfall_ "). For purposes of this  _Section 10.6_, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall include, without limitation, (a) withholding delivery of W-2 statements to any customer who owes the Company a Customer Funds Shortfall, (b) asserting any and all contract rights of Parent or the Company in respect of a Customer Funds Shortfall, (c) obtaining promissory notes or other payment arrangements to collect the Customer Funds Shortfall and (d) otherwise implementing the ordinary course collection procedures and efforts of Parent and the Company in respect of the Customer Funds Shortfall; provided that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to commence any litigation, suit, arbitration, action or enforcement proceeding to collect any portion of the Customer Funds Shortfall. In addition, after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to settle and collect any amounts owing to the Surviving Corporation in respect of Tax Notices which, if settled and/or collected, as applicable, would reduce any indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section 11.3(d)_, including without limitation by implementing the ordinary course collection procedures and efforts of Parent and the Company in respect of the settlement and collection of such Tax Notices.

  

 10.7 _2010 Discretionary Bonuses_. After the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay any bonuses relating to the period prior to the Closing Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with the Companys past practice in accordance with the terms for such bonuses. To the extent any such bonuses are discretionary, (a) the president of the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to determine in good faith if and to what extent such bonuses will be paid (for all persons other than himself) and (b) the president of the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to 100% of the discretionary portion of any of his bonuses for such period. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.7 to the contrary, the amounts of any such bonus shall not exceed the target amount for such bonus set forth on _Schedule 4.19(a)_.

   

ARTICLE XI 

   

 _INDEMNIFICATION_  

 

 11.1 _Survival of the Company s Warranties and Covenants; Time Limits on Indemnification Obligations_. All representations and warranties of the Company, the Representative and the Company Stockholders contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing hereunder for a period of fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date and then terminate, provided, however, that the covenants set forth in this Agreement shall survive until the date on which the performance of such covenant is completed and then terminate. Notice of any claim for indemnification hereunder must be given prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in this _Section 11.1_ ; provided that so long as such notice is so given any claim

    ##### 

  

     

may continue to be asserted and indemnified against until finally resolved,
whether or not the settlement or any proceeding with respect to such claim
occurs, in whole or in part, during or after the applicable survival period
set forth in this _Section 11.1_. 

  

 11.2 _Survival of Parent s and Merger Subs Representations, Warranties and Covenants; Time Limits on Indemnification Obligations_. All of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub shall survive the Closing hereunder for a period of fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date and then terminate, provided, however, that the covenants set forth in this Agreement shall survive until the date on which the performance of such covenant is completed and then terminate. Notice of any claim for indemnification hereunder must be given prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in this _Section 11.2_ (the _"Survival Period_ "); provided that so long as such notice is so given any claim may continue to be asserted and indemnified against until finally resolved, whether or not the settlement or any proceeding with respect to such claim occurs, in whole or in part, during or after the Survival Period. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any other notice that may be given by any Parent Indemnified Party, notice with respect to any claim to any portion of the Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to have been timely given prior to the expiration of the Survival Period if Parent shall have delivered the Statement of Customer Funds and the Statement of Accounts Receivable prior to the expiration of the Survival Period, and any claim with respect to any portion of the Adjustment Amount may continue to be asserted and indemnified against until finally resolved, whether or not the settlement or any proceeding with respect to such claim occurs, in whole or in part, during or after the Survival Period.

  

 11.3 _Indemnification Relating to the Company_. From and after the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub and its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (each, a " _Parent Indemnified Party_ "), shall be indemnified from the Escrow Funds (to the extent of available funds) and in accordance with and subject to this  _Article XI_ and held harmless by the Company Stockholders from and against, and Parent Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed from the Escrow Funds for, any and all losses, charges, claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, interest, awards, demands, offsets, and reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and attorneys fees (including any such reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys fees incurred in enforcing a partys right to indemnification against any indemnifying party or with respect to any appeal) (hereinafter, a " _Loss_ " or the " _Losses_ ") sustained or incurred by any Parent Indemnified Party resulting from:

  

 (a) any breach of a representation or warranty made by the Company in _Article IV_ of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_;

  

 (b) any breach of a covenant made by the Company in this Agreement (other than a breach of  _Section 6.3_);

  

 (c) any Tax liability of any of the Acquired Companies relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and all Taxes that are attributable to any Liability by reason of any of the Acquired Companies being liable under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state or local law) for the Taxes of a consolidated group (other than a group the

    ##### 

  

     

common parent of which is any of the Acquired Companies) of which an Acquired
Company was a member on or prior to the Closing Date; 

  

 (d) any liability of the Company for Taxes reasonably determined by the Company to be a payment obligation of the Company, penalties or interest, in each case arising out of notices issued by any taxing authority resulting from any incorrect or inadequate payment of Taxes which were deemed to be due during the period prior to the Closing Date by the Company on behalf of its customers (each, a " _Tax Notice_ "), but only to the extent such liability is assessed and results in payment by the Company to the relevant taxing authority (with the parties expressly acknowledging and agreeing that any Tax Notice, or any portion of any Tax Notice, which is resolved so as to result in the relevant taxing authority owing any payments to the Company or its customers shall not be a matter for which indemnification is available hereunder, regardless of when and to what extent such taxing authority ultimately makes such payment); and

  

 (e) any Claim in connection with this Agreement by any Person against any of the Acquired Companies or the Parent with respect to (i) the calculation of the Per Share Payment Schedule, (ii) any discrepancy in payments made by Parent in reliance on the Per Share Payment Schedule, and (iii) the Representatives failure to make any payment required to be made by the Representative to any Person pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Representative Agreement.

  

 In accordance with _Section 13.17_, all claims payable to a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 11.3_ shall be negotiated, settled and paid on behalf of each Company Stockholder only by the Representative from the Escrow Funds and for purposes of  _Section 11.5_ below, and the Representative shall be deemed to have full authority to act on behalf of the Indemnifying Party with respect to any Company Stockholder that is an Indemnifying Party under _Section 11.5_.

  

 11.4 _Indemnification by Parent_. From and after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify, defend and save the Company Stockholders, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (each, a " _Company Stockholder Indemnified Party_ ") harmless from and against, and shall promptly pay to a Company Stockholder Indemnified Party or reimburse a Company Stockholder Indemnified Party for, any and all Losses sustained or incurred by any Company Stockholder Indemnified Party resulting from:

  

 (a) any breach of a representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_;

  

 (b) any breach of a covenant made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement;

  

 (c) any Tax liability of any of the Acquired Companies or Parent and any consolidated group for Tax purposes of which Parent is a member for the Post-Closing Tax Period; and

    ##### 

  

    

 (d) any Claim in connection with this Agreement by any Person against any of the Company Stockholders or the Representative with respect to Parents failure to make any payment required to be made by Parent to such Person pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

  

 In accordance with _Section 13.17_, all claims brought by any Company Stockholder Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 11.4_, shall be brought, prosecuted, negotiated and settled only by and any indemnification payments shall be made only to, the Representative, for purposes of _Section 11.5_ below, and the Representative shall be deemed to be the Indemnified Party, with respect to any Company Stockholder Indemnified Party that is an Indemnified Party under _Section 11.5_.

  

 11.5 _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_. Other than a claim involving the Tax Representations and Covenants, which procedure is set forth in and which shall be governed exclusively by _Section 10.1_, in the event that subsequent to the Closing, any Person that is or may be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives notice of the assertion of any claim, issuance of any order or the commencement of any action or proceeding by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party, including, without limitation, any Governmental Authority (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), against such Indemnified Party, against which a party to this Agreement is or may be required to provide indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice thereof together with a statement of any available information regarding such claim to the Indemnifying Party, but in any event within fifteen (15) days after learning of such claim (or within such shorter time as may be necessary to give the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to respond to and defend such claim), provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify with respect to a Third Party Claim only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party actually has been prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give notice as required. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right upon written notice to the Indemnified Party (the " _Defense Notice_ ") within thirty (30) days after receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, to conduct at its expense the defense against such claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does elect to conduct the defense of the subject claim, the Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials as may be reasonably requested by it, with any reasonable third party costs incurred in connection with such Indemnified Partys cooperation being at the Indemnifying Partys expense. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing, provided that the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such participation in the defense thereof. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of any claim to the extent that (i) claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to prosecute or defend such matter diligently and in good faith, or (iv) the amount of Losses arising out of such Third Party Claim, as determined by the Indemnifying Party in good faith, exceeds the total Escrow Funds in the Escrow account at any time. If an offer is made to finally settle a Third

    ##### 

  

     

Party Claim, which offer the Indemnifying Party is permitted to settle under
this _Section 11.5_ only upon the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, and the sole relief provided to the third party pursuant to such offer
is monetary damages that do not exceed the total Escrow Funds in the Escrow
account at the time, and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree
to such offer, the Indemnifying Party will give prompt written notice to the
Indemnified Party to that effect. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent
to such firm offer within twenty (20) calendar days after its receipt of such
notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third
Party Claim and, in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying
Party as to such Third Party Claim will not exceed the amount of the total
Escrow Funds in the Escrow account at the time. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Party shall settle any Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). With respect to any
Third Party Claim subject to indemnification under this _Section 11.5_, the
Parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in full (to the
extent possible) the confidentiality of all confidential information of the
Acquired Companies and Parent and all attorney-client and work-product
privileges with respect to all information generated, produced or disclosed.
In connection therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use its
commercially reasonable efforts, in respect of any Third Party Claim in which
it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of
confidential information of the Acquired Companies and Parent (consistent
with applicable law and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications
between any Party hereto and their respective counsel responsible for or
participating in the defense of any Third Party Claim shall, to the
extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or
work-product privilege. 

  

 11.6 _Calculation of Losses._

  

 (a) The amount of any Losses payable under this _Article XI_ by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i) amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies (but not including (y) any self-insurance of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (including any Acquired Company), or (z) any insurance policy under which the Company Subsidiary is the insurer to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (including any Acquired Company)) or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor and (ii) the reduction in Taxes realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under such applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses or realizes a reduction in Taxes attributable to a Loss subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made, expense incurred or reduction in Taxes realized by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by or realized by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such insurance coverage or from such other Person alleged to have responsibility therefore, provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to seek, claim and collect indemnification under this _Article XI_ without first being required to assert any claim, right or remedy with respect to such insurance coverage or other Persons. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses indemnified by the Indemnifying Party.

    ##### 

  

    

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this _Article XI_ for any (i) Losses relating to any matter to the extent that there is included in the final Statement of Closing Net Working Capital determined in accordance with _Section 3.4_, a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter, (ii) Losses relating to any matter to the extent resolved in accordance with _Section 3.5_, (iii) Losses to the extent the Indemnified Party had otherwise been compensated therefor pursuant to the adjustments to the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 3.4_ or (iv) any Losses to the extent that the Indemnified Party has already previously recovered the same Losses in respect of the same claim (i.e., no "double counting" of Losses).

  

 (c) For purposes of determining whether an Indemnified Party has a right to indemnification under _Section 11.3(a)_ or _Section 11.4(a)_ and for determining the amount of Losses with respect thereto, the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that are qualified by reference to "material," "materially," "Material Adverse Change," "Material Adverse Effect," or any similar term shall be deemed to have been made without giving effect to such materiality qualifiers.

  

 11.7 _Limitations on Indemnities._

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no claim for a Loss pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_ or _Section 11.3(d)_ of this Agreement, until the Losses incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties exceed in the aggregate One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Basket Amount_ "), and then only to the extent of such excess; provided that for any Losses claimed after the Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to _Section 3.5_, such Adjustment Amount shall be deemed to be a reduction (but not below zero) of the Basket Amount.

  

 (b) The aggregate amount required to be paid to the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed in the aggregate an amount equal to the Escrow Amount (the " _Cap Amount_ ") and recovery pursuant to this Agreement shall further be limited to an amount not to exceed the Escrow Funds available on any given payment date. In addition, in no event shall any Parent Indemnified Party be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of consequential, incidental or indirect damages, lost profits or punitive damages (other than consequential, incidental or indirect damages, lost profits or punitive damages payable to third parties).

  

 11.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, except for any claim with respect to actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional misconduct in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or the representations, warranties or covenants hereunder (a) the remedies set forth in this _Article XI_ constitute the sole and exclusive remedies for recovery of Losses and any other amounts, and (b) recovery against the Escrow Funds pursuant to this _Article XI_ (and the terms of the General Escrow Agreement) constitutes a Parent Indemnified Partys sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including any relating to environmental, health or safety matters. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, the limitations of liability set forth in this _Article XI_ shall not apply to any claim with respect to actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional misconduct in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or the representations,

    ##### 

  

     

warranties or covenants hereunder; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
none of the Company Stockholders shall have any liability, directly or
indirectly, in respect of any claim for actual fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or intentional misconduct, unless such Company Stockholder
bears direct culpability for such actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation
or intentional misconduct. 

  

 11.9 _No Contribution_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at and after the Effective Time it is understood that no Company Stockholder Indemnified Party shall have any rights of recourse, whether for contribution, by virtue of subrogation or otherwise, against any Acquired Company for any payments that any of Company Stockholder Indemnified Party makes, or is obligated to make, under this _Article XI_ or any other section of this Agreement.

 (c) _Exculpation_.

 (ii) The Representative shall have no obligations to make any payments, including on behalf of any Company Stockholder or any other Person.

The Company Stockholders will jointly and 

   ##### 

  

   

severally indemnify the Representative from any Losses arising out of his
serving as the Representative hereunder. 

 

 13.18 _Representation of the Representative and the Company Stockholders and Affiliates_. The Parties agree that the fact that Kirkland and Ellis LLP may have represented the Representative and its and the Companys Affiliates prior to Closing, and has represented the Company prior to Closing, and such representations shall not prevent Kirkland and Ellis LLP from representing the Representative, such Affiliates, or their respective equityholders, officers, or managers in connection with any matters involving, including without limitation any disputes with, any of the parties to this Agreement after Closing. The Parties agree to take the steps necessary to ensure any privilege attaching as a result of legal counsel representing the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with this transaction will survive Closing and will remain in effect, provided that such privilege from and after the Closing will be jointly controlled by the Representative and the Company, and may only be waived with both of their consent.
