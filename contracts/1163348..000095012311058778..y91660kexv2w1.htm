statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Transatlantic (i)&nbsp;maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)

the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms, including that information required to be
disclosed by Transatlantic in the reports that it files and submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to management of Transatlantic, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii)&nbsp;has disclosed, based upon the most recent (prior
to the date of this Agreement) evaluation by the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of Transatlantic of Transatlantic&#146;s internal control over financial reporting, to its
auditors and the audit committee of the Transatlantic Board (A)&nbsp;all significant deficiencies and

reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect its ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Transatlantic&#146;s internal
