 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 12, 2011, is by and among Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, AG, a corporation limited by shares organized under the laws of Switzerland (" _Allied World_ "), GO Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied World (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Transatlantic Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Transatlantic_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Allied World and Transatlantic deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and its respective stockholders that Allied World and Transatlantic engage in a business combination in order to advance the long-term strategic business interests of each of Allied World and Transatlantic; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Allied World and Transatlantic have determined that such business combination shall be effected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement through the Merger in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Allied World and Transatlantic and the sole member of Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger, and determined that the terms of this Agreement and the Merger are in the respective best interests of Allied World, Transatlantic or Merger Sub, as the case may be, and the stockholders of Allied World and Transatlantic and the sole member of Merger Sub; and 

  

 WHEREAS, Allied World, Transatlantic and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I. 
 THE MERGER 

    

 1.1 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (" _Delaware Law_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Transatlantic (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the separate limited liability company existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Transatlantic shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). As a result of the Merger, Transatlantic shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied World. 

   

 1.2 Closing. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall take place at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the second Business Day) following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject 

   ##### 

  

    

to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those
conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in
writing between Allied World and Transatlantic. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

   

 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file (i) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, the certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") and (ii) with the appropriate Swiss Governmental Entity, the Restated Articles, in each case in such form as required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of Delaware Law and the Laws of Switzerland, as applicable, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings required under applicable Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Allied World and Transatlantic shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). The Restated Articles shall be filed with the appropriate Swiss Governmental Entity immediately prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger and shall become effective at the Effective Time. 

   

 1.4 Effects. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. 

   

 1.5 Certificates of Incorporation and Bylaws.

The certificate of incorporation of Transatlantic, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated at the Effective Time to read in the form of _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended and restated, such certificate of incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The bylaws of Transatlantic shall be amended and restated at the Effective Time to read in the form of _Exhibit B_ and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) _Allied World Articles of Association_. Subject to receipt of the Allied World Articles Amendment Stockholder Approval, the Allied World Articles (as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall be amended and restated (the " _Allied World Articles Amendment_ ") as of the Effective Time to read in the form of _Exhibit C_ (the " _Restated Articles_ ") and, as so amended and restated, such articles of association shall be the articles of association of Allied World until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The Restated Articles shall provide, among other things, that the name of Allied World shall be changed at the Effective Time to "TransAllied Group Holdings, AG." 

   

 (c) _Allied World Organizational Regulations_. The organizational regulations of Allied World shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to read in the form of _Exhibit D_ and, as so amended and restated, such organizational regulations shall be the

ARTICLE II. 
 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

    

 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Allied World, Transatlantic, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of Transatlantic Common Stock or any limited liability company interest of Merger Sub: 

    

 (i) _Limited Liability Company Interest of Merger Sub_. The sole limited liability company interest of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one hundred (100) fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (ii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Transatlantic (the " _Transatlantic Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Transatlantic or its Subsidiaries and each share of Transatlantic Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Allied World, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (iii) _Conversion of Transatlantic Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.2(e)_ , each share of Transatlantic Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ ), shall be converted into the right to receive 0.88 (the ratio of such number to 1, the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable registered ordinary shares, par value CHF 15.00 per share (as may be adjusted in connection with the payment of dividends by virtue of a par value reduction, as approved by Allied Worlds shareholders at its 2011 annual general meeting), of Allied World (the " _Allied World Shares_ " and, such Allied World Shares into which shares of Transatlantic Common Stock are converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, together with any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All shares of Transatlantic Common Stock converted pursuant to this  _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Transatlantic Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of such shares of Transatlantic Common Stock in accordance with  _Section 2.2(c)_, without interest. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (and as permitted by _Article V_), the outstanding shares of Allied World Capital Stock or Transatlantic Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of Allied World Capital Stock and the holders of Transatlantic Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

    

 2.2 Exchange of Certificates. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Allied World and Transatlantic shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company to be mutually agreed upon to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging (i) certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Transatlantic Common Stock (" _Certificates_ ") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Transatlantic Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, for the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to an exchange agent agreement. Allied World shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Effective Time, (x) evidence of Allied World Shares in book-entry form issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (and/or certificates representing such shares, at Allied Worlds election), and (y) cash sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional Allied World Shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_.

Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) Allied World Shares representing that number of whole Allied World Shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the aggregate number of shares of Transatlantic Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and (y) a check representing cash in lieu of fractional shares that the holder has the right to 

      #####

other distributions that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_,
each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Merger Consideration that the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share has the right to receive in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_
(and cash in respect of any dividends or other distributions pursuant to

From and after the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of Transatlantic other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions that holders have the right to receive upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ , without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of Transatlantic shall be closed with respect to all shares of Transatlantic Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

      ##### 

  

    

 _Section 2.1_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Allied World
Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Transatlantic Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of an Allied World
Share (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and
upon surrender thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional amount multiplied by the last reported sale price of Allied World
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as reported in _The
Wall Street Journal_ (Northeast edition) or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by Allied World and
Transatlantic) on the first trading day immediately following the date on

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Allied World, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Allied World for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. 

   

 (g) _No Liability_. None of Allied World, Transatlantic, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with this _Article II_ that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the second anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Allied World on a daily basis, _provided_ that, subject to  _Section 2.2(g)_, no such investment or losses will affect the cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Any interest or other amounts received with respect to such investments shall be paid to Allied World. 

   

 (i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Allied World and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted, withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Allied World or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Allied World or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section 2.2(g)_, Allied World) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

       ##### 

  

     

 (c) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Transaction_ " means, with respect to Allied World or Transatlantic, as the case may be (for this purpose, the " _Target Party_ "), any of (i) a transaction, including any tender offer, exchange offer or share exchange, pursuant to which any third Person (or group) other than the other party to this Agreement (the " _Non-Target Party_ ") or such third Persons Affiliates, or the stockholders of such third Person, directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or ordinary shares, as applicable, of the Target Party or of the outstanding voting power of the Target Party (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such common stock or ordinary shares or other securities representing such voting power), whether from the Target Party or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, amalgamation, consolidation or business combination pursuant to which any third Person or group of Persons (other than the Non-Target Party or its Affiliates) party thereto, or the stockholders of such third Person or Persons, beneficially owns or would beneficially own 10% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or ordinary shares, as applicable, or the outstanding voting power of the Target Party, or, if applicable, any surviving entity or the parent entity resulting from any such transaction, immediately upon consummation thereof, (iii) a recapitalization of Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any transaction similar to a transaction referred to in  _clause (ii)_ involving the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any third Person or group of Persons (other than the Non-Target Party or its Affiliates) party thereto, or its stockholders, beneficially owns or would beneficially own 10% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or ordinary shares, as applicable, or the outstanding voting power of the Target Party or such Subsidiary or, if applicable, the parent entity resulting from any such transaction immediately upon consummation thereof or (iv) any transaction pursuant to which any third Person or group of Persons (other than the Non-Target Party or its Affiliates) directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, amalgamation, other business combination, partnership, joint venture or otherwise) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the equity securities of, or other ownership interest in, Subsidiaries of the Target Party and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination involving any of the Subsidiaries of the Target Party) of the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries representing 10% or more of consolidated revenues, net income, or EBITDA for the last 12 full calendar months or the fair market value of all the assets of the Target Party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no transaction involving solely the acquisition of capital stock or assets of any Allied World Subsidiary by Allied World, or of any Transatlantic Subsidiary by Transatlantic, will be deemed to be a Competing Transaction. Wherever the term "group" is used in this Agreement, it is used as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (d) The Target Party shall notify the Non-Target Party promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or request for non-public information relating to the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person that is reasonably likely to lead to or contemplate an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to the Non-Target Party shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate the identity of the Person or Persons making the Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or requesting non-public information or access to the properties, books or records of the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries, and a copy of the 

      ##### 

  

    

Acquisition Proposal or, if not in writing, a written summary in reasonable
detail of the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request or modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. The Target
Party shall (i) keep the Non-Target Party fully informed, on a current basis,
of any material changes in the status of, and any material changes or
modifications in the terms of, any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request and, if requested by the Non-Target Party, counsel for the Target
Party shall consult with counsel for the Non-Target Party once per day, at
mutually agreeable times, regarding such status and any such changes

Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any material written
material or material correspondence shall be sent or provided pursuant to
_clause (ii)_ within 24 hours after receipt or delivery thereof. Neither
Allied World nor Transatlantic shall enter into any agreement on or after
the date hereof that would prevent such party from providing any information
required by this  _Section 5.5_ to the other party. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.5_, at any time prior to obtaining the Allied World Requisite Stockholder Vote or the Transatlantic Requisite Stockholder Vote, as applicable, the Target Party may furnish or cause to be furnished information to, and enter or cause to be entered into discussions with, and only with, a Person (and its representatives) who has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited on or after the date of this Agreement and that did not otherwise result from a breach of _Section 5.5(a)_ or _Section 5.5(b)_, as applicable, if the Target Partys Board of Directors (the " _Target Board_ ") has (i) determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor or advisors) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to enter into discussions regarding the Acquisition Proposal would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) provided at least three Business Days notice to the Non-Target Party of its intent to furnish information to or enter into discussions with such Person in accordance with this  _Section 5.5(e)_, and (iii) obtained from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms that are determined in good faith by the Target Party to be substantially similar to and not less favorable to the Target Party, in the aggregate, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements shall not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such Person or having the effect of prohibiting the Target Party from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement). Unless such information has been previously provided to the Non-Target Party, all information that is provided by the Target Party to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal shall be provided to the Non-Target Party. During the three Business Day period set forth in  _clause (ii)_ , the Non-Target Party shall have the right to make a presentation to the Target Board. 

   

 (f) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a third Person (or group of Persons) (and not obtained in breach of this Agreement, including, without limitation, this _Section 5.5_) to consummate a merger, amalgamation, consolidation, business combination or other similar transaction involving the Target Party pursuant to which the stockholders of the Target Party immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock or ordinary 

      ##### 

  

    

shares, as applicable, of, or less than 50% of the outstanding voting power
of, the Target Party, any surviving entity or the parent entity resulting
from any such transaction immediately upon consummation thereof that the
Target Board (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor or advisors) determines in good faith to be more favorable
to the Target Partys stockholders than the Merger, taking into account all
relevant factors, including value and other financial considerations, legal
and regulatory considerations and any conditions to, and expected timing and
risks of, completion, as well as any changes to the terms of the
Merger proposed by the Non-Target Party in response to such Superior
Proposal. 

   

 (g) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.5(g)_, neither the Target Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the Non-Target Party) the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Target Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the Restated Articles and the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal or (C) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such actions (each such action set forth in this _Section 5.5(g)(i)_ being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) cause or permit the Target Party to enter into, or resolve, agree or propose publicly to do so with respect to, any Allied World Acquisition Agreement (in the case of Allied World) or Transatlantic Acquisition Agreement (in the case of Transatlantic) (other than a confidentiality agreement as referred to in _Section 5.5(e)_ ). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.5_, at any time prior to obtaining the Allied World Requisite Stockholder Vote (in the case of Allied World) or the Transatlantic Requisite Stockholder Vote (in the case of Transatlantic) the Target Board may, if the Target Board determines in good faith that the failure to do so would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by the Non-Target Party pursuant to this _Section 5.5(g)_, make an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Target Party may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change, unless (1) the Target Party promptly notifies the Non-Target Party in writing at least three Business Days before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of any Person making any Acquisition Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishing a copy of any relevant Allied World Acquisition Agreement (in the case of Allied World) or Transatlantic Acquisition Agreement (in the case of Transatlantic) and any other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Target Party and a new three Business Day period) and (2) prior to the expiration of such three Business Day period, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the Non-Target Party does not make a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Target Board determines in good faith to be at least as favorable as the Acquisition Proposal after giving effect to, among other things, the payment of the Termination Fee set forth in _Section 6.6_, such that the Target Board determines such action is no longer required by its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Target Party under applicable Law. During the three Business Day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Target Party shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with the Non-Target Party in good faith (to the extent the Non-Target Party seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by the Non-Target Party. The Target Party shall not 

      ##### 

  

    

submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or, except as
permitted herein, propose to do so. 

   

 (h) (i) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall prohibit the Target Party or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) no disclosure that the Allied World Board or the Transatlantic Board may determine (after consultation with counsel) that it or Allied World or Transatlantic, as applicable, is required to make under applicable Law shall constitute a violation of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any event neither the Allied World Board nor the Transatlantic Board shall make an Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with _Section 5.5(g)_. Any disclosure by the Target Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change by the Target Party, unless the Target Board reaffirms its recommendation and declaration of advisability with respect to this Agreement in such disclosure. 

   

 (i) Each of Allied World and Transatlantic and their respective Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than the other party to this Agreement) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons, other than the other party hereto, who have been furnished confidential information regarding such party in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the twelve (12) months prior to the date of this Agreement promptly to return or destroy such information. 

   

 (j) It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.5_ by any director, officer, employee, controlled Affiliate, agent or representative (including financial or legal advisor or other retained representative) of either party or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.5_ by such party.

any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by
it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;
_provided_ _further_ , that a failure to comply with this _Section 6.3(d)_
will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_
to be satisfied, unless the underlying inaccuracy or breach
would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
_Article VII_ to be satisfied. 

   

 (e) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the parties hereto, Allied World, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will adopt this Agreement.

 (a) _Allied World Credit Facilities_. Prior to the Effective Time, Allied World shall either (i) terminate the Allied World Secured Credit Facility and Allied World Unsecured Credit Facility or (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, on or before the Effective Time, the necessary consents (the " _Requisite Lender Consents_ ") of lenders party to (A) the Allied World Secured Credit Facility and (B) the Allied World Unsecured Credit Facility, in each case, to allow the Allied World Secured Credit Facility and the Allied World Unsecured Credit Facility, as applicable, to remain in effect after the Effective Time with no default or event of default thereunder resulting from the Merger or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby, with no (x) reduction of the outstanding amounts or lending or other financing commitments thereunder or (y) shortening of any maturity thereunder; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section 6.4(a)_ shall permit or require Allied World to accept any terms or conditions with respect to the Allied World Secured Credit Facility or Allied World Unsecured Credit Facility, as applicable, that are not commercially reasonable (giving effect to the then-current economic environment). If applicable, Allied World shall deliver to Transatlantic drafts of all agreements to be entered into with its lenders in connection with obtaining the Requisite Lender Consents and shall keep Transatlantic informed in all material respects of the status of Allied Worlds efforts to obtain the Requisite Lender Consents. Transatlantic shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Allied World to obtain the Requisite Lender Consents to the extent reasonably requested by Allied World.

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Allied World shall purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy for Transatlantic, the Transatlantic Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Transatlantic, in a form reasonably acceptable to Transatlantic, that shall provide Transatlantic, the Transatlantic Subsidiaries and such directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Transatlantic; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Allied World be required to expend for such policy an amount in excess of 250% of the annual aggregate premiums currently paid by Allied World for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ ").

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ will survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 (d) If Allied World or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Allied World, as the case may be, will assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_. 

    #####

the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 6.6(e)(iv)_ or _Section
6.6(f)(iv)_, as applicable, except to the extent set-off of such amounts is
permitted as indicated in the last sentence of _Section 6.6(e)_ or _Section
