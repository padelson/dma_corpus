     Section 3.02  Exchange of Certificates.  (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
                   ------------------------
Plum Creek shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to G-P as

certificates formerly representing the Timber Group Common Stock which
subsequent to the Spinoff but prior to the Effective Time evidence the Units
(each a "Certificate") for whole number of shares of Plum Creek Common Stock
into which the Units evidenced by such Certificate have been converted pursuant
to Section 3.01(a) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Plum Creek Common
Stock in accordance with Section 3.02(f).  Promptly after the Effective Time,
Plum Creek
<PAGE>

will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of
Timber Group Common Stock as of the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other customary
provisions as Plum Creek may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the whole number of
shares of Plum Creek Common Stock into which the Units have been converted and
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Plum Creek Common Stock.

     (b)  As soon as practicable but in any event no later than three Business
Days following the Effective Time, Plum Creek shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent as nominee for the benefit of the holders of Timber Group Common Stock,
certificates representing the shares of Plum Creek Common Stock (such shares of
Plum Creek Common Stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund") to be issued pursuant to Section 3.01(a). The Exchange
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Plum Creek Common
Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 3.01(a) out of the Exchange
Fund. Subject to Section 3.02(g), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purposes.

     (c)  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 3.02(a),
duly executed and completed in accordance with its terms, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a certificate
or certificates representing the whole number of shares of Plum Creek Common
Stock into which the Units represented by such Certificate have been converted
in accordance with Section 3.01(a), (ii) the amount of dividends or other
distributions, if any, with a record date on or after the Effective Time which
theretofore became payable with respect to such shares of Plum Creek Common
Stock, and (iii) the cash amount payable in lieu of fractional shares of Plum
Creek Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.02(f), in each case which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In no event
shall the holder of any Certificate be entitled to receive interest on any funds
to be received in the Mergers. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.02(c) and subject to Section 3.02(d), each Certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive the whole
number of shares of Plum Creek Common Stock into which the Units represented by
such Certificate has been converted in accordance with Section 3.01(a), plus the
cash amount payable in lieu of fractional shares of Plum Creek Common Stock in
accordance with Section 3.02(f), plus the amount of dividends or other
distributions, if any, with a record date on or after the Effective Time, which
theretofore became payable with respect to such shares of Plum Creek Common
Stock.

     (d)  No dividends or other distributions declared, made or paid after the
Effective Time with respect to shares of Plum Creek Common Stock with a record
date on
<PAGE>

or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Plum Creek Common Stock represented
thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Plum Creek Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.02(f) until the
holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this Section 3.02. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder of the certificates representing shares of Plum Creek Common Stock,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions, if any, with a record date on or after the Effective Time
which theretofore became payable, but which were not paid by reason of the
immediately preceding sentence, with respect to such shares of Plum Creek Common
Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to
such shares of Plum Creek Common Stock. Dividends or other distributions with a
record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to surrender of
Certificates by holders thereof payable in respect of shares of Plum Creek
Common Stock held by the Exchange Agent shall be held in trust for the benefit
of such holders of Certificates.

     (e)  All shares of Plum Creek Common Stock issued upon conversion of the
Units in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to
Section 3.02(d) or (f)) shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective
Time in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Units represented
thereby. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of G-P solely with
respect to the shares of Timber Group Common Stock evidencing the Units shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers thereon of such
shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 3.02.

     (f)  No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Plum Creek
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates,
and such fractional shares will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
rights of a holder of shares of Plum Creek Common Stock. In lieu of any such
fractional shares of Plum Creek Common Stock, each holder of Certificates who
would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Plum Creek Common
Stock in exchange for such Certificates (after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such holder) pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall
receive from the Exchange Agent, as applicable, a cash payment in lieu of such
fractional share of Plum Creek Common Stock, determined by multiplying (A) the
average of the per share closing sale price of Plum Creek Common Stock, as
reported on the NYSE, on each of the twenty Trading Days ending on the third
Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective Time by (B) the fractional share
of Plum Creek Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.

     (g)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Plum
<PAGE>

Creek, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore
complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Plum Creek (subject
to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) as a general creditor for
payment of their claim for shares of Plum Creek Common Stock, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Plum Creek Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of Plum Creek Common Stock. Plum Creek
shall not be liable to any holder of any Certificate for shares of Plum Creek
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
payable in respect of fractional shares of Plum Creek Common Stock, delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. Any securities or cash amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
Certificates shall immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Plum Creek free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

     (h)  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Plum Creek, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Plum Creek may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the whole number of shares of Plum Creek Common Stock into which
the Units represented by such Certificate have been converted, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Plum Creek Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and
distributions in respect of or on shares of Plum Creek Common Stock deliverable
in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

     (i)  Plum Creek shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the shares of
Plum Creek Common Stock (and any dividends or distributions thereon) and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Plum Creek Common Stock otherwise payable hereunder
to any holder of Certificates such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
Federal, state, local or foreign income tax law. To the extent that Plum Creek
so withholds those amounts, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificates
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Plum Creek.

                   -----------------

     (a)  Prior to the Effective Time, G-P shall cause each outstanding option

     (b)  Each Spinco Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately

number of Units subject to
<PAGE>

such Spinco Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest
whole number), at a price per share of Plum Creek Common Stock equal to the
per-Unit option exercise price specified in the Spinco Option divided by the
Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole cent); provided, however, that all
                                                    --------  -------
other terms and conditions of the Plum Creek Options shall continue to be
determined by reference to the applicable G-P stock plan and Timber Group
Option, provided, further, however, that all Spinco Options shall become vested
        --------  -------  -------
and exercisable as of the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, (i)
except as otherwise provided herein, all references to G-P in the Spinco Options
shall be deemed to refer to Plum Creek and (ii) no Plum Creek Option holder
shall be deemed to have suffered a termination of employment under such plans or
agreements solely by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder.

     (c)  In respect of those Plum Creek Option holders who do not become
employees of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time ("Non-Plum Creek
Optionees"), (i) any references in the Plum Creek Option to G-P as the employer
of Non-Plum Creek Optionees or to employment by Non-Plum Creek Optionees by G-P
shall not be deemed to refer to Plum Creek as the employer or to employment with
Plum Creek and (ii) G-P shall provide Plum Creek, in a timely manner, with such
information as Plum Creek shall reasonably require in order to assume its
obligations and enforce its rights under the Plum Creek Options.

     (d)  Plum Creek shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Plum Creek Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of the Plum Creek Options. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Plum Creek shall issue to each holder of a Spinco
Option that was converted into a Plum Creek Option pursuant to this Section 3.03
a document evidencing the foregoing assumption by Plum Creek. At or prior to the

                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF G-P

     Except as otherwise set forth in the G-P Disclosure Letter specifying the
section to which it relates, G-P hereby represents and warrants to Plum Creek as
follows:

     Section 4.01  Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power. Each of
                   ---------------------------------------------------

each such Person has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.
Each of G-P and the Spincos is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Timber Group Material Adverse Effect.
Section 4.01 of the letter delivered by G-P to Plum Creek concurrently with the
delivery of this Agreement (the "G-P Disclosure Letter") sets forth a list of
all of the Persons holding as of the date hereof, directly or indirectly, any of
the assets and liabilities of the Timber Group and their respective
jurisdictions of incorporation or organization and identifies G-P's (direct or
indirect) percentage of equity ownership therein.

the Spincos has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Separation Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Separation
Agreement by each of G-P and the Spincos, and the consummation by each of them
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized
and unanimously approved by their respective Boards of Directors and by G-P as
the sole stockholder of each of the Spincos and no other
<PAGE>

corporate action on the part of G-P or any of the Spincos is necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Separation Agreement by G-P or the Spincos and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and the Separation
Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by each of G-P and the Spincos
and each is a valid and binding obligation of each of G-P and the Spincos
enforceable against each of G-P and the Spincos in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent that its enforceability may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable
principles.

from the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, rights of payment and reimbursement, terminations, modifications,

     Section 4.05  G-P SEC Filings; Financial Statements.
                   -------------------------------------

     (a)  G-P has timely filed all registration statements, prospectuses, forms,
reports and documents and related exhibits required to be filed by it under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since November 1, 1997
(collectively, the "G-P SEC Filings"). The G-P SEC Filings (i) as they relate to
the Timber Group, were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
(ii) did not at the time they were filed contain any untrue statement of a
material fact with respect to the Timber Group or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein with respect to the Timber Group, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. No liabilities attributable to the
Georgia-Pacific Group as set forth in the G-P SEC Filings are attributable to
the Timber Group. No G-P Subsidiary is subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act.

     (b)  Each of the Timber Group Financial Statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) contained in the G-P SEC Filings was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except with
respect to unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act
and to normal and recurring adjustments) and each presented fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Timber Group as of
the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein,
except as otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to normal and recurring year-end adjustments). The books and records of each of
G-P, the Spincos and their Subsidiaries as they relate to the Timber Group have
been, and are being, maintained in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable
legal and accounting requirements.

     Section 4.06  No Undisclosed Liabilities.  Except as and to the extent
                   --------------------------
set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of the Timber Group, as of 2000,
including the notes thereto, neither G-P, any of the Spincos nor any
Subsidiaries of G-P has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) relating to the Timber Group that
would be required to be reflected on a balance sheet or in the notes thereto
prepared in
<PAGE>

accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities or obligations incurred since April
1, 2000 in the ordinary course of business that would neither, individually or
in the aggregate, (i) reasonably be expected to have a Timber Group Material
Adverse Effect nor (ii) reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the performance by G-P of its obligations under this Agreement, each Merger or
the transactions contemplated thereby.

     Section 4.07  Information to Be Supplied.
                   --------------------------

     (a)  The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the other documents required
to be filed by G-P with the SEC in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case
may be, and will not, on the date that it is filed, on the date it is first
mailed to the shareholders of Timber Group Common Stock and stockholders of Plum
Creek and at the time of the Timber Group Shareholder Meeting and the Plum Creek
Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

     (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.07, no
representation or warranty is made by G-P with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Merger Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied by Plum Creek expressly
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein or based on information
which is not made in or incorporated by reference in such documents but which
should have been disclosed pursuant to Section 5.07.

     Section 4.08  Absence of Certain Events. Except as expressly permitted by
                   -------------------------
this Agreement, since January 1, 2000, each of G-P, the Spincos and their
Subsidiaries have operated their respective Timber Group businesses only in the
ordinary course of business and there has not occurred (i) any event, occurrence
or condition which would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Timber Group Material Adverse Effect or (ii) other than in the
ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with past practices, any
increase in the compensation of, or change of control agreement with, any
officer of G-P, the Spincos or any of their Subsidiaries or any general salary
or benefits increase to the employees of G-P, the Spincos or any of their
Subsidiaries, except those employees that will not be Timber Group Employees.

                   ----------
Disclosure Letter, there are no investigations, actions, suits or proceedings
pending against G-P, the Spincos or any of their Subsidiaries or, to the
knowledge of G-P, threatened against G-P, the Spincos or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective properties, rights or franchises), at
law or in equity, or before or by any Federal or state commission, board,
bureau, agency, regulatory or administrative instrumentality or other
Governmental Authority or any arbitrator or arbitration tribunal, that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Timber Group
Material Adverse Effect, and, to the knowledge of G-P, no development has
occurred with respect to any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding
that would reasonably be expected to have a Timber Group Material Adverse Effect
or would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impair or
<PAGE>

materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Neither G-P, any of the Spincos nor their Subsidiaries is subject to any
judgment, order or decree entered in any lawsuit or proceeding which would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Timber Group
Material Adverse Effect.

                   ---------------------------------
Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete list of all of the material Timber Group
Real Property. Except as set forth in Section 4.10 of the G-P Disclosure Letter,
each of G-P, the Spincos and their Subsidiaries has good, valid and marketable
title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold
interests in, all tangible properties and assets of the Timber Group except
where the failure to have such good, valid and marketable title would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Timber Group
Material Adverse Effect; in each case subject to no Liens, except for (a) Liens
reflected in G-P's consolidated balance sheet as of April 1, 2000, (b) Liens
consisting of zoning or planning restrictions, easements, permits and other
restrictions or limitations on the use of real property or irregularities in
title thereto which do not materially detract from the value of, or impair the
use of, such property by G-P, any of the Spincos or any of their Subsidiaries in
the operation of the Timber Group, (c) Liens for current Taxes, assessments or
governmental charges or levies on property not yet due or which are being
contested in good faith and for which appropriate reserves in accordance with
GAAP have been created and (d) Liens which would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Timber Group Material Adverse Effect.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Timber Group Material Adverse Effect, each of G-P, the Spincos and their
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of all leases of tangible
properties to which they are a party and under which they are in occupancy that
relate to the operation of the Timber Group, and all such leases are in full
force and effect.

     Section 4.11  Compliance with Laws.
                   --------------------

     (a)  Each of G-P, the Spincos and their Subsidiaries are in compliance with
all applicable Federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations,
orders, judgments and decrees except where the failure to so comply would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Timber Group
Material Adverse Effect.

     (b)  Except as set forth in Section 4.11(b) of the G-P Disclosure Letter,
each of G-P, the Spincos and their Subsidiaries hold, to the extent legally
required, all Federal, state, local and foreign permits, approvals, licenses,
authorizations, certificates, rights, exemptions and orders from Governmental
Authorities (the "Permits") that are required for the operation of the Timber
Group by G-P, the Spincos and their Subsidiaries as now conducted, except where
the failure to hold any such Permit would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Timber Group Material Adverse Effect,
and there has not occurred any default under any such Permit, except to the
extent that such default would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Timber Group Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 4.12  G-P Employee Benefit Plans.  Except as would not pertain
                   --------------------------
to or materially affect the Timber Group:
<PAGE>

     (a)  Section 4.12(a) of the G-P Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of each employment, bonus, deferred compensation, incentive
compensation, stock purchase, stock option, stock appreciation right or other
stock-based incentive, severance, change-in-control, or termination pay,
hospitalization or other medical, disability, life or other insurance,
supplemental unemployment benefits, profit-sharing, pension, or retirement plan,
program, agreement or arrangement and each other employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to
be contributed to by G-P, the Spincos or any of their subsidiaries, or by any
trade or business, whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"), that
together with G-P or any of its subsidiaries would be deemed a "single employer"
within the meaning of Section 4001(b)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), for the benefit of any current or former
employee or director of a Spinco or any Spinco subsidiary, whether formal or
informal and whether legally binding or not (the "Spinco Plans").

     (b)  With respect to each Spinco Plan, G-P has made available or will make
available to Plum Creek a current, accurate and complete copy thereof and, to
the extent applicable: (i) the most recent determination letter, (ii) any
summary plan description and (iii) for the two most recent years (A) the form
5500 and attached schedules, (B) audited financial statements and (C) actuarial
valuation reports.

     (c)  The Spinco Plans are in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code, and other applicable laws and have
been administered in accordance with their terms and such laws, except where the
failure to so comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Timber Group
Material Adverse Effect. Each Spinco Plan which is intended to be qualified
within the meaning of Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter as to its qualification, and, to the knowledge of G-P,
nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to affect such
qualification.

     (d)  There are no pending, or to the knowledge of G-P, threatened claims
and no pending or, to the knowledge of the Spincos, threatened litigation with
respect to any Spincos Plans that would reasonably be expected to have a Timber
Group Material Adverse Effect, other than ordinary and usual claims for benefits
by participants and beneficiaries.

     (e)  No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by G-P, any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate since the Effective Date of ERISA that
has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material
risk to G-P, the Spincos or any of their subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of
incurring any liability under such Title, other than liability for premiums due
to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC"), which payments have been
or will be made when due, that would reasonably be expected to have a Timber
Group Material Adverse Effect. G-P shall take such steps as are necessary to
prevent Spinco assets from being subject to a lien as a result of any liability
G-P or any ERISA Affiliate may incur under Title IV of ERISA. To the extent this
representation applies to Sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, it
is made not
<PAGE>

only with respect to the Plans but also with respect to any employee benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which G-
P, the Spincos, any of their subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was
required to make, contributions during the past six years.

     (f)  No lien has been imposed under section 412(n) of the Code or Section
302(f) of ERISA on the assets of G-P, any of the Spincos, any of their
subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, and no event or circumstance has occurred
that is reasonably likely to result in the imposition of any such lien on any
such assets on account of any Spinco Plan.

     (g)  Except for liabilities that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Timber Group Material Adverse Effect, with respect to any Spinco Plan that is a
"multiemployer pension plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
(i) neither G-P, any of its subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has, since
September 26, 1980, made or suffered a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial
withdrawal," (as such terms are respectively defined in Sections 4203 and 4205
of ERISA) pursuant to which all liability in respect thereof has not been
satisfied, (ii) no event (including the transactions contemplated hereunder) is
reasonably expected to occur that presents a material risk of a complete or
partial withdrawal, and (iii) neither G-P, the Spincos, each of their
subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has any contingent material liability under
Section 4204 of ERISA.

     Section 4.13  Employment Relations.
                   --------------------

     (a)  Except as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Timber Group Material Adverse Effect or as set forth in
Section 4.13(a) of the G-P Disclosure Letter, (i) neither G-P, the Spincos or
any Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor
union contract with respect to any employee of the Timber Group, (ii) there are
no organizational campaigns, demands or proceedings pending or, to G-P's
knowledge, threatened by any labor organization or group of employees seeking
recognition or certification as collective bargaining representatives of any
group of employees of the Timber Group, and (iii) there are no strikes,
controversies, slowdowns, work stoppages or material labor disputes, or, to G-
P's knowledge, threatened involving any site of employment of the Timber Group.

the Timber Group as of the date hereof is attached as Exhibit 2.1(b) to the
Human Resources Agreement.

     (b)  Except as would not pertain to or affect the Timber Group or as set
forth in the G-P Disclosure Letter, each of G-P and its Subsidiaries is, and has
at all times been, in material compliance with all applicable laws respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages,
hours of work and occupational safety and health, and is not engaged in any
unfair labor practices as defined in the National Labor Relations Act or other
applicable law, ordinance or regulation. Except as set forth in Section 4.09 of
the Gulf Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of G-P, there are no complaints,
controversies, charges, investigations, lawsuits or other proceedings relating
to the Timber Group pending in any court or with any agency responsible for the
enforcement
<PAGE>

of Federal, state, local or foreign labor or employment laws regarding breach of
any express or implied contract or employment, any law or regulation governing
employment or the termination thereof or other discriminatory, wrongful or
tortious conduct in connection with the employment relationship.

     (c)  Except as would not pertain to or affect the Timber Group, since
January 1, 2000, neither G-P nor any of its Subsidiaries has effectuated (i) a
"plant closing" as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act of 1988 (the "WARN Act") affecting any site of employment or one or more
facilities or operating units within any site of employment or facility of G-P
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act)
affecting any site of employment or facility of G-P or any of its Subsidiaries;
nor has G-P nor any of its Subsidiaries been affected by any transaction or
engaged in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger
application of any similar state or local law.

                   -----
the G-P Disclosure Letter:

     (a)  G-P and each of its Subsidiaries and each of its Affiliated Entities:

          (i)   have timely paid or caused to be paid all material Taxes
required to be paid by it. The accruals for Taxes payable in G-P's most recent
consolidated financial statements are adequate to cover all material Taxes
attributable to periods (or portions thereof) ending on the date of such
financial statements, and no material Taxes attributable to periods following
the date of such financial statements have been incurred other than in the
ordinary course of business;

          (ii)  have filed or caused to be filed in a timely manner all material
Tax Returns required to be filed by such entities with the appropriate Tax

Group, that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act.

                     ------------------

Disclosure Letter, neither G-P, any of the Spincos nor any of their Subsidiaries
is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding
(whether written or oral), (a) as of the date hereof, which is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the
SEC) pertaining to or affecting in any material respect the Timber Group, which
requires expenditures or the performance of services in an amount in excess of
$5 million and is not cancellable within one year, that has not been filed or
incorporated by reference in the G-P SEC Filings, (b) which contains any
material non-compete provisions with respect to any line of business or
geographic area in which the Timber Group business is conducted or which
restricts the conduct of G-P, any of the Spincos or any of their Subsidiaries
with respect to any Timber Group business conducted by G-P, any of the Spincos
or any of their Subsidiaries or any geographic area in which G-P, any of the
Spincos or any of their Subsidiaries may conduct Timber Group business, in each
case in any material respect, or (c) which would prohibit or materially delay
the consummation of the Mergers or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type
described in this Section 4.23, whether or not set forth in Section 4.23 of the
G-P Disclosure Letter, is referred to herein as a "Timber Group Material
Contract." Each Timber Group Material Contract is valid and binding on G-P, the

<PAGE>

effect, and G-P, the Spincos and their Subsidiaries have in all material
respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them to date
individually or in the aggregate, except for violations or defaults that would
not reasonably be expected to have a Timber Group Material Adverse Effect.
Neither G-P, any of the Spincos nor any of their Subsidiaries knows of, or has
received notice of, any violation or default under (nor to their knowledge does
there exist any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice
would cause such a violation of or default under) any Timber Group Material
Contract or any other Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its properties or assets is bound, except for violations or defaults that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Timber
Group Material Adverse Effect.

     Section  4.24   Redemption.  Upon completion of the Redemption, the Spincos
                     ----------
collectively will hold all of the assets and have assumed all of the liabilities
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) attributed to the Timber
Group. As of July 1, 2000, the aggregate outstanding indebtedness attributed to
the Timber Group was $1.027 billion. Between July 1, 2000 and the date hereof,
G-P and its Subsidiaries have incurred no indebtedness for borrowed money
attributable to the Timber Group other than borrowings in the ordinary course of
business.

     Section  4.25   Policies with Respect to Allocation of Expenses. G-P has
                     -----------------------------------------------
provided Plum Creek with a copy of Expenses all written management and
allocation policies adopted by the G-P Board of Directors since November 1, 1997
and a summary of the methodology used in implementing those policies (the
"Allocation Policies").

     Section  4.26   Disclosure. No representation or warranty by G-P contained
                     ----------
in this Agreement and no statement contained in any document (including
financial statements and the G-P Disclosure Letter), certificate, or other
writing furnished or to be furnished by G-P to Plum Creek or any of its
representatives pursuant to the provisions hereof or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, contains or will contain
any untrue statement of material fact or omits or will omit to state any
material fact necessary, in light of the circumstances under which it was made,
in order to make the statements herein or therein not misleading.

     Section  4.27   Broker's or Finder's Fee. Except for the fees of Morgan
                     ------------------------
Stanley & Co. Incorporated, no agent, broker, Person or firm acting on behalf of
G-P is, or will be, entitled to any investment banking or broker's or finder's
fees from any of the parties hereto, or from any Person controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with any of the parties hereto, in connection with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. G-P has provided
Plum Creek a copy of the Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated engagement letter
with G-P and such engagement letter will not be amended without the consent of
Plum Creek.

     Section  4.28   Solvency. (a) The consummation of the transactions
                     --------
contemplated hereby will not cause G-P to be unable to pay its debts as they
come due in the usual course of business or cause its total assets to become
less than the sum of its total liabilities in accordance with Section 14-2-640
of the GCC.

     (a)  G-P shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Solvency Opinions.
<PAGE>

     Section  4.29   Installment Note.  On or about June 24, 2000, if the
                     ----------------
installment note received in connection with the sale of the Fort Bragg
timberlands (the "Fort Bragg Note") were to be monetized at that point in time
based upon the then existing facts and circumstances, G-P believes that the
proceeds from such monetization would have been not less than $350 million, and
the interest earned on the Fort Bragg Notes would have been greater than or
equal to the interest paid on the note issued in such monetization.

Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable

Creek's Subsidiaries or any significant portion of the assets or securities of
Plum Creek or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, tender offer or other similar transaction or (ii) Plum Creek's Board

engaged outside legal counsel) determines in good faith that furnishing such

P or Plum Creek, as the case may be, in response to G-P Bona Fide Proposal or a
Plum Creek Bona Fide Proposal, from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making any disclosure to G-P shareholders or Plum Creek shareholders, as
the case may be, if, in the good faith judgment (based on the advise of outside
counsel) of the Board of Directors of G-P or Plum Creek, as the case may be,
failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable law.

correct except as would not be reasonably expected to have a G-P Material
Adverse Effect, in each case, when made and at the Notice of Redemption Date as
if made again at that time (except to the extent that any representation or
warranty speaks as of an earlier date, in which case it must be true and correct
only as of that earlier date);

Redemption Date, to the effect that (i) the Mergers will be treated for Federal
income tax purposes as reorganizations qualifying under the provisions of
section 368(a) of the Code, and Plum Creek and the Spincos will each be a party
to a reorganization, and (ii) after the Mergers, the Surviving Corporation will

deemed to be satisfied or waived with respect to the Mergers):

this Agreement that are qualified as to materiality must be true and correct in
all respects and those representations and warranties not so qualified must be
true and correct in all material respects, in each case, when made and at the

counsel to G-P, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to G-P, based upon

certifying that as of the Effective Date, all conditions set forth in Section
