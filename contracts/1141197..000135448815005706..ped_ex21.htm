regulations, except where such noncompliance has and will have, in the
aggregate, no Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

  

(2) As of the Execution Date, Parent has not received notice of any
noncompliance with the foregoing Section (1), nor to its Knowledge are there
any claims or threatened claims in connection therewith. Parent has never
conducted any material operations or engaged in any material business
transactions whatsoever other than as set forth in the reports Parent has
previously filed with the SEC.

  

  

(3) Assuming all corporate consents and approvals have been obtained
(including the Parent Required Approvals) and assuming all applicable
appropriate filings and mailings are made by Parent under the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, with the NYSE MKT, and with the Secretary of State of
Delaware, the execution and delivery by Parent of this Agreement and the
closing documents and the consummation by Parent of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) require the consent, approval or
action of, or any filing or notice to, any corporation, firm, Person or other
entity or any public, Governmental Entity or judicial authority (except for
such consents, approvals, actions, filing or notices the failure of which to
make or obtain will not in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent); or (ii) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment,
ruling, law, rule or regulation of any federal, state, county, municipal, or
foreign court or Governmental Entity or authority applicable to Parent, or its
business or assets. Parent is not subject to, or a party to, any mortgage,
lien, lease, agreement, contract, instrument, order, judgment or decree or any
other material restriction of any kind or character which would prevent,
hinder, restrict or impair the continued operation of the business of Parent
(or to the Knowledge of Parent, the continued operation of the business of the
Company) after the Closing.

  

  

(j) Ongoing Business. No aspect of Parent's past or present business,
operations or assets is of such a character as would restrict or otherwise
hinder or impair Parent from carrying on the business of Parent as it is
presently being conducted by Parent.

  

  

(k) Required Government Consents, Filings, etc. Except as have been or, prior
to the Closing, will be obtained, no approval, authorization, certification,
consent, variance, permission, license, or permit to or from, or notice,
filing, or recording to or with, any U.S. Federal, state, or local
governmental authorities is necessary for the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other agreements and instruments to be executed and
delivered by Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
or the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(l) Other Required Consents, Filings, etc. Except as have been or, prior to
the Closing, will be obtained, no approval, authorization, consent,
permission, or waiver to or from, or notice, filing, or recording to or with,

the other agreements and instruments to be executed and delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby by Parent, or the
consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(m) Title to Assets. Parent has good and marketable title to all tangible
personal property owned by it which is material to the business of Parent.
Parent does not own

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

any real property in fee simple, except for interests in oil or gas properties
that may be deemed real property under applicable law. Except as disclosed in
Section 4(m) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent has defensible title to
the Real Property interests held by it, in each case free and clear of all
liens and claims arising by, through or under Parent, but not otherwise, but
subject to and burdened by the Real Property Encumbrances.

  

  

(n) Parent Oil and Gas Properties. Parent has defensible title to all Parent
Oil and Gas Properties (as such term is defined below) forming the basis for
the reserves reflected in Parent financial statements as attributable to
interests owned by Parent, except for those defects in title that do not have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent, and are free and clear of all liens,
except for liens associated with obligations reflected in Parent financial
statements. The oil and gas leases and other agreements that provide Parent
with operating rights in the Parent Oil and Gas Properties are legal, valid
and binding and in full force and effect, and the rentals, royalties and other
payments due thereunder have been properly and timely paid, and there is no
existing default (or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default) under any of such oil and gas leases or other agreements,
except, in each case, as individually or in the aggregate has not had, and
would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Parent.

  

  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Oil and Gas Properties" means all of
the Parent's and any of its Subsidiaries' right, title and interest in, to and
under, or derived from oil and gas leases, licenses, authorities to prospect
and rights, wells and units, including all land, facilities, personal property
and equipment, contracts and information pertaining or relating thereto.

  

  

(o) Compliance with Rules.

applicable to Parent and/or its business, except where such failure to comply
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or its operations. "Rule"
means any law, statute, rule, regulation, order, court decision, judgment or
decree of any U.S. Federal, state, territorial, provincial or municipal
authority.

  

  

(2) Parent is in material compliance with, and has obtained all Permits and
other authorizations relating to Parent or Merger Sub which are required by
any Rule, which has been enacted to the date of this Agreement, except as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub or its
operations. No governmental proceeding is pending or threatened to cancel,
amend, modify or fail to renew any such Permit. "Permit" includes any
approval, authorization, concession, grant, certificate of convenience and
necessity, qualification, consent, franchise, license, security clearance,
easement, order or other permit issued or granted by any Governmental Entity.

  

  

(x) Brokers and Finders. The Parent and Merger Sub have not entered into any
contract with any person that may result in the obligation of the Parent or
Merger Sub to pay any investment banking fees, finder's fees or brokerage fees
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

entry into this Agreement were (a) accurate and complete when provided and as
of the date of this Agreement; and (b) did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact, or omit to include any material fact necessary to make the

Agreement or the Parent Disclosure Documents and no statement contained in any
certificate, schedule or other communication furnished pursuant to or in
connection with the provisions hereof contains or shall contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading. There is no current or
prior event or condition of any kind or character pertaining to Parent that
may reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except
as specifically indicated elsewhere in this Agreement, all documents delivered
by Parent in connection herewith have been and will be complete originals, or
exact copies thereof.

  

  

(q) Environmental Matters. Parent, including any corporation to which Parent
is a successor, is in material compliance with all Environmental Laws. Neither
Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other Person for whose conduct
Parent is or may be held responsible, has any material violation of any
Environmental Law, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, with respect to any
properties and assets (whether real, personal or mixed) in which Parent (or
any predecessor) has or had an interest, or at any property geologically or
hydrologically adjoining any such property or assets.

operations of such party, unless such information (i) is readily ascertainable
from public or published information, (ii) is received from a third party not
under any obligation to keep such information confidential, or (iii) is
required to be disclosed by any law or order (in which case the disclosing
party shall promptly provide notice thereof to the other party in order to

disclosure). If the Merger is not consummated for any reason, each party shall
return to the other all such confidential information, including notes and
compilations thereof, promptly after the date of such termination. The

recapitalization, or exchange of shares with respect to or rights, options or
warrants issued in respect of Parent Common Stock or Parent Series A Preferred
Stock after the date hereof and there shall be no dividends or other
distributions paid on Parent's Common Stock after the date hereof, in each
