 _Exchange of Certificates_

 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the
Company or on the part of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Other than the Shares owned by (i) Parent, Merger
Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, and in
each case not held on behalf of third parties, (ii) the Company or any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held
on behalf of third parties, and (iii) holders of Shares who have perfected and
not withdrawn a demand for (or otherwise lost their right to) appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ,"
such holders, " _Dissenting Stockholders_ " and each Dissenting Share and each
Share referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section
4.1(a), an " _Excluded Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_
"), each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such Shares, the " _Eligible Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to
receive $45.25 per Share in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ "), and shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and (A) each certificate formerly representing any of
the Eligible Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ "), and (B) each book-entry
account formerly representing any non-certificated Eligible Shares (each, a "
_Book-Entry Share_ "), shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Each (i) Excluded Share that is a
Dissenting Share shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any
rights the holders thereof may have pursuant to Section 4.2(f) with respect
to any Dissenting Shares, (ii) each Excluded Share of the type referred to in
Section 4.1(a)(i) shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist, and (iii) each Excluded Share of the type
referred to in Section 4.1(a)(ii) shall automatically be converted into such
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation so as to
maintain the same relative ownership percentages.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2.  _Exchange of Certificates and Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration and Paying Agent_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with a paying agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (such acceptance not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), an amount in cash in immediately available
funds sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the
Paying Agent to make payments in respect of the Eligible Shares pursuant to
Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ").

 

(ii) The agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent
(the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company (such acceptance not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed). Pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement, among other
things, the Paying Agent shall (A) act as the paying agent for the payment
and delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration and (B) invest the Exchange
Fund, if and as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, any investment shall be
in obligations of or guaranteed as to

 



-4-  principal and interest by the U.S. government, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Financial Services LLC, respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available), or in money market
funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination
of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding three months. To the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall
promptly replace or restore or cause the replacement or restoration of the
cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as
to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to make such cash payments. Subject to the terms of the Paying
Agent Agreement, any interest and other income resulting from such investment
(if any) shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts (if any) in
excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as requested by Parent.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation (with
the assistance of Parent if necessary) shall cause the Paying Agent to provide
or make available to each holder of record of Eligible Shares that are (A)
represented by Certificates or (B) Book-Entry Shares not held through The
Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") notice advising such holders of the
effectiveness of the Merger, which notice shall include (I) appropriate
transmittal materials (including a customary letter of
transmittal) specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares shall pass only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates, as provided in Section 4.2(e)) or the surrender of such Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent (which is deemed to have been effected upon
the delivery of a customary "agents message" with respect to such Book-Entry
Shares or such other evidence reasonably acceptable to Parent or the Paying
Agent, of such surrender), as applicable, such materials to be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent desires and are reasonably acceptable
to the Company (such acceptance not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld
or delayed) and (II) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided
in Section 4.2(e)) or the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in exchange
for the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a).

 

(ii) With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent, DTC
and such other necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries to ensure
that the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three
Business Days thereafter), upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record
by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary surrender procedures
and such other procedures as agreed by Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent,
DTC and such other necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries, the Per
Share Merger Consideration, to which the beneficial owners thereof are
entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



-5- (iii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Eligible Shares that (A) are
represented by Certificates, by physical surrender of such Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in Section 4.2(e))
together with the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of the materials and instructions provided by the
Paying Agent, (B) are Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC, by book-receipt
of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent in connection with the surrender
of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of surrender with
respect to such Book-Entry Shares), in each case pursuant to such materials
and instructions as contemplated by Section 4.2(b)(i), and (C) are Book-Entry
Shares held through DTC, in accordance with DTCs customary surrender
procedures and such other procedures as agreed by the Company, Parent, the
Paying Agent, DTC and such other necessary or desirable third-party
intermediaries pursuant to Section 4.2(b)(ii), the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly
as reasonably practicable to such holders, an amount in cash in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the product obtained by __multiplying__
 (I) the number of Eligible Shares represented by such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in Section 4.2(e))
or such Book-Entry Shares by (II) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, no interest will be paid or accrued for the
benefit of any holder of Eligible Shares on any amount payable upon the
surrender of any Eligible Shares as contemplated by the foregoing provisions
of this Section 4.2(b), and any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be cancelled by the Paying Agent. Payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration upon surrender of an Eligible Share to which such
Eligible Share is entitled pursuant to Section 4.1(a) will be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Eligible
Share.

 

(v) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any Eligible Shares that is not
registered in the stock transfer books of the Company or if the consideration
payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, a check for any cash to
be exchanged upon due surrender of any such Certificate or Certificates may
be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate or Certificates formerly
representing such Eligible Shares is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for surrender and presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp or registration Taxes
or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in
form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent.
Payment of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the Company.

 



-6- (vi) Subject to the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, Parent, in the
exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all
determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing
the validity of any such transmittal materials described herein and compliance
by any holder of Shares with the procedures contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Eligible Shares.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or acceptable evidence of a
Book-Entry Share formerly representing any Eligible Shares is presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to
which the holder thereof is entitled in accordance with this Article IV.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof (if any)) that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Shares for one year from and after the Closing
Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Eligible
Shares who has not theretofore complied with the procedures, materials and
instructions contemplated by this Article IV shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.2(g)) payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a) and Section 4.2(b).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. Any Per Share Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof designated by the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
representing Eligible Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as
may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the product
obtained by __multiplying__ (i) the number of Eligible Shares represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate by (ii) the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise
lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by
such Dissenting Stockholder and such Dissenting Stockholder shall cease to
have any other rights with respect to such Shares. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost 

 



-7-  the right under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting
Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall become Eligible Shares and shall
thereupon be deemed to have converted, at the Effective Time, into the right
to receive the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to such
Shares pursuant to this Article IV. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice and copies of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals or
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to the
Companys stockholders demands of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to any demand for
appraisal under the DGCL, including any determination to make any payment to
any of the Dissenting Stockholders with respect to any of their Dissenting
Shares under Section 262(h) of the DGCL prior to the entry of judgment in the
appraisal Proceedings. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisals, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(g)  _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Parent, the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation (and
any of their Affiliates) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) shall be
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

4.3.  _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options and Company SARs_. Except as otherwise
agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of
any Company Options or Company SARs (each, whether or not vested, a " _Company

Awards, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Exercisable
Award shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to represent an option or stock appreciation right, as
applicable, to purchase Shares, be cancelled and converted into only the
right to receive as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, without interest, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
__multiplying__ (i) the number of Shares subject to such Company Exercisable
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under
such Company Exercisable Award, __less__ applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment (such payment, the " _Company
Exercisable Award Consideration_ "). The Company Exercisable Award
Consideration shall be fully vested as of the Effective Time and shall be paid
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Company Exercisable Award that has a per Share
exercise price that is greater than or equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration,
payment or right to consideration or payment.

 



-8- (b) _Company Restricted Share Awards_. Except as otherwise agreed to in
writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of any Company
Restricted Share Awards with respect to such holders Company Restricted Share
Awards, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted
share award (a " _Company Restricted Share Award_ ") under the Stock Plans
shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into and the holder thereof shall only be entitled
to receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by __multiplying__ (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
Restricted Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Per
Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment (the " _Company Restricted Share Award
Consideration_ "). The Company Restricted Share Award Consideration shall be
fully vested as of the Effective Time and shall be paid as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time.

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Except as otherwise agreed to in
writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of any Company RSU
Awards with respect to such holders Company RSU Awards, immediately prior to

any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into,
and the holder thereof shall only be entitled to the right to receive the
following:

(i) with respect to each Company Cashed Out RSU Award, without interest, an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by __multiplying__ (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration (the " _Company RSU
Award Consideration_ "), which Company RSU Award Consideration shall be fully
vested as of the Effective Time and shall be paid as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time; provided that with respect to any
Company Cashed Out RSU Awards that constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company RSU Award
Consideration will be paid at the earliest time permitted under the applicable
Stock Plan, award agreement or Benefit Plan that will not trigger a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code;

(ii) with respect to each Company Pre-2018 RSU Award and Company 2018
Employee RSU Award, the Company RSU Award Consideration, which Company RSU
Award Consideration shall remain subject to the same vesting schedule and
other relevant payment terms and conditions (including continued service)
applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time to the Company Pre-2018 RSU
Award or Company 2018 Employee RSU Award to which such payment relates,
and which will be paid no later than three Business Days after the applicable
vesting date of such former Company Pre-2018 RSU Award or Company 2018
Employee RSU Award; _provided_ that with respect to any Company Pre-2018 RSU
Awards and Company 2018 Employee RSU Awards that constitute nonqualified
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company RSU
Award Consideration will be paid at the earliest time permitted under the
applicable Stock Plan, award agreement or Benefit Plan that will not trigger a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code; and

 



-9- (iii) with respect to each Company 2018 VP RSU Award, a Parent restricted
stock unit award with respect to the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Capital Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares subject to such
Company 2018 VP RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up or down to the nearest whole unit (a " _Converted
RSU Award_ "), which Converted RSU Award shall remain subject to the same
vesting schedule and other terms and conditions (including continued service)
applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time to the Company 2018 VP RSU
Award to which such payment relates.

(iv) _Treatment of Performance Shares Awards_. Except as otherwise agreed to
in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of any Company
Performance Share Awards with respect to such holders Company Performance
Share Award, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding

Stock Plans shall automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and the holder thereof shall
only be entitled to the right to receive, without interest, an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by __multiplying__ (i) the total number of
Shares subject to such Company Performance Share Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time (based on (x) the target level of performance with
respect to each such Company Performance Share Award for which the applicable
performance year has not been completed prior to the Effective Time (or, if so
completed, with respect to which the level of performance achieved has not
yet been determined) and (y) the actual level of performance achieved for all
other outstanding Company Performance Share Awards) by (ii) the Per Share
Merger Consideration (the " _Company Performance Share Award Consideration_
")). The Company Performance Share Award Consideration shall be fully vested
as of the Effective Time and shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable

Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

Awards, Company Pre-2018 RSU Awards, Company 2018 Employee RSU Awards or
Company Performance Share Awards becomes entitled pursuant to Sections 4.3(a)

otherwise determined by Parent, through the Surviving Corporations payroll.
Company 2018 VP RSU Awards converted into Converted RSU Awards shall be
settled for Parent Capital Stock no later than three Business Days after the
applicable vesting date, and the award agreements governing each such

market value equal to the amount of such Tax obligations.

thereunder may not increase their elections with respect to the offering

outstanding offering periods under the Company ESPPs shall terminate and the
Company shall distribute to each participant in a Company ESPP all Company
Common Stock purchased pursuant to such offering period and all of his or her
remaining accumulated payroll deductions with respect to such offering period.

Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date hereof to the earlier of the
Effective Time and termination in accordance with Article IX, the issued and
outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or securities or a different class by reason of any reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender offer or exchange offer, or other
similar transaction, or a stock dividend with a record date within such
period shall have been declared, then the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, and as so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger

Kroger Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive

to such Kroger Warrant as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that if the Kroger Warrant has an exercise price per Share that

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject only to adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to
vote on such matter at a stockholders meeting duly called and held for such
purpose (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with

reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles (the "

(other than Parent, Merger Sub and any of Parents other direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries) of Shares, a copy of which opinion has been
delivered to Parent. It is understood and agreed that such opinion is for the
benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger
Sub. The Company Board has taken all action so that Parent will not be an
"interested stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a
"business combination" with the Company (in each case, as such term is used in

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in
connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of immediately following the Effective Time, except those
that the failure to give, make or obtain would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or

creation or acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien,
other than any Permitted Lien, on any of the properties, rights or assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Material Contract
binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with
respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement), compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 5.4(a), under any applicable Law or Privacy
Policy to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except,
in the case of clause (ii) directly above, for any such breach, violation,
termination, cancellation, default, creation or acceleration that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay or impair the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all

any liability under, a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" (as defined in Section
400(a)(15) of ERISA).

 



-25- (g) Except as required by applicable Law, no Benefit Plan provides retiree or
post-employment medical, disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits
to any Person, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligation to provide such benefits. To the extent that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries sponsors such plans, the Company or the applicable
Subsidiaries has reserved the right to amend, terminate or modify any such
plan at any time.

(h) Each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) is in documentary compliance
with, and has been operated and administered in compliance with, Section 409A
of the Code and the guidance issued by the IRS provided thereunder.

(i) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement, stockholder adoption or other approval of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
could, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, director, officer or independent contractor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any material
increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
materially increase the amount of compensation due to any such employee,
director, officer, or independent contractor or (iii) directly or indirectly
cause the Company to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any payments or
benefits under any Benefit Plan.

 

(j) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement,
stockholder adoption or other approval of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement would
reasonably be expected to, either alone or in combination with another event,
result in the payment of any amount that would, individually or in
combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to provide, and
no Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any individual with the right to,
a gross-up, indemnification, reimbursement, make-whole or other payment for
any excise Taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A or
Section 4999 of the Code.

(l) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with
applicable local law, and all such plans that are intended to be funded and/or
book-reserved are funded and/or book-reserved, as appropriate, based upon
reasonable actuarial assumptions determined by qualified actuaries. As of the
date hereof, there is no pending or threatened material litigation relating to
Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.

with another event, will not require the consent of, negotiation with, or
advance notification to, any labor union, works council or like organization

bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any Governmental Entity
relating to employees or employment practices.

initially with the Company by operation of law.

 



-29- (c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, the operation of the Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses does
not infringe, misappropriate or violate the Intellectual Property Rights of
any other Person, and, since the Applicable Date, no Person has alleged the
same in writing (and/or sent a cease and desist letter or invitation to take
a patent license to the Company or its Subsidiaries) or challenged the
validity or enforceability of the Company or its Subsidiaries rights in their
Intellectual Property Rights. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person is
infringing, misappropriating or violating any material Intellectual Property
Rights of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries have sent any written notices to any Person alleging same.

licensed under the General Public License). No material proprietary software
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is licensed, distributed, conveyed
or made available to other Persons (whether incorporated into a product or
otherwise) contains, is derived from or otherwise interacts with any open
source software such that the Company or its Subsidiaries are required to
license or make available their proprietary source code to any Person under
such circumstances.

 

(f) No Person (other than employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
need to know basis) has possession of or the current or contingent right to

-30- 5.21. _Takeover Statutes_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation, including

provision in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws is
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

5.22. _Brokers and Finders_. Neither the Company nor any of its officers,
directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
except that the Company has employed Sandler ONeill as its financial advisor.
The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of all
agreements pursuant to which Sandler ONeill is entitled to any fees and
expenses in connection with the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated

5.23. _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company Disclosure Letter, or
any of the Schedules or Exhibits hereto or thereto, neither the Company nor

ARTICLE VI

 

 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_

 

Except as set forth in the referenced sections or subsections of the Company
Disclosure Letter, Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represents and warrants
to the Company that:

6.1. _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the
extent such concept is applicable, in good standing under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties, rights
and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is
qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept is applicable, is in
good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in
each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or, to the extent such concept
is applicable, in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or impair the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has made available to the
Company prior to the date hereof complete and correct copies of the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws or comparable governing documents,
each as amended, restated or amended and restated to the date hereof,
of Parent and Merger Sub, and each as so delivered is in full force and
effect.

 



-31- 6.2. _Corporate Authority_. No vote of holders of capital stock of Parent is
necessary to approve this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate
power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, subject only to adoption of this Agreement by a Subsidiary
of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each
of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

6.3. _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

 

(a) Other than the filings, notices, reports, consents, registrations,

5.4(a)(iv), Section 8.1(b) and Section 8.1(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, (v) the rules and regulations of NASDAQ and (vi) state securities,
takeover and "blue sky" Laws (the filings, notices, reports, consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, waivers, expirations of waiting periods
and authorizations contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi), the
" _Parent Approvals_ "), no filings, notices, reports, consents,
registrations, approvals, permits, waivers, expirations of waiting periods or
authorizations are required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub from or to
be given by Parent or Merger Sub to, or be made by Parent or Merger Sub with,
any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except those that the failure to give, make or obtain would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or
impair the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, constitute or
result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination or
cancellation (or right of termination or cancellation) of or a default under,
a requirement for consent under, the loss of any benefit under, the creation
or acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien (other
than a Permitted Lien) on any of the properties, rights or assets of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Contracts binding upon Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this
Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 6.3(a), under any applicable Law to which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is subject or (iii) any change in the rights or obligations
of any party under any Contract legally binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) directly above in
this Section 6.3(b), for any such breach, violation, termination,
cancellation, default, creation, acceleration or change that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay or impair the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



-32- 6.4. _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there are no Proceedings pending or,
to Parents Knowledge, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that seek to
enjoin, or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing,
making illegal, or otherwise interfering with, any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impair the
ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company complete and correct copies of (i) the
executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (together with
all exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_
"), from the Debt Financing Sources party thereto, pursuant to which the Debt
Financing Sources have agreed to provide, on the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, the full amount of the debt financing set forth therein
(the debt financing committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter is
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " _Debt Financing_ "), and
any fee letters related thereto, subject, in the case of such fee letters, to
redaction solely of fee and other economic provisions that are customarily
redacted in connection with transactions of this type and that do not
adversely affect the availability or amount of the Debt Financing, and (ii)
the executed equity commitment letters, dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Equity Commitment Letters_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter,
the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from Silver Lake Partners V, L.P. and P2
Fund I (the " _Equity Financing Sources_ ") pursuant to which the Equity
Financing Sources have committed to invest, on the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, cash in an amount up to the amounts set forth therein
(the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the "
_Financing_ ").

 

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments, as of the date
hereof, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Debt
Financing Sources to provide the Debt Financing or of the Equity Financing
Sources to provide the Equity Financing or any contingencies that would permit
the Debt Financing Sources or the Equity Financing Sources to reduce the total
amount of the Financing, including any condition or other contingency
relating to the availability of the Debt Financing pursuant to any "flex"
provision. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason
to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and
conditions to be satisfied by it in the Financing Commitments on or prior to
the Closing Date, nor does Parent or Merger Sub have knowledge that any of the
Debt Financing Sources or the Equity Financing Sources will not perform its
obligations thereunder. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters,
understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind
relating to the Financing Commitments that could adversely affect the
availability of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments.

 



-33- (c) The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments,
together with available cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries and other
available cash or other funds of Parent and its Subsidiaries, shall, in the
aggregate, provide Parent and its Subsidiaries with cash proceeds (after
netting out original issue discount and similar premiums and charges after
giving effect to the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount
flex) provided under the Debt Commitment Letter and any related fee letter) on
the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and
Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement and under the Debt Commitment
Letter, including paying (A) the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and
the other amounts payable under Article IV, (B) any and all fees and expenses
required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation at the
Closing in connection with the Merger and the Financing, including in respect
of the Convertible Notes, (C) for any refinancing of any outstanding
indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Agreement
and the Financing Commitments and (D) any amounts due in respect of the
Convertible Notes and the Convertible Note Warrants in connection with
or relating to the Merger (the " _Required Financing Amount_ ").

(d) As of the date hereof, each of the Financing Commitments is (i) a legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the
Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, of each of the other parties thereto,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and (ii) in full force and
effect. Assuming satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by Law) of
the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the
Merger, as of the date hereof, (i) no event has occurred which (with or
without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a failure to satisfy
a condition by Parent or Merger Sub under the terms and conditions of any
Financing Commitment and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied by
Parent on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent
or one or more of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date. Parent or Merger Sub
has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be
paid pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments on or before the date
hereof, and will pay (or cause to be paid) in full any such amounts due on or
before the Closing Date. The Financing Commitments have not been modified,
amended or altered as of the date hereof and, as of the date hereof, none of
the commitments under the Financing Commitments has been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect, and, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, no
withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated. To the Knowledge of Parent
and Merger Sub, no modification of, or amendment to, the Commitment Letters is
currently contemplated except for the addition of Debt Financing Sources, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, agents or similar entities who have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof.

6.6. _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming (a) the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 (in each
case, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at
the Closing), (b) that the representations and warranties set forth in
Article V as written are true and correct at and immediately after the Closing
and (c) the estimates, projections or forecasts provided by or on behalf of
the Company or its Subsidiaries to Parent or Merger Sub prior to the date
hereof (as may have been updated in writing prior to the date hereof) have
been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were, and continue to be,
reasonable, at and immediately after the Closing (it being understood
that Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with

 



-34-  Customers (Topic 606) shall not affect the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections or forecasts), then, after giving
effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Financing being entered into in connection therewith), the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries would be Solvent.

 

6.7. _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
each of the Guarantors has duly executed and delivered to the Company a
Limited Guarantee. As of the date hereof, each Limited Guarantee is in full
force and effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception, and has not been amended, withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of such
Guarantor under such Limited Guarantee.

6.8. _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger
Sub consists solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.
Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of the Merger, has not
conducted any business and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have
no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than
those incident to its formation, continued existence and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

6.9. _Ownership of Shares_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, P2 Fund I or any of
their respective "affiliates" or "associates" is an "interested stockholder"
of the Company subject to the restrictions on "business combinations" (in each
case, as such quoted terms are defined under Section 203 of the DGCL) set
forth in Section 203(a) of the DGCL.

6.10. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will,
at the time such document is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company
and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 

6.11. _No Other Parent or Merger Sub Representation or Warranties_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this
Section 7.2(b), at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior
to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the
Company and its Representatives may (A) in response to a request therefor by a
Person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.2(b), provide information
to such Person and its Representatives, its Affiliates and its prospective
equity and debt financing sources, if the Company receives from the Person so
requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
that are no more favorable to such Person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreements (unless the Company offers to amend the
Confidentiality Agreements to reflect such more favorable terms); _it_ _being_
_understood_ that such confidentiality agreement need not include explicit or
implicit standstill provisions that would restrict the making, amendment or
modification of a confidential Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,

such Person in connection with

 



-41-  any Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or offers or other

without the prior consent of Parent; _provided further_ , _however_ , that
(x) any such nonpublic information has previously been made available to
Parent or shall be made available to Parent prior to, or substantially
concurrently with, the time such information is made available to such
Person, and (y) any competitively sensitive information or data provided to

determined by the Company with advice from its outside legal counsel, or (B)
engage or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Person who has made such an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (I) prior to taking any action
described in clause (A) or (B) directly above, the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that failure to take such action, in light of the Acquisition
Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(II) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) directly above, the
Company Board has determined in good faith, based on the information then
available and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

as set forth in this Section 7.2(c), the Company Board and each committee of

Act in which the Company Board or the Company indicates that the Company Board
has not changed the Company Recommendation or (E) fail to reaffirm the
Company Recommendation within the earlier of three Business Days prior to the
Stockholders Meeting and five Business Days after receiving a written request
to do so from Parent (any of the foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_
"); or

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, the last
paragraph of this Section 7.2(c), cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) entered into in compliance with Section 7.2(a) or
7.2(b)) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise resolve or agree to do so.

 



-42- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 7.2(c), the
Company Board may, prior to but not after the time the Requisite Company Vote
is obtained, (A) make a Change of Recommendation if an Intervening Event has
occurred and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (B) make a Change of
Recommendation or, prior to the expiration of the Go-Shop Period only,
authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(a)
if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal and (I) prior to taking such
action, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure to take such
action, in light of the Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this Agreement,
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (II) the Company Board has determined in good
faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the Company Board may not
take any such action unless (I) there has been no breach of this Section 7.2,
(II) prior to making such Change of Recommendation or authorizing such
termination to enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 9.3(a), the Company provides prior
written notice to Parent at least five Business Days in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ ") of its intention to take such action and the basis thereof,
which notice shall include, in the case of a Superior Proposal, all required
information under Section 7.2(f) and, in the case of an Intervening Event, a
reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event, (III) during the
Notice Period the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (including providing Parent
the opportunity to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments thereto) should Parent propose to make
amendments or other revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal and, in the case of an Intervening
Event, the failure to take such action would no longer reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law
as determined by the Company Board in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor and (IV) the Company Board has
taken into account any amendments or other revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement agreed to by Parent in writing prior to the end
of the Notice Period and determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that a failure to make
such Change of Recommendation continues to reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _it_
_being_ _understood_ that any amendments or other revisions to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal,
including for purposes of the Notice Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that
subsequent to the initial Notice Period, the Notice Period shall be reduced to
three Business Days.

 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 7.2
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a)(2) or (3) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure that constitutes a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant
to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, which actions shall
not constitute or be deemed to constitute a Change of Recommendation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if such disclosure does not reaffirm the
Company Recommendation or has the effect of withdrawing or adversely
modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a
Change of Recommendation and Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 9.4(a).

 



-43- (e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that, from and after the No-
Shop Period Start Date, it will cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted theretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the
individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence of this Section
7.2(e) of the obligations undertaken in this Section 7.2. The Company
also agrees that it will as promptly as possible (and in all events within
twenty-four hours of the expiration of the Go-Shop Period) (i) request each
Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal or its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to
return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person by or
on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) terminate any data room
or other diligence access of such Person.

written notices to Parent pursuant to Section 7.2(c), within twenty-four
hours of the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company shall (x) notify
Parent in writing of the identity of each Person who signed a confidentiality
agreement contemplated by Section 7.2(a) or from whom the Company received an
Acquisition Proposal after the beginning of the Go-Shop Period and prior to
the No-Shop Period Start Date and (y) provide Parent with unredacted copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements, and
the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (or where no
such copies are available, a reasonably detailed written description thereof).
From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company agrees that it will
promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four hours) notify Parent if any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or that
may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal are received by,
any information in connection therewith is requested from, or any discussions
or negotiations related thereto are sought to be initiated or continued with,
it or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice,
the name of such Person making the Acquisition Proposal and providing
unredacted copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements, the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers (or where no such copies are available, a reasonably detailed written
description thereof) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on
a current basis, of the status and terms of any such inquiries, proposals or
offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Companys intentions
as previously notified.

(g) _Standstills_. During the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and the Effective Time,
the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality agreement, Standstill Agreement or similar agreement to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such
agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such
agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend, modify,

 



-44-  waive or fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality agreement,
Standstill Agreement or similar agreement to the extent the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. The Company acknowledges and agrees that nothing in the
Confidentiality Agreements shall prohibit, prevent or restrict the ability of
Parent or any Person acting on behalf of Parent to propose or make amendments
or other revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or otherwise
exercise its rights under the last paragraph of Section 7.2(c) and any acts
taken in connection therewith shall under no circumstances be considered a
breach of either of the Confidentiality Agreements.

 

7.3. _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, and in any event within five Business Days
after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, a proxy statement in preliminary
form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement,

Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of
the information included by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing

fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 7.2(c),
the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation and, unless there
has been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 7.2(c), the
Company will continue to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Requisite Company Vote including the solicitation of proxies therefor.

 

(b) The Company will provide Parent and its legal counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Proxy Statement and other
documents related to the Stockholders Meeting prior to filing such documents
with the applicable Governmental Entity and mailing such documents to the
Companys stockholders. The Company will consider in good faith for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement and such other documents related to the Stockholders
Meeting all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by Parent or its legal
counsel and the Company agrees that all information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries included in the Proxy Statement shall be in form and content
satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably. The Company shall ensure that the
Proxy Statement (i) will not on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of
the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting or filed with the SEC

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding

Statement and (B) Parent,

 



-45-  Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates assume no responsibility with

its Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement. If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
should be discovered by a party, which information should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that either the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and the
Company shall prepare (with the assistance of Parent) and mail to its
stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case, to the extent
required by applicable Law. The Company agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as
so corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to its stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Law.

Business Day, on the first Business Day subsequent to such day), to consider
and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and to cause such vote to be
taken, and shall not postpone, recess or adjourn such meeting except to the
extent required by applicable Law and with prior notice to Parent or, if, (i)

is scheduled (the " _Original Date_ "), (A) the Company has not received
proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is
present or (B) it is necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement is required to be delivered and in each case, if Parent so
requests, the Company shall postpone, recess or adjourn, or make one or more
successive postponements, recesses or adjournments of, the Stockholders
Meeting as long as the date of the Stockholders Meeting is not postponed,
recessed or adjourned more than ten days in connection with any one
postponement, recess or adjournment or more than an aggregate of thirty days
from the Original Date in reliance on the preceding sentence or (ii) within
the five Business Days prior to the Original Date or any date that the
Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to be held, the Company delivers a
notice of an intent to make a Change of Recommendation, Parent may direct the
Company to postpone, recess or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting for up to ten
Business Days and the Company shall promptly, and in any event no later than
the next Business Day, postpone, recess or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting in
accordance with Parents direction.

 

(b) Once the Company has established a record date for the Stockholders
Meeting, the Company will not change such record date or establish
a different record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, and, to the extent required by the
terms of this Agreement, the Company has paid to Parent the Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 9.5(b), its obligations to hold the Stockholders
Meeting pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall not be affected in any manner,
including in connection with (i) the making of a Change of Recommendation by
the Company Board or (ii) the commencement of or announcement or disclosure of
or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal.

 



-46- (c) Unless and until the Company Board shall have effected a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with Section 7.2(c), the Company Board shall
make the Company Recommendation.

(d) The Company agrees to provide Parent reasonably detailed periodic updates
concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if
requested, promptly providing daily voting reports). Without the prior written
consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement will be the only matter
(other than related procedural matters) that the Company will propose to be
acted on by the Companys stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting.

 

7.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt

responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy
Statement by the SEC, and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible after the date the SEC staff

part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as practicable, including, subject to the other provisions of this
Section 7.5, preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and

approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
including the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals. Subject
to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent shall have
the right to direct all matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with
its obligations hereunder; _provided_ that, subject to applicable Law, Parent
and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in

 



-47-  good faith the views of the other in connection with any material
correspondence, filings or communications with any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such materials
may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns, to the extent that such attorney-client or other
privilege or confidentiality concerns are not governed by a common interest
privilege or doctrine; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the Company
may, as each deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively
sensitive information provided to the other under this Section 7.5

source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be). In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, all obligations of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or any other financing for the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed exclusively by Sections

Business Days of the date hereof, an appropriate filing of a Notification and

entry of, and the commencement

 



-48-  of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in any suit or
proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or
preventing the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that any such sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition referred to above is conditioned upon clearance
under the HSR Act and any applicable non-U.S. antitrust, competition or
foreign investment Laws identified in Section 8.1(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter and consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(iii) Parent shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into
any transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction (including any
merger or acquisition) that would reasonably be expected to materially delay
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 8.1(b) or otherwise prevent
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 7.5(b), each of the Parties, as applicable, agrees (i) to prepare and

actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part to obtain as promptly as practicable any
approval, consent or waiver of any Governmental Entity (including the U.K.

of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company holding Money Transmitter
Licenses; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall any Person other
than Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries be required

responsible for, the obligations of any other Person (including by entering
into any capital maintenance, "keep well" or similar agreements or
arrangements).

shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other as promptly as reasonably
practicable with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,

Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other representatives or agents
to participate in any meeting, telephone call, or discussion with

Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.

Subsidiaries will make or agree to make any payment of a consent fee, "profit
sharing" payment or other consideration (including increased or accelerated
payments) or concede anything of monetary or economic value, for the purposes
of obtaining any such Third-Party Consents without the prior consent of
Parent.

7.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law and any applicable
privileges and protections (including attorney-client privilege, attorney
work-product protections and confidentiality protections) and contractual
confidentiality obligations, in each case that would not reasonably be
expected to be preserved or maintained through counsel-to-counsel disclosure,
redaction or other customary procedures (and with respect to any contractual
confidentiality obligations, so long as the Company has taken, or has caused
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to take, commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a waiver with respect to such contractual confidentiality obligations),
upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers and other Representatives

consultants) reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books,
contracts and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested (including, to the extent requested by Parent, the Debt Financing
Sources and consultants); _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this
Section 7.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company herein; and _provided_ _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require the Company (a) to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or
violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company
shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third
party to such inspection or disclosure or (b) to disclose any privileged
information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, it being

 



-50-  agreed that, in each case of clause (a) and (b), the Company shall give
notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to violate such restriction or waive the
applicable privilege or protection. All such information shall be governed by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements; _provided_ that (A) Parent shall
be permitted to involve, and to disclose such information in connection with
seeking, equity co-investors, subject to customary confidentiality
undertakings and (B) the disclosure of information to the Debt Financing
Sources pursuant to Section 7.14 or otherwise shall not require the
prior written consent of the Company pursuant to the Confidentiality

first Business Day that is at least ten days after the date the Form 25 is
filed (such period between the Form 25 filing date and the Form 15 filing
date, the " _Delisting Period_ "). If the Company is reasonably likely to be
required to file any quarterly or annual reports pursuant to the Exchange Act
during the Delisting Period, the Company will deliver to Parent at
least three Business Days prior to Closing a draft, which is sufficiently
developed such that it can be timely filed with a reasonable amount of effort
within the time available, of any such reports reasonably likely to be
required to be filed during the Delisting Period (" _Post-Closing SEC
Reports_ "). The Post-Closing SEC Reports provided by the Company pursuant to
this Section 7.7 will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
(including any opinion) or omit to state any material fact (including any
opinion) required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings,
furnishings or submissions of documents with any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange
or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation
service or by the request of any

 



-51-  Governmental Entity, in which case the Party making the disclosure shall
give the other Party reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such
disclosure or communication to the extent reasonably practicable and legally
permitted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Company may, without such
consultation or consent, make such disclosures and communications in response
to inquiries from the press or analysts, or via presentations, publicly
available conference calls and other forums to employees, customers, suppliers
and investors to the extent such communications are consistent in substance
with previous public communications that have been reviewed and previously
approved by both the Company and Parent and (B) Parent, Merger Sub and their
Affiliates may, without such consultation or consent, make disclosures and
communications to existing or prospective general and limited partners,
equity holders, members, managers and investors of such Person or any

affected by the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended
communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review

in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of
their benefit plans or, after the Effective Time, any Benefit Plan in
accordance with their terms, (iii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation

Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Proceeding arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or

bylaws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the Companys certificate
of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that the

reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, the Company may (and shall use
reasonable best efforts to consult with Parent), or Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for

Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply
with its obligations (including any conversion or repurchase obligations)
under the Convertible Notes Indenture and any Supplemental Indentures thereto.
For the avoidance of doubt, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
wherever referred to in this Agreement, shall be deemed to include effecting
any repurchases or conversions and taking all other actions required under the
terms of the Convertible Notes and the Convertible Notes Indenture.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.12(a), nothing
herein shall require the Company to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs
or expenses or make any payment in the connection with the Convertible Notes
or this Section 7.12(a) (including in connection with the settlement of any
conversion obligations), prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate the settlement of the Convertible Note Hedge
Obligations and the Convertible Note Warrants at the Effective Time as
reasonably requested by Parent (it being understood that any such settlement
will be subject to the respective terms of the Convertible Note Hedge
Obligations and the Convertible Note Warrants, as such terms may be amended or
modified from time to time after the date hereof with the prior written
consent of Parent), and (ii) cooperate with Parent with respect to its
efforts to settle the Convertible Note Hedge Obligations and the Convertible
Note Warrants and the negotiation of any termination payment or valuation
related thereto, as applicable;  _provided_ that the Company shall not (x)
exercise any right that it may have to terminate any of the Convertible Note
Hedge Obligations or any of the Convertible Note Warrants or (y) agree to
amend or modify the terms relating to, or agree to any amount due upon, the
termination or settlement thereof, in each case, without the prior written
consent of Parent; _provided further_ , that nothing herein shall require the
Company to (A) pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or
make any payment in connection with any Convertible Note Hedge Obligations and
the Convertible Note Warrants or pursuant to this Section 7.12(b) prior to the
occurrence of the Effective Time or (B) enter into any instrument or
agreement, or agree to any change or modification to any instrument or
agreement, that is effective prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time.

 

7.13. _Financing_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and shall use reasonable best efforts to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions
contained in any related fee letter) as promptly as possible but in any event
prior to the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated
pursuant to the terms hereof,

 



-55-  including by using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Financing Commitments and comply with its obligations thereunder in all
material respects, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary,
the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee letter) or, if available,
on other terms that (A) are acceptable to Parent in its sole discretion, (B)
would not reasonably be expected to delay (taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period) or adversely affect the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (C) would otherwise be
permitted by Section 7.13(b) and comply with its obligations thereunder, and
(iii) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period,
satisfy (or, if reasonably required to obtain the Financing, seek the waiver
of) on a timely basis all conditions in the Financing Commitments and the
Definitive Agreements that are within the control of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. In the event that all conditions contained in the Financing
Commitments or the Definitive Agreements (except those that, by their nature,
are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, Parent
and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt
Financing Sources and the Equity Financing Sources thereunder to comply with
their respective obligations, including to fund the Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related
fees and expenses on the Closing Date. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use
its reasonable best efforts to comply with its respective obligations, and
enforce its respective rights, under the Financing Commitments and Definitive
Agreements in a timely and diligent manner. Parent and Merger Sub shall give
the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Financing
Commitments or the Definitive Agreements of which Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, has obtained Knowledge and the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any Debt Financing Source or Equity Financing
Source with respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the Financing Commitments or any Definitive Agreement of any
provision thereof.

(b) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, without the prior written consent of
the Company: (i) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Financing Commitments if such amendment,
modification, waiver or remedy (A) adds any new (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the
Financing, (B) reduces the amount of the Financing to an amount that, together
with available cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries and other available
cash or other funds of Parent and its Subsidiaries, would on the Closing Date
be less than the Required Financing Amount, (C) adversely affects in a
material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter,
the Definitive Agreements or the Equity Commitment Letters, in each case, as
so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment
Letters, as applicable, as in effect on the date hereof or (D) could otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period);
_provided_ , that Parent or Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof; or (ii) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the
Equity Commitment Letters unless such

 



-56-  Debt Commitment Letter or Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable, is
replaced at such time with a new commitment letter that would satisfy the
preceding clause (i). Upon any such permitted amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with this Section 7.13(b), the terms "Debt Commitment Letter" and
"Debt Financing" shall refer to the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended,
supplemented, modified, waived or replaced and the debt financing contemplated
thereby. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of
any such Debt Commitment Letter or any amendment, supplement,
waiver, modification, waiver or replacement of the Equity Commitment Letter.

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent and Merger Sub will (i) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount
sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Financing,
available cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries and other available cash
or other funds of Parent and its Subsidiaries, to provide the Required
Financing Amount) from the same or other sources on terms and conditions that
are not less favorable to Parent and its Subsidiaries than the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof,
and which do not include any terms or conditions to the consummation of such
alternative debt financing that would reasonably be expected to make the
funding of such alternative debt financing less likely to occur than the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, and
(ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the
reason therefor. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or
similar agreement) with respect to any alternative or replacement financing
arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter remaining in
effect at the time in question), and Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies thereof. If requested by the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall inform the Company as to the status of its efforts to
consummate the Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding, and without limiting
the effect of Section 9.5(f) and Section 10.5, compliance by Parent and Merger
Sub with this Section 7.13 shall not relieve Parent and Merger Sub of their
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
whether or not the Financing is available. Without limiting the effect of
Section 9.5(f) and Section 10.5, in no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Financing) by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent or any other financing or
other transactions be a condition to any of Parents or Merger
Subs obligations under this Agreement.

7.14. _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to,
and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its and their Representatives
to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent necessary and
customary for the arrangement of the Debt Financing ( _provided_ , that
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, such reasonable best efforts in any event shall
include (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including
meetings with prospective Debt Financing Sources), presentations, road shows,
due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, at reasonable times
and with 

 



-57-  reasonable advance notice, (ii) to the extent required by the Debt Financing
and requested by Parent, using reasonable best efforts to facilitate the
pledging of, and perfection of security interests in, collateral, effective
no earlier than the Effective Time, (iii) furnishing Parent and the Debt
Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably practicable following the delivery
of a request therefor to the Company by Parent (which notice shall state with
specificity the information requested) such financial and other information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as is customarily required in
connection with the execution of financings of a type similar to the
Debt Financing, including the Required Financial Information, (iv) in each
case following Parents reasonable request, using reasonable best efforts to
assist Parent and Merger Sub in the preparation of (A) confidential
information memoranda (including a version that does not include material
non-public information) and other customary marketing materials required in
connection with financings similar to the Debt Financing and (B) materials
for rating agency presentations, (v) following Parents reasonable request,
using reasonable best efforts to cause directors and officers who will
continue to hold such offices and positions from and after the Effective Time
to execute resolutions or consents of the Company and its Subsidiaries that do
not become effective until the Effective Time with respect to entering into
the Definitive Agreements and otherwise as necessary to authorize consummation
of the Debt Financing, (vi) providing (A) customary authorization and
representation letters to the Debt Financing Sources with respect to marketing
materials from a senior officer of the Company and (B) a certificate of the
chief financial officer of the Company in the form set forth on Annex A to
Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date hereof) with
respect to solvency matters, (vii) if requested by Parent, provide, at least
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all documentation and other
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as is required by
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001 to the extent requested
by Parent in writing at least nine Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, (viii) assisting reasonably in the preparation, execution and
delivery of necessary and customary Definitive Agreements (including one or
more credit agreements, security agreements, mortgages and/or guarantees and
the schedules and exhibits thereto) in connection with the Debt Financing or
other certificates or documents as may reasonably be requested by Parent, in
each case, effective as of Closing, and (ix) using commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts with respect to the Debt
Financing benefit materially from the existing lending and investment banking
relationships of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 7.14 or otherwise, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this Section 7.14 that would: (i) require the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors or officers of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or
authorize the execution of the Debt Financing that is effective prior to the
Effective Time or execute or deliver any certificate, opinion, document,
instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing
certificate, opinion, document, instrument or agreement that is effective
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cause any representation or warranty in
this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in connection
with the Financing prior to the Closing or have any obligation of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document, instrument or
agreement be effective until the Closing, (iv) cause any director, officer,
employee or stockholder of the Company or any of its

 



-58-  Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (v) conflict with the
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Laws, (vi) reasonably be expected to result in a material violation or breach
of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (vii)
provide access to or disclose information that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries reasonably determines would jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege or other applicable privilege of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (viii) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the occurrence of
the Closing or that would be effective if the Closing does not occur (other
than customary authorization and representation letters) or (ix) require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to prepare any financial statements or
information that (a) are not available to it and prepared in the ordinary
course of its financial reporting practice or (b) would not be otherwise
available to it or capable of being prepared by it without undue burden or
otherwise with the use of commercially reasonable efforts. Nothing contained
in this Section 7.14 or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to the Debt Financing. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action taken by them at the
request of Parent pursuant to this Section 7.14 and any information used in
connection therewith (other than information provided in writing by the
Company or its Subsidiaries specifically in connection with its obligations
pursuant to this Section 7.14), and Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
and any action taken by them pursuant to this Section 7.14.

(b) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant
to this Section 7.14 shall be kept confidential and otherwise treated in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreements or other confidentiality
obligations that are substantially similar to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreements (which, with respect to the Debt Financing Sources,
shall be satisfied by the confidentiality provisions applicable thereto
under the Debt Commitment Letter or other customary confidentiality
undertakings in the context of customary syndication practices from Debt
Financing Sources not party to the Debt Commitment Letter). The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Debt Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that
is reasonable and customary and that is not reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries in any respect.

7.15. _Repayment of Indebtedness_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall on a timely basis as requested by Parent (a) deliver (or cause to be
delivered) notices of prepayment and/or termination of the indebtedness of the
Company under the Credit Agreement (which notices may be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Closing and other transactions contemplated hereunder
(including the Debt Financing)) within the time periods required by the Credit
Agreement, (b) take all other reasonable actions required to facilitate the
repayment of the Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement but other
than contingent obligations for which no claim has been made and any other
obligations that survive the termination of the Credit Agreement pursuant to
the terms thereof) with respect to and termination of the commitments under
such indebtedness and the release of any Liens and termination of all
guarantees granted in

 



-59-  connection therewith on the Closing Date in connection with such repayment
(each such termination, repayment and release a " _Credit Agreement
Termination_ ") and (c) use reasonable best efforts to obtain a customary
pay-off letter from the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) under the Credit Agreement at least one Business Day prior to
Closing (subject to the delivery of funds as arranged by Parent) and use
reasonable best efforts to obtain and furnish Parent with a draft of such pay-
off letter within a reasonable time period prior to the contemplated
Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (x) in no
event shall this Section 7.15 require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to cause any Credit Agreement Termination unless the Closing shall have
occurred and (y) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, all funds
required to effect all such repayments and shall provide, or cause to be
provided, all funds required to effect all such repayments and cash
collateralization, backstop or replacement of letters of credit.

7.16. _Approval of Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub_. Promptly following
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver (or cause a
Subsidiary to execute and deliver), in accordance with applicable Law and
Merger Subs certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in such Persons
capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent approving the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and adopting
this Agreement.

7.17. _Other Actions by the Company_.

(a) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the

eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

shall take such further actions, if any, as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including any derivative securities) pursuant to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any officer or director
of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(c) _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought, or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened,
against the Company or any members of the Company Board after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company
shall promptly notify Parent of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep
Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any
Transaction Litigation, shall consider in good faith Parents advice with
respect to such Transaction Litigation and shall not settle or agree to settle

those conditions could be satisfied if the Closing were to occur), (ii) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed by written notice to Parent that (A) all
conditions set forth in Section 8.3 have been satisfied (other than those

(c) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue
after the date hereof, such that any of the conditions set forth in Section
8.2(a) or 8.2(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is
not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (i) thirty
days after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and (ii)
one Business Day before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
is not also in breach of this Agreement such that any of the conditions set

condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of
(A) thirty days after written notice thereof is given by the Company to

9.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

(a) Any termination of this Agreement under this Article IX will be effective
immediately upon the delivery of a valid written notice of the terminating
Party to the other Parties and, if then due, payment of the termination fee
required pursuant to this Section 9.5. Except as provided in paragraph (b)
below, in the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of
the Merger pursuant to this Article IX, this Agreement shall become void and
of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any Party (or of
any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (i) subject to
Section 9.5(g), no such termination shall relieve the Company of any liability
or damages to the other Parties resulting from fraud or any Willful and
Material Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination and (ii) the
provisions set forth in this Section 9.5 and the second sentence of Section
10.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



-65- (b) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated (I) by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 9.2(a), (II) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 9.2(b) or (III) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.4(c) and (B) (I)
before receipt of the Requisite Company Vote an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to the Company Board, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or shall have been publicly made or disclosed or any Person shall
have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and (II) within twelve months of such termination, (x) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have approved
or recommended to the Companys stockholders or otherwise not opposed, an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (i)(B)(I)) or (y) there shall have
been consummated an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition
Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (i)(B)(I))
(substituting in both instances "50%" for "15%" in the definition
of "Acquisition Proposal");

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.4 (other
than pursuant to Section 9.4(c)); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.3(a);

 

then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days
after the date of such termination, pay a termination fee of $109,000,000
(the " _Termination Fee_ ") to P2 Capital Partners, LLC and Silver Lake
Management Company V, L.L.C. (or their respective designees) in such amounts
as Parent notifies to the Company in writing (which amounts collectively
shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, exceed the Termination Fee) (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Termination Fee to be paid pursuant to (I)
clause (i) shall be paid immediately prior to or substantially
concurrent with the earliest of (x) the entry by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or (y)
consummation or approval or recommendation to the Companys stockholders of,
or (z) otherwise non-opposition to, such an Acquisition Proposal
(substituting "50%" for "15%" in the definition thereof) (whether or not such
Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause
(i)(B)(I)) within twelve months of such termination, and (II) clause (iii)
shall be paid as set forth in Section 9.3(a)) payable by wire transfer
of same-day funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Termination Fee shall
mean a fee of $81,700,000 instead of $109,000,000 in the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.3(a) and the fee is paid on or
prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date. In no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) The Company shall reimburse P2 Capital Partners, LLC and Silver Lake
Management Company V, L.L.C. (or their respective designees) for
the documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement including the Financing (including fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, other advisors and financing sources) (i)
subject to an aggregate cap on reimbursement of $6,800,000, if the Company or
Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(b), the Company
shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(a) or Parent shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4(a), 9.4(b) or 9.4(c) and the
Termination Fee shall be payable by the Company as a result of such
termination, or (ii) subject to an aggregate cap on reimbursement of
$27,200,000, if the Company or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.2(b) at a time 

 



-66-  when neither the Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is otherwise
payable (although damages may still be payable by the Company) (the amount
paid pursuant to either clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, the " _Expense
Reimbursement_ "). The Expense Reimbursement shall be paid either (x) in the
case of clause (i), to the extent not previously paid, then concurrent with or
promptly following payment of the Termination Fee, but in no event later than
two Business Days after being notified of such by Parent or (y) in the case of
clause (ii), in no event later than two Business Days after being notified of
such by Parent, in each case by wire transfer of same-day funds to P2 Capital
Partners, LLC and Silver Lake Management Company V, L.L.C. (or their
respective designees) in such amounts as Parent notifies to the Company in
writing (which amounts collectively shall not, for the avoidance of doubt,
exceed the applicable Expense Reimbursement).

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 9.3(b) or 9.3(c), then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Company an amount equal to $136,200,000 (such payment, the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of same-day funds within three
Business Days following such termination ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that in
no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more
than one occasion).

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
Sections 9.5(b), 9.5(c) and 9.5(d) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
Parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement and the damages resulting
from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Termination
Fee or Parent Termination Fee and other amounts payable under Sections 9.5(b),
9.5(c) and 9.5(d) are payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and, therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Sections
9.5(b), 9.5(c) and 9.5(d) are not a penalty but rather constitute amounts
akin to liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent
or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, if a Party
fails to promptly pay the amount due by it pursuant to Sections 9.5(b),
9.5(c) or 9.5(d) and, in order to obtain such payment another Party or the
other Parties hereto commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment against
the defaulting Party for the fee set forth in Sections 9.5(b), 9.5(c) or
9.5(d), or any portion of such fee, the defaulting Party shall pay to the
other Parties their costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in
connection with such Proceeding, together with interest on the amount of the
fee at the prime rate set forth in the _Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_
, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made from the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 10.5, each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges
and agrees that the Companys right to terminate this Agreement and for the
Company to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent it is
payable pursuant to this Section 9.5 shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and
any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, equityholders, members, managers, directors,
officers, employees, agents or Affiliates

 



-67-  (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") against Parent, the
Guarantors and Parents and the Guarantors respective Affiliates, the Debt
Financing Sources, any other potential debt or equity financing source and
any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, equityholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents or Affiliates or any former, current or future general or
limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, member, manager, director,
officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (collectively,
the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages in respect of
this Agreement (or the termination thereof) or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (or the failure of such transactions to occur for any reason
or for no reason) or any breach (whether willful, intentional, unilateral or
otherwise) of any covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of this
Agreement or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith, and, subject to Parents obligation to pay the Parent Termination
Fee to the Company to the extent it is payable pursuant to Section 9.5(d) and
Section 10.5, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any liability or
obligation to any of the Company Related Parties relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Limited Guarantees, the Financing Commitments or the
transactions contemplated hereby and none of the Company, its Subsidiaries nor
any other Company Related Party shall seek to recover any other damages or
seek any other remedy, whether based on a claim at law or in equity, in
contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages suffered in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any
oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. In no
event shall Parent be subject to (nor shall any Company Related Party seek to
recover) monetary damages other than the Parent Termination Fee to the extent
it is payable pursuant to Section 9.5(d) for any losses or other liabilities
arising out of or in connection with breaches by Parent of its
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement or arising from any claim or cause of action that any Company
Related Party may have, including for a breach of Section 1.2 as a result of
the Debt Financing not being available to be drawn down or otherwise arising
from the Financing Commitments or in respect of any oral representation made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith.

(g) While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a grant of specific
performance or other equitable relief under Section 10.5 and, following
termination of this Agreement, the payment of monetary damage (which are only
available with respect to a breach by the Company) or the Termination Fee or
the Parent Termination Fee under this Section 9.5, as applicable, under no
circumstances shall the Company or Parent be entitled to receive both (i) a
grant of specific performance or other equitable relief that results in the
Equity Financing being funded or the Closing occurring and (ii) monetary
damages (which are only available with respect to a breach by the Company) or
the payment of the Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, in connection with this Agreement or any termination of this
Agreement (although Parent may be able to receive both monetary damages with
respect to a Willful and Material Breach by the Company and the Termination
Fee).

 _Miscellaneous and General_

 

10.1. _Survival_. This Article X and the agreements of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub contained in Section 7.10 and Section 9.5 and the Confidentiality

Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may modify or
amend this Agreement by written agreement, executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the respective Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
after receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, no amendment may be made which,
by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange,
requires further approval by the Companys stockholders unless the Requisite
Company Vote is obtained again with respect to the effectiveness of such

the provisions of which the Debt Financing Sources are expressly made third-
party beneficiaries (or any of the defined terms used therein) pursuant to

Source without the prior written consent of such Debt Financing Source.

10.3. _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the Parties
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such Party
and may be waived by such Party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws. No failure or delay by any Party exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

10.4. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS, RULES OR PRINCIPLES
THEREOF (OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS, RULES OR
PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

 

(b) The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States
of America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or
of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such Proceeding
may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue
thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may
not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties irrevocably agree that
all claims relating to such Proceeding or transactions shall be heard and
determined in such a Delaware state or federal court. The Parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such
dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with
any such Proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.6 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

 



-69- (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties agrees (on behalf of
itself and its respective Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and
any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, equityholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents or Affiliates) that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources or any of their
respective Representatives, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter or any other letter or agreement related to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof), in any forum other than any state or federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, except to the extent expressly provided by the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements, claims and actions that
may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to, the Debt Financing or involve
the Debt Financing Sources or their Representatives (whether in law,
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) shall be exclusively governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving
effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether
of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 

(d) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO HEREIN OR THE
MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING
ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT FINANCING, THE
DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR ANY OTHER LETTER OR AGREEMENT RELATED TO THE DEBT
FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES

UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED BY THE DOCUMENTS
REFERRED TO HEREIN OR THE MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
AND THEREBY, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS SECTION 10.4.

 



-70- 10.5. _Specific Performance_

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the rights of each Party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are special, unique and of
extraordinary character and that if for any reason any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or damage would be
caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly,
each Party agrees that, in addition to any other available remedies the
Parties may have in equity or at law, each Party shall be entitled to specific
performance and injunctive relief as a remedy for any such breach including
an injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened breach or
violation of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware without necessity of posting a bond or other form of
security; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such state court does not have
jurisdiction over such Proceeding, such Proceeding shall be heard
and determined exclusively in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware without necessity of posting a bond or other form of
security. In the event that any Proceeding should be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each
Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties
hereby agree that the Company shall only be entitled to specific performance
of Parents obligations to, or any other equitable remedy which would, cause
the Equity Financing to be funded or to effect the Closing if, and only if,
(i) all the conditions in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 have been satisfied or waived
(other than those that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but which conditions at such time are capable of being satisfied) at the time
the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 and Parent
fails to complete the Closing on the date it is required to have occurred,
(ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is
granted and the Financing (including any replacement financing that has been
obtained in accordance with Section 7.13) is funded, then the Company will
cause the Closing to occur.

10.6. _Notices_. All notices, requests, instructions, consents, claims,
demands, waivers and other communications to be given or made hereunder by any
Party shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made
on the date of receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to 5:00
p.m. in the place of receipt and such day is a Business Day (or otherwise on
the next succeeding Business Day) if (a) served by personal delivery or by a
nationally recognized overnight courier service upon the Party for whom it is

hereby further agree that this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
Proceeding that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,

requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such

severable and the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other

therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be legal, valid and enforceable,
the intent and purpose of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision,
and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such illegality,
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such illegality, invalidity or

provisions that the payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the

 



-73-  recipient thereof, limitations on specific performance and other equitable
remedies in Section 10.5 and the other limitations on the liabilities of the
