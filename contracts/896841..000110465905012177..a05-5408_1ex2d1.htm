WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger
(the "Merger") of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the California General
Corporation Law (the "CGCL"), as a result of which the Company shall become a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and

Company Voting Proposal and the stockholders of the Buyer listed on _Schedule
A_ have entered into the voting agreement, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "Buyer Stockholder

things, granted the Company a proxy to vote all of the shares of capital
stock of the Buyer that such stockholders own in favor of the Buyer Voting
Proposals; and

  



  

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that

# **ARTICLE II**

  



  

# **CONVERSION OF SECURITIES**

  

# 

  

## 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory
Subsidiary:

  

## 

  

### (a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_.  Each share of the
common stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of common stock,
without par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") that are
owned by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary
or any other wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.1(b) hereof) of
the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no stock of the Buyer or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Exchange Ratio and Per Share Cash Consideration for Company Common
Stock_. Subject to Section 2.1(d) and Section 2.2, each share of Company
Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section
2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.4 below)) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive (i) 0.0869 share (the "Exchange Ratio")
of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Buyer ("Buyer Common
Stock") plus (ii) $1.00 in cash (the "Per Share Cash Payment" and, together
with the foregoing Buyer Common Stock, the "Merger Consideration") upon
surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock
in the manner provided in Section 2.2. As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest on the Per Share Cash Payment, and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued or paid
in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Changes in Capitalization_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Buyer Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to Buyer Common Stock occurring (or for which
a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.  The Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash Payment shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

## 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for Merger Consideration pursuant
to the Merger are as follows:

  

## 

  

### (a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit
with the BuyerÂ’s transfer agent or another bank or trust company designated
by the Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"),
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange
Agent, (i) certificates representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock payable
with respect to the Company Common Stock outstanding as of the Effective
Time and the aggregate Per Share Cash Payment payable with respect to the
Company Common Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time (such shares of
Buyer Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto with a record date after the Effective Time, and such Per Share Cash
Payment being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make payments for fractional
shares required pursuant to Section 2.2(e), and (iii) any dividends
or distributions to which holders of certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Certificates") whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into
the right to receive shares of Buyer Common Stock may then be entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event, no later than five business days after the
Effective Time), the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as the Buyer may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for (A) certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock (plus
cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Buyer Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions as provided below) plus (B) the Per Share Cash
Payment payable with respect such Certificate. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as
may be appointed by the Buyer, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (and the Exchange Agent shall transmit to such
holder no later than five business days after receipt of the foregoing items
from such holder) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock and the Per Share Cash Payment that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II plus cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends
or distributions then payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.  No interest will
accrue or be paid on any payment payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number
of shares of Buyer Common Stock and the Per Share Cash Payment, plus cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or
distributions then payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) may be issued or paid
to a Person (as defined below) other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered,

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

### if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and, if
applicable, by evidence that any stock transfer taxes have been paid.  Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of Buyer
Common Stock and the Per Share Cash Payment payable with respect such
Certificate, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and any dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to Section
2.2(c) as contemplated by this Section 2.2. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Person" shall mean an individual, corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, association, trust, unincorporated
organization or other entity.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.  No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder of record of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
issued and paid to the record holder of the Certificate, at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock, without interest, and, at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions having a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender that are payable with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common
Stock.

  

### 

  

### (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of
Buyer Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash or dividends or other
distributions paid pursuant to Sections 2.2(c) or 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

  

### 

  

### (e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
the Buyer.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such
holder and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented
thereby) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by
the Buyer Closing Price. "Buyer Closing Price" shall mean the last reported
sales price of Buyer Common Stock at 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, end of regular
trading hours on The Nasdaq Stock Market on

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

### the Effective Date (or, if the Effective Date is not a trading day, the
last trading day preceding the Effective Date).

  

### 

  

### (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for a
period of one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer,
upon demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock who has not
previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the
Buyer, as a general unsecured creditor, for payment of its claim for Buyer
Common Stock, the Per Share Cash Payment, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Buyer Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (g) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of
the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or Buyer Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any shares of Buyer Common Stock, the Per Share Cash Payment and any cash
payable to the holder of such Certificate or any dividends or distributions
payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to this Article II would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any
such shares of Buyer Common Stock, the Per Share Cash Payment or cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, the Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Transitory
Subsidiary and the Exchange Agent shall have the right to deduct and withhold
Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder if such withholding is required
by law and to collect any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the
appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information,
from the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and any other recipients
of payments hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been delivered and paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock or other recipient of payments in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the shares of Buyer Common Stock, the Per Share Cash
Payment and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares of Buyer Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

## 2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:

  

### 

  

#### (i) with respect to each option (the "Company Stock Options") to
purchase Company Common Stock granted under any stock option plans or other
equity-related plans of the Company (the "Company Stock Plans") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, to cause the vesting of any unvested
portion of such Company Stock Options to be accelerated in full effective

#### 

  

#### (ii) to cause each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time to be (A) exercised for shares of Company Common Stock
prior to the Effective Time, (B) converted into the right to receive shares
of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(b) as of or immediately
prior to the Effective Time or (C) cancelled in accordance with 2.3(c) as of
or immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

#### 

  

### (b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock less than the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Buyer
Closing Price plus (ii) $1.00 shall receive from the Buyer, in respect and in
consideration of each Company Stock Option so cancelled, upon surrender of
such option, a number of Units per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option equal to a fraction (i) the numerator of which is
(A) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Buyer Closing Price plus (B) $1.00
less (C) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option, and (ii) the denominator of which is (A) the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by the Buyer Closing Price plus (B) $1.00. Each Unit shall
consist of a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio plus $1.00 in cash.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time with an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
greater than or equal to the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by
Buyer Closing Price plus (ii) $1.00 shall be cancelled and have no further
force or effect as of the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (d) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of a Company Stock Option a
letter describing the treatment of such Company Stock Option pursuant to this
Section 2.3 and providing instructions for use in (i) exercising such Company
Stock Options for shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time
or (ii) if not exercised prior to the Effective Time, receiving Buyer Common
Stock and cash pursuant to Section 2.3(b) in exchange for the cancellation of
such Company Stock Option.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Company shall terminate its 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "Company ESPP") in accordance with its terms as of or prior to the
Effective Time.

## 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the date for determination of
shareholders entitled to vote on the Merger and not voted in favor of the
approval of the principal terms of the Merger (or in the case of shares
described in Section 1300(b)(i)(A) or (B) of the CGCL (without regard to the
provisions in that paragraph) that were voted against the Merger) and with
respect to which appraisal shall have been duly demanded and perfected in
accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL and not effectively withdrawn or
forfeited prior to the Effective Time ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive shares of Buyer Common Stock
in accordance with Section 2.1 unless the rights of the holder of such
Dissenting Shares to appraisal shall have ceased in accordance with Section
1309 of the CGCL. If the holder of Dissenting shares has so forfeited or
withdrawn such holderÂ’s rights to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then (i) as
of the occurrence of such event, such holderÂ’s Dissenting Shares shall cease
to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the right
to receive shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1, and
(ii) following the occurrence of such event, upon proper surrender of the
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2 the Buyer shall deliver to such
the holder of the Dissenting Shares the shares of Buyer Common Stock to which

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such

the Company and (ii) the opportunity to determine the statement of price
required by Section 1301(a) of the CGCL and to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the CGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Buyer, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Common Stock or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

committee of the Boards of Directors of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries held since January 1, 2002 (excluding all names and information
required to be redacted in compliance with applicable laws governing the
sharing of information or in accordance with existing nondisclosure
agreements). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Material
Adverse Effect" means any material adverse change, event, circumstance or
development with respect to, or material adverse effect on, (i) the business,
assets, liabilities, capitalization, condition (financial or other), or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (ii) the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) the ability of the Buyer to operate
the business of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries immediately after
the Closing; provided, however, none of the following in and of itself or
themselves shall be deemed to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect:
(w) any decrease in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common
Stock after the date hereof (provided, however, that the exception in this
clause shall not in any way prevent or otherwise affect a determination that
any change, event, circumstance, development or effect underlying such
decrease has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse
Effect); (x) any failure by the Company to meet internal projections or
forecasts or published revenue or earnings predictions for any period ending
(or for which revenues or earnings are released) on or after the date of this
Agreement (provided, however, that the exception in this clause shall not in
any way prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change, event,
circumstance, development or effect underlying such failure has resulted in,
or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect); (y) any cancellation
or deferral of customer orders, reductions in sales, disruption in supplier,
distributor, partner or similar relationships or loss of broadcast employees,
in each case to the extent attributable to the public announcement or
pendency of the Merger; or (z) any adverse change, event, circumstance,
development or effect that results from changes attributable to conditions
affecting the industries in which the Company participates or the economy as
a whole in the United States or the other countries in which the Company
conducts its principal operations or derives significant sales (which changes
in each case do not disproportionately adversely affect the Company and its
Subsidiaries compared to other companies of similar size operating in the
industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate). For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the terms "material", "materially"
or "materiality" as used in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m"
shall have their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard
to the meanings ascribed to Company Material Adverse Effect in the prior
sentence of this paragraph or Buyer Material Adverse Effect in Section 4.1.

Subsidiary (i) has any actual or potential liability under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable or similar provision

pursuant to any contractual obligation, or otherwise for any Taxes of any
Person other than the Company or any Subsidiary, or (ii) is a party to or
bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing, Tax allocation or similar agreement.

Return that was not filed. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has (i)
waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to extend

the Transitory Subsidiary to the Company on or before the date of this
Agreement (the "Buyer Disclosure Schedule"). The Buyer Disclosure Schedule
shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the numbered
and lettered sections paragraphs contained in this Article IV and the
disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify (a) the corresponding sections and
paragraphs in this Article IV and (b) the other paragraphs in this Article
IV only to the extent that it is clear from a reading of such disclosure that
it also qualifies or applies to such other sections and paragraphs.

  



  

## 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted and
as proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties it owns, operates or leases or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except for such failures to be
so organized, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, that have not had, and may not reasonably be expected to have, a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Buyer Material Adverse Effect" means any material adverse change, event,
circumstance or development with respect to, or any material adverse effect
on, (i) the business, assets, liabilities, capitalization, condition
(financial or other), or results of operations of the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, none of the following in and of itself or
themselves shall be deemed to constitute a Buyer Material Adverse Effect:
 (w) any decrease in the market price or trading volume of the Buyer Common
Stock after the date hereof (provided, however, that the exception in
this clause shall not in any way prevent or otherwise affect a determination
that any change, event, circumstance, development or effect underlying such
decrease has resulted in, or contributed to, a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect); (x) any failure by the Buyer to meet forecasts or published revenue
or earnings predictions for any period ending (or for which revenues or
earnings are released) on or after the date of this Agreement (provided,
however, that the exception in this clause shall not in any way prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any change, event, circumstance,
development or effect underlying such failure has resulted in, or contributed
to, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect); (y) any cancellation or deferral of
customer orders, reductions in sales, disruption in supplier, distributor,
partner or similar relationships or loss of broadcast employees, in each case
to the extent attributable to the public announcement or pendency of the
Merger; or (z) any adverse change, event, circumstance, development or effect
that results from changes attributable to conditions affecting the industries
in which the

## Buyer participates or the economy as a whole in the United States or the
other countries in which the Buyer conducts its principal operations
or derives significant sales (which changes in each case do not
disproportionately adversely affect the Buyer and its Subsidiaries compared
to other companies of similar size operating in the industry in which the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries operate).

  

## 

  

## 4.2 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Buyer consists
of 50,000,000 shares of Buyer Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $.01 par value per share (the "Buyer Preferred Stock"), of which
500,000 shares are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
The rights and privileges of each class of the BuyerÂ’s capital stock are set
forth in the BuyerÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation. As of the close of
business on March 18, 2005, 35,128,678 shares of Buyer Common Stock were
issued and outstanding and no shares of Buyer Preferred Stock were issued or
outstanding. No material change in such capitalization has occurred between
December 31, 2004 and the date of this Agreement. All shares of Buyer Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) in connection with the Merger, when
issued on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, will be, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first
refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any
provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the BuyerÂ’s Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws or any agreement to which the Buyer is a party or is
otherwise bound.

### (a) Each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary has all requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject only

50,000,000 to 100,000,000 (the "Buyer Charter Approval", and collectively
with the Buyer Transaction Approval, the "Buyer Stockholder Approvals") to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Without

interests of the Buyer and its stockholders, (ii) directed that the Buyer
Voting Proposals be submitted to the stockholders of the Buyer for their

to any state takeover law or similar law that might otherwise apply to the
Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary (including the
approval of the Merger by the Buyer in its capacity as the sole stockholder
of the Transitory Subsidiary), subject only to the required receipt of the
Buyer Stockholder Approvals. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary and constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of each of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Buyer or
of the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary,
(ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or give rise to
a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
loss of any material benefit) under, require a consent or waiver under,
constitute a change in control under, require the payment of a penalty under
or result in the imposition of any Lien on the BuyerÂ’s or the Transitory
SubsidiaryÂ’s assets under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract or other agreement,
instrument or obligation to which the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be
bound, or (iii) subject to obtaining the Buyer Stockholder Approvals and
compliance with the requirements specified in clauses (i) through (ix) of
Section 4.3(c), conflict with or violate any permit, concession, franchise,
license, judgment, injunction, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule
or regulation applicable to the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary or any of
its or their properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) of this Section 4.3(b) for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or losses that,
individually or in the aggregate, may not reasonably be expected to have a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Buyer or
the Transitory Subsidiary or the consummation by the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i)
the pre-merger notification requirements under the HSR Act and compliance

series of the BuyerÂ’s capital stock or other securities necessary to obtain
the Buyer Transaction Approval and (ii) a majority of the shares of Buyer
Common Stock outstanding as of the record date for the Buyer Stockholders
Meeting is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the BuyerÂ’s
capital stock or other securities necessary to obtain the Buyer Charter
Approval, and such votes are the only votes of the holders of any class or
series of the BuyerÂ’s capital stock or other securities necessary for the
consummation by the Buyer of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the
Buyer having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,

Act. There are no off-balance sheet structures or transactions with respect
to the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries that would be required to be reported

the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration

Buyer shall promptly inform the Company of such fact or event.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Buyer maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.  Such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that
information the Buyer is required to disclose in reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the BuyerÂ’s management as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  The
Buyer has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal control
over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to the BuyerÂ’s auditors
and the Audit Committee of the BuyerÂ’s Board of Directors (A) any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the BuyerÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material,

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

### that involves management or other employees of the Buyer or
its Subsidiaries who have a significant role in the BuyerÂ’s internal control
over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2002, neither the Buyer nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Buyer, any director,
officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No attorney
representing the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Buyer
or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the BuyerÂ’s Board
of Directors or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the
Buyer.

### (e) The Buyer is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and with the applicable
listing and other rules and regulations of The Nasdaq National Market and has
not since January 1, 2002 received any notice from The Nasdaq National Market
asserting any non-compliance with such rules and regulations. Each required
form, report and document containing financial statements that the Buyer has
filed with or submitted to the SEC since August 29, 2002 was accompanied by
the certifications required to be filed or submitted by the BuyerÂ’s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer pursuant to the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and, at the time of filing or submission of each such
certification, such certification was true and accurate and complied with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
 Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including, without
limitation, Sections 13(k)(2) and (3), since the enactment of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, neither the Buyer nor any of its affiliates has made, arranged or
modified (in any material way) personal loans to any executive officer or
director of the Buyer.

Buyer SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since the date

circumstance, development or effect that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect.

  

## 

  

## 4.6 _Tax Matters_.  To the BuyerÂ’s knowledge, after consulting with its
independent auditors and tax advisors, neither the Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the
Merger from constituting a transaction qualifying as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code; provided that the Buyer shall not be in breach of
this representation if the Merger fails to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code by reason of the BuyerÂ’s failing to acquire
"control" of the Company for its voting stock as required by Section
368(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Code.

  

## 

  

## 4.7 _Operations of the Transitory Subsidiary_. The Transitory Subsidiary

activities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this
Agreement.

Buyer, Piper Jaffray and Co., has delivered to the Buyer an opinion dated the
date of this Agreement to the effect, as of such date, that the Merger
Consideration is fair to the Buyer from a financial point of view, a signed
copy of which opinion has been delivered to the Company.

# **ARTICLE VI 
  
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

  

# 

  

## 6.1 _No Solicitation_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as set forth in this
Section 6.1, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or
other advisors or representatives (such directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, other advisors and
representatives, collectively, "Representatives") to directly or indirectly:

  

### 

  

#### (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly or intentionally encourage, or take any
other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, including without limitation amending or granting any
waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to
any Company Common Stock; or

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any information with respect
to, assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any Person with respect
to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Acquisition Proposal
(provided, however, that providing notice of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.1 to a third party in response to any such inquiry, request or
Acquisition Proposal shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of this
Section 6.1).

  

#### 

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the approval of the principal terms
of the Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting (the "Specified Time"), the
Company may, to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the
Company Board, as determined in good faith by the Company Board
after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal made or received after the date of this
Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel and a nationally recognized independent financial
advisor is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, in each case
that did not result from a breach by the Company of, or actions by its
Representatives inconsistent with, this Section 6.1, and subject to
compliance with Section 6.1(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the
Company to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive of the other party than the Company Confidentiality Agreement and
(y) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.1(a) by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of
the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
6.1(a) by the Company.

  



  

### (b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

  

### 

  

#### (i) except as set forth in this Section 6.1, withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or
any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement (an "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement") constituting or

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to
in Section 6.1(a)); or

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal.

  

#### 

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may, in response to a
Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach by the Company of this
Section 6.1, withdraw or modify the recommendation by the Company Board or
any committee thereof of this Agreement and the Merger, if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that its
fiduciary obligations require it to do so, but only at a time that is prior
to the Specified Time and is after the third business day following the
BuyerÂ’s receipt of written notice advising the Buyer that the Company Board
desires to withdraw or modify the recommendation due to the existence of a
Superior Proposal (or any material change in the terms of such Superior
Proposal), specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (including any such material changes) and identifying the Person
making such Superior Proposal.  Such three business day period shall be
required for each and every Superior Proposal or modification thereto, as
applicable. Nothing in this Section 6.1 shall be deemed to (A) permit the
Company to take any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) of the first
sentence of this Section 6.1(b), or (B) affect any obligation of the Company
under this Agreement or (C) except upon a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(h), limit the CompanyÂ’s obligation to call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting, regardless of
whether the Company Board has withdrawn or modified its recommendation of
this Agreement and the Merger.

  



  

### (c) _Notices to the Buyer; Additional Negotiations_.  The Company shall
immediately advise the Buyer orally, with written confirmation to follow
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours), of any Acquisition Proposal or
any request for nonpublic information in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, or of any inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity
of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company
shall not provide any information to or participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person or entity making any Superior Proposal until
after the Company has first notified the Buyer of such Acquisition Proposal
as required by the preceding sentence. The Company shall (i) promptly
notify the Buyer if it has begun to furnish information to, or to participate
in discussions or negotiations with, a Person making any such Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry and shall immediately advise the Buyer orally, with
written confirmation to follow promptly (and in any event within 24 hours),
of any material change in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, (ii) provide to the Buyer as soon as practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent
or provided to the Company from any third party in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal and (iii) if the Buyer shall make a counterproposal
(including without limitation following delivery of a written notice to the
Buyer pursuant to Section 6.1(b)), consider and cause its financial and legal
advisors to consider in good faith the terms of such counterproposal.
 Contemporaneously with providing any correspondence, other
written materials or other information to a third party in connection with
any such Superior Proposal or

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

inquiry, the Company shall furnish a copy of such information to the Buyer
(to the extent not already previously provided).

  



  

### (d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section
6.1 or in Section 6.5 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position with respect to a tender offer
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any required disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable law.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease
immediately all discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

### 

  

"Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any inquiry, proposal or offer for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, tender offer, recapitalization, share exchange or
other business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) any proposal for the issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of over 20% of its equity securities (other than pursuant to any underwritten
or broadly distributed offering) or (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire
(including without limitation through any license) in any manner, directly or
indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or assets that constitute or
account for over 20% of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets
of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal made by a third
party (other than one made in response to any solicitation by the Company or
its Representatives that is in violation of or inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement) to acquire substantially all the equity securities or assets
of the Company, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a
consolidation or a sale of its assets, (i) on terms which the Company Board
determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable from a financial
point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement following consultation with a nationally
recognized independent financial advisor, taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by
the Buyer to amend the terms of this Agreement) and (ii) that in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board is reasonably capable of being completed
on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal
and other aspects of such proposal; provided, however, that no Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a Superior Proposal if any financing required
to consummate the Acquisition Proposal is not then committed unless in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board such financing is reasonably likely
to be committed.

government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Merger or any filing
pursuant to Section 6.2(b). Each of the Buyer and the Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible
for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under this Section
6.2 to comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event
occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any filing
pursuant to Section 6.2(b), the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be,
shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing

Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments,

other may reasonably request. Each of the Buyer and the Company will hold any

the Confidentiality Agreements. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section

  



  

49

the Buyer Voting Proposals by the stockholders of the Buyer and include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and (ii) neither the
Buyer Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose or
resolve to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company,

approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Buyer, after consultation with the Company, may adjourn or
postpone the Buyer Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure

antitrust laws or regulations, and any related governmental request

filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, accepting
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith.  The Company and the Buyer shall each use all commercially
reasonable efforts (subject to applicable law regarding the sharing of

all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any government clearances or
approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade and/or competition (collectively,
"Antitrust Laws"), to respond to any government requests for information
under any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any action, including any
legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an "Antitrust Order") that
restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law.
The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. The Buyer
shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any
Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall
afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to (i) make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for
the sale or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment
of a trust or otherwise) of any assets of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
or the Company or any of its Affiliates or the holding separate of the shares
of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or
imposing or seeking to impose any material limitation on the ability of the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to conduct their business or own such assets
or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of
Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or
(ii) take any action under this Section if the United States Department of
Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission, or any Governmental
Entity administering any other applicable Antitrust Law, authorizes its staff
to seek a preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation
of the Merger.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each of the Company and the Buyer shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any third party consents related to or required in
connection with the Merger that are (A) necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (B) disclosed or required to be disclosed
in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the
case may be, or (C) required to prevent the occurrence of an event that may
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect
prior to or after the Effective Time, it being understood that neither the

## 6.8 _Section 368(a) Reorganization_. The Buyer and the Company shall each
use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, provided
that neither party shall be in breach of this covenant if the Merger fails to
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code by reason of the
BuyerÂ’s failing to acquire "control" of the Company for its voting stock as
required by Section 368(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Code. The parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization.

  

## 

  

## 6.9 _Affiliate Legends_. Section 6.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a list of those Persons who are, in the CompanyÂ’s reasonable
judgment, "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145
promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule 145 Affiliates").  The Company
shall notify the Buyer in writing regarding any change in the identity of its
Rule 145 Affiliates prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall be entitled to
place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any shares of Buyer
Common Stock to be received by Rule 145 Affiliates of the Company in the
Merger reflecting the restrictions set forth in Rule 145 promulgated under
the Securities Act and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the
transfer agent for Buyer Common Stock (provided that such legends or stop
transfer instructions shall be removed upon the request of any holder of
shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in the Merger if (i) such request is made
more than one year after the Effective Time and (ii) such holder is not then
a Rule 145 Affiliate of the Buyer).

  

## 

  

## 6.10 _Nasdaq Stock Market Listing_. The Buyer shall, if required by the
rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, file with The Nasdaq Stock Market a

this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective Time, the
Company shall give the Buyer the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company or the Company
Board relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and shall not settle any such litigation without the BuyerÂ’s
prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

## 

  

## 6.12 _Indemnification_.

  

## 

  

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation, for a period of six
years from the Effective Time, to honor all of the CompanyÂ’s obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses
(including attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the extent that such obligations
to indemnify and hold harmless exist on the date of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain (to the extent available in the
market) in effect a directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy
covering those Persons who are currently covered by the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’
and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of
which has been delivered or made available to the Buyer prior to the date of
this Agreement) with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable to
such Persons as the CompanyÂ’s existing coverage; provided, that in no event
shall the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess
of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage.

  

### 

  

### (c) The provisions of this Section 6.12 are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. The Buyer shall guarantee the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation with respect to any and all amounts
payable under this Section 6.12.

## 6.13 _Employee Matters_. With respect to the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who remain employed after the Effective Time by the Company
or any Subsidiary for a period of at least 180 days following the Effective

terms of the BuyerÂ’s applicable benefit plans, the Buyer shall treat
and cause its applicable benefit plans to treat the service of the Continuing
Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
as service rendered to the Buyer or any affiliate of the Buyer for purposes
of eligibility to participate and vesting, including applicability of minimum
waiting periods for participation, but not for benefit accrual.  The Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that no such Continuing
Employee, or any of his or her eligible dependents, who, at the Effective
Time, are participating in the CompanyÂ’s group health plan shall be excluded
from the BuyerÂ’s group health plan, or limited in coverage thereunder, by
reason of any waiting period restriction or pre-existing
condition limitation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall not be
required to provide any coverage, benefits or credit inconsistent with the
terms of any Buyer benefit plans. Furthermore, nothing contained in this
Section 6.13 shall require or imply that the employment of the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed at the Effective Time will
continue for any particular period of time following the Effective Time. This
Section 6.13 is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights
or remedies upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of
employment with any Person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereunder.

  

## 

  

## 6.14 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Buyer shall give prompt notice
to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer, of
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or
failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause (a) (i) any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii)
any other representation or

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of the
Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary or the Company, as the case may be, or of
any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to
such partyÂ’s obligation to consummate the Merger.

  

## 

  

## 6.15 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 1_ _6(b)_.

### (a) The Board of Directors of the Buyer, or a committee thereof
consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of

the Effective Time providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of
Buyer Common Stock and cash in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
and of options to purchase Company Common Stock pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the
Section 16 Information, is intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under

information regarding the Company Insiders and the number of shares of
Company Common Stock or other Company equity securities deemed to be
beneficially owned by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged
for Buyer Common Stock and cash, in connection with the Merger, which shall
be provided by the Company to the Buyer within 10 business days after the
date of this Agreement.

true and correct (without regard to any

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained
therein), individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not be

warranties are specifically made as of a particular date, in which case such

opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be deemed satisfied if Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP renders such opinion to the Company (it
being agreed that the Buyer and the Company shall each provide
reasonable cooperation, including making reasonable representations, to DLA
Piper Rudnick Gray Cary US LLP or Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP,
as the case may be, to enable them to render such opinion).  This condition
shall be of no force or effect if the Control Test is not satisfied, as

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, telecopy, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or
other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until
it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to
this Agreement may change the address to which notices and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to
this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth.

  



  

## 9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules
and Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that
are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among
the parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them,
written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the
Confidentiality Agreements shall remain in effect in accordance with their
respective terms.

  

## 

  

## 9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.12
for Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be
deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to
create any agreement of employment with any Person or to otherwise create any
third-party beneficiary hereunder.

  

## 

  

## 9.5 _Assignment_.  No party may assign any of its rights or delegate any
of its performance obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be
null and void, except that the Transitory Subsidiary may assign this
Agreement to any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Buyer in lieu of the Transitory Subsidiary without consent of the Company,
provided that the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary shall remain liable for
all of the Transitory SubsidiaryÂ’s obligations under this Agreement.
 Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.  Any purported assignment
of rights or delegation of performance obligations in violation of this
Section 9.5 is void.

  

## 

  

## 9.6 _Severability_.  Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision
hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the

  



  

64   

     
   

  



  

parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or
to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the
parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve,
to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
invalid or unenforceable term.

  

## 

  

## 9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed
and delivered by facsimile transmission.

  

## 

  

## 9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section
of this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated.  The table of contents, table
of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their
mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against
any party. Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this
Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter
forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural,
and vice versa. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute
or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.  Whenever the words
"include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". No summary of this
Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 9.9 _Governing Law_.  All matters arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without
limitation its interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement)
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of
the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions
other than those of the State of Delaware.

  

## 

  

## 9.10 _Remedies_.  Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached.  It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this

  



  

65   

     
   

  



  

Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

  

## 

  

## 9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement
(a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c)
agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not
to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any
other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives
any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party
with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the
address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.2.
Nothing in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

  

## 

  

## 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE BUYER, THE TRANSITORY
SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE BUYER, THE TRANSITORY
SUBSIDIARY OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  

## 

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company have
caused this Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto
duly authorized as of the date first written above.
