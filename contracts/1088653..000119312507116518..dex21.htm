ARTICLE 2

_THE MERGER_

Section 2.01 _The Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at
5:30 a.m., San Francisco time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event,
within two (2) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 9,
unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The
Closing shall be held at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom
LLP, 525 University Avenue, Suite 1100, Palo Alto, California 94301,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

Section 2.02 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, as soon as
practicable after the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing this Agreement or a certificate
of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Certificate of Merger"), in such form as is required hereby, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of Delaware Law.

(b) The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as
the Certificate of Merger have been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State (or at such later time as may be agreed to by the parties and specified
in the Certificate of Merger).

(c) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges
and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities,
restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as
provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.03 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.03(b), Section 2.03(c) or
Section 2.05, each Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (together with the Company Rights attached to each such share)
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration;



 

9 (b) each Company Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (together
with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be canceled, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto;

(c) each Company Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent
(other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective
Time (together with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be
converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation
such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned
in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and (in
addition to shares referred to in Section 2.03(c)) shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.04 _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing Company
Shares (the "Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated Company Shares (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall make available
to the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
record holder of Company Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal
and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent)
for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) in the case of certificated
Company Shares, surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) in the case of
Uncertificated Shares, receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.



 

10 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by holders of Company Shares six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any
such holder who has not exchanged Company Shares for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Shares two (2)
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such
time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a) in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall
be returned to Parent, upon demand.

Section 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.03, any
Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together
with the Company Rights attached to each such share) (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption
of this Agreement or the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
validly has demanded the appraisal value of such Company Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of Delaware Law shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses its dissenters rights; _provided_ that if, after
the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its
dissenters rights pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law, such Company
Shares (together with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The
Company shall provide Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, and
any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the
Company with respect to the Merger received by the Company, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to each such dissent. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such dissent.



 

11 Section 2.06 _Company Stock Options; ESPP_.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") outstanding under the
Companys 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, as amended, the Companys
Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan or any other stock option or
equity compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement (the "Company
Stock Plans") other than the Cashed Out Stock Options (the "Assumed Stock
Options") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed and converted
automatically at the Effective Time into an option to acquire shares of Parent
Stock, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
such Assumed Stock Option (including vesting schedule) and any repurchase
rights with respect to unvested shares subject to such Assumed Stock Option
shall be assigned to any successor thereto, including without limitation,
Parent, except that (i) the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each
such option shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time by a fraction (the "Option Exchange Ratio"), the numerator
of which is the Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the
average closing price of Parent Stock on the Nasdaq over the five (5) trading
days immediately preceding (but not including) the Closing Date (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable
pursuant to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
_divided by_ (y) the Option Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Company Stock Option that (i) is held by a person who is not an employee
of the Company or any Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time or,
as reasonably determined by Parent in its sole discretion, is held by a person
who will not be a service provider of the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of
the foregoing immediately following the Effective Time and (ii) Parent
determines shall not be treated as an Assumed Stock Option (the "Cashed Out
Stock Options") shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be accelerated
in full so that each such option is fully vested and exercisable and shall be
cancelled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise of such Cashed Out Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (y) the Merger Consideration, less the per share exercise price of
such option.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) with respect to outstanding Company Restricted Shares
shall be retained by Parent for the benefit of the holder of such Company
Restricted Shares, subject to the same restrictions and vesting arrangements
that were applicable to such Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Such Merger Consideration shall be paid to such holder on
the date or dates that such Company Restricted Shares would have become vested
under the vesting schedule in place for such Company Restricted Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the satisfaction of
restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule). All outstanding rights
to repurchase Company Restricted Shares that the Company may hold (or  



 

12  similar restrictions in the Companys favor, including, but not limited to,
the forfeiture restrictions applicable to the Company Restricted
Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assigned by the
Surviving Corporation to Parent in the Merger and shall thereafter be
exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such rights
may be exercised by Parents retaining the cash into which such Company
Restricted Shares have been converted and paying to the former holder thereof
the repurchase price (if any) applicable for each share subject to such right
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its reasonable
best efforts (which shall not include making any payment to any holder of a
Company Stock Option) to obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock
Options, and (ii) have any resolutions passed by the Company Board or make
any amendments to the terms of such Company Stock Options or Company Stock
Plans, in each case, that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.06. Without limitation of the foregoing, the
Company Board shall take such actions as are necessary to cause any Company
Stock Options which would become vested solely as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with their terms unless otherwise determined
by the Company Board, not to become vested solely as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Assumed Stock Options and the cancellation and cashout of the Cashed Out Stock
Options pursuant to this Section 2.06, including with respect to the Assumed
Stock Options, the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as
is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.06. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject to the Assumed
Stock Options as soon as practicable (and in any event within fifteen (15)
Business Days) following the Effective Time and use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement covering such
Company Stock Options for so long as such Assumed Stock Options remain
outstanding. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of
Parent Stock, when issued upon exercise of such Assumed Stock Options, to be
approved for quotation on the Nasdaq.

(e) The Company shall cause the administrator of the ESPP to promptly take all
action necessary in accordance with the ESPP to accelerate the Purchase Date
(as defined in the ESPP) with respect to the current offering period under the
ESPP such that each outstanding purchase right with respect to the current
offering period under the ESPP (each, a "Purchase Right") shall
be exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall
take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the ESPP in order to (i)
ensure that no offering periods under the ESPP commence after the date hereof,
(ii) permit participants in the ESPP to exercise, effective as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Purchase Rights existing immediately prior to
the Effective Time to acquire shares of Company Common Stock at the purchase
price applicable to the current offering period and (iii) refund to
participants in the ESPP the funds that remain in the participants accounts
after such purchase. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall terminate the ESPP.



 

13 Section 2.07 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a
record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.08 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of any Tax law. Any amounts withheld shall be
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority. If the Exchange Agent,
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts and
pays such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authorities, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.09 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated under this Article 2.

ARTICLE 3

_THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

Section 3.01 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation
of the Company shall be amended at the Effective Time as set forth in _Exhibit
B_ and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

Section 3.02 _Bylaws_. The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until amended in accordance with Applicable Law.



 

14 Section 3.03 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and
(ii) the officers of the Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE 4

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Subject to Section 11.05, except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary
that:

Section 4.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law
and has all corporate powers required to carry on its business as now
conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except
for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as currently in effect. The Company has heretofore made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of the minutes (or, in the case of draft
minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of the stockholders
of the Company, the Company Board and each committee of the Company Board and
the Boards of Directors and each committee thereof each of the Companys
Subsidiaries held since January 1, 2004; _provided_  that, with respect to
meetings for which draft or final minutes are not yet available, the Company
has provided to Parent a materially complete and correct summary thereof.

Section 4.02 _Corporate Authorization_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
are within the Companys corporate powers and, except for obtaining
the Stockholder Approval, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Shares voting to approve and
adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the "Stockholder Approval") is the only
vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law affecting creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity.

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, at which all directors of the Company were present, the Companys
Board of Directors duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) declaring that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in
the best interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii) approving and declaring
advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other  



 

15  transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) approving and adopting an amendment
to the Company Rights Agreement to render the Company Rights inapplicable
to the Merger, this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, (iv) directing that the adoption of this
Agreement be submitted to the Stockholder Meeting, and (v) making the Board
Recommendation. 

Section 4.03 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which
the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable
requirements of (A) the HSR Act and (B) any Applicable Law analogous to
the HSR Act or otherwise regulating antitrust, competition or merger control
matters and in each case existing in foreign jurisdictions ("Foreign
Competition Laws"), (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the
1933 Act, the 1934 Act and any other applicable U.S. state or federal
securities laws, (iv) any actions or filings the absence of which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and (v) any actions or filings with respect to which
the Company has no knowledge as of the date of this Agreement and which become
applicable as a result of the business or activities in which Parent or any of
its affiliates is engaged. 

Section 4.04 _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene,
conflict with, or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any
Applicable Law or Order, (iii) require any consent or other action by
any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or cause or
permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any
right or obligation or the loss of any benefit under, any provision of any
Contract binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Governmental Authorization that, to the Companys knowledge, affects or
relates in any way to, the assets or business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with such exceptions, in the
case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect; _provided_ that in determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect would result, any adverse effect otherwise excluded by clause (A) of
the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be taken into
account.

Section 4.05  _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (of which 200,000 shares have been designated
as Series A Preferred Stock and reserved for issuance upon exercise of the
Company Rights). As of the close of

 



 

16  business on May 11, 2007, (i) 59,290,240 Company Shares were issued and
outstanding (none of which were held by the Company as treasury shares), (ii)
no shares of preferred stock of the Company were issued and outstanding, (iii)
Company Stock Options to purchase an aggregate of 7,916,831 Company Shares
were issued and outstanding (of which Company Stock Options to purchase
an aggregate of 6,264,635 Company Shares were exercisable), and (iv) an
aggregate of 6,612,642 Company Shares were reserved for issuance under the
ESPP. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been, and
all shares that may be issued pursuant to any Company Stock Plan or the ESPP
will be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly
authorized and validly issued and are (or, in the case of shares that have not
yet been issued, will be) fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

(b) Section 4.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
close of business on May 11, 2007, a complete and correct list of all
outstanding Company Stock Options, including with respect to each such option,
the number of shares subject to such option, the name of the holder, the grant
date, the exercise price per share and the expiration date of each such
option and whether the option is an "incentive stock option" under Section 422
of the Code or a non-qualified stock option. The Company has made available to
Parent complete and accurate copies of all forms of Company Stock Option
grant agreements pursuant to which such options were granted. The Company
Stock Plans set forth on Section 4.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
are the only plans or programs the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
maintained under which stock options, restricted shares, restricted share
units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares or other compensatory
equity-based awards have been or may be granted. No Assumed Stock Options or
Company Restricted Shares shall become vested or exercisable, and the
Companys right to repurchase the shares subject to Company Restricted Shares
or issued upon the exercise of Assumed Stock Options shall not be forfeited,
in either case, solely as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for changes since May 11,
2007 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding on such
date and disclosed on Section 4.05(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
there are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or voting securities of
the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company, (iii)

reasonably sufficient in all material respects to provide
reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (ii) that
receipts and expenditures are executed in accordance with the authorization of
management, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
would materially affect the Companys financial statements. No significant

20 (c) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the 1934 Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that (i) all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to the individuals
responsible for preparing such reports within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) all such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company
required under the 1934 Act with respect to such reports.

(d) Since January 1, 2004, neither the present chief executive officer nor the
chief financial officer of the Company has become aware of any fact,
circumstance or change that is reasonably likely to result in a "significant
deficiency" or a "material weakness" in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting that has not already been expressly disclosed as being
reasonably likely to have such a result in the Company SEC Documents.

(e) The audit committee of the Company Board includes an Audit Committee
Financial Expert, as defined by Item 401(h)(2) of Regulation S-K.

performing similar functions. The Company has promptly disclosed any change
in or waiver of the Companys code of ethics with respect to any such persons,
as required by Section 406(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the knowledge of
the Company, there have been no violations of provisions of the Companys
code of ethics by any such persons.

requirements of the 1934 Act. The representations and warranties contained in
this Section 4.09(a) will not apply to statements or omissions included in
the Proxy Statement based upon information furnished to the Company in writing
by Parent specifically for use therein.

(b) The Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, at the
time such Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first
mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time such stockholders vote
on adoption of this Agreement, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties contained
in this Section 4.09(b) will not apply to statements or omissions included in
the Proxy Statement based upon information furnished to the Company in writing
by Parent specifically for use therein.

Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) there has not been any action or event,
nor any authorization, commitment or agreement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any action or event, that if taken or if it
occurred after the date hereof would be prohibited by Section 6.01(b)(i),
(ii), (iii)(B), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (ix), (x), (xiv) and (xv) as it
relates to the foregoing clauses).

(b) Since the Company Balance Sheet Date and through the date hereof, none of
the Company and its Subsidiaries has engaged, except in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, in (i) any trade loading
practices or any other promotional sales or discount activity with any
customers or distributors with any intent of accelerating to prior fiscal
quarters (including the current fiscal quarter) sales to the trade or
otherwise that would otherwise be expected to occur in subsequent fiscal
quarters, (ii) any practice which would have the effect of modifying the
fiscal quarter during which collections of receivables or payments by the

payments occur during a fiscal quarter other than as would be expected based
on past practice or (iii) any other promotional sales or discount activity.

Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no
Proceeding pending or threatened against any of the directors or employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its stockholders or
Representatives (in each case insofar as any such



 

22  matters relate to their activities with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Order against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or naming the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a party
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Companys knowledge, there is no
Order which prohibits or restricts any of the employees or representatives of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from engaging in or otherwise
conducting the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as presently
conducted that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law and Orders_.

(a) Except as would not result in material liability or otherwise be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
is and, since January 1, 2004 has been, in compliance in all respects with
all Applicable Laws and Orders, and to the Companys knowledge, no condition
or state of facts exists that is reasonably likely to give rise to a violation
of, or a liability or default under, any Applicable Law or Order. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice since
January 1, 2004 (x) of any administrative, civil or criminal investigation or
audit (other than Tax audits) by any Governmental Authority relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (y) from any Governmental
Authority alleging that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are not in
compliance in any material respect with any Applicable Law or Order, in the
case of each of (x) and (y), that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has in effect all material
Governmental Authorizations necessary for it to own, lease or otherwise hold
and to operate its properties and assets and to carry on its businesses and
operations as now conducted. There have occurred no defaults (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) under, violations of, or events giving rise
to any right of termination, amendment or cancellation of any such
Governmental Authorizations except as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

promptly as practicable after the date hereof, for the purpose of voting on
the matters requiring the Stockholder Approval; provided that (i) if the
Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its stockholders at such time, the
Company may extend the date of the Stockholder Meeting by no more than five
(5) Business Days and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts during
such five (5) Business Day period to obtain such a quorum as soon
as practicable, and (ii) the Company may delay the Stockholder Meeting to the
extent (and only to the extent) the Company reasonably determines that such
delay is required by Applicable Law to comply with any comments made by the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or otherwise. Subject to Section
6.03(b), the Company Board shall make the Board Recommendation and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Stockholder Approval, and the Company
shall otherwise comply with all Applicable Laws applicable to the Stockholder
Meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Stockholder Meeting and the matters constituting the Stockholder Approval
shall be submitted to the Companys stockholders at the Stockholder Meeting
whether or not (A) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, or
(B) any Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or announced
or otherwise submitted to the Company or any of its Representatives.

favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger (the "Board Recommendation") at the Stockholders Meeting; (ii) the
Proxy Statement shall include the Board Recommendation; and (iii) neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw,
amend or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent, the Board Recommendation.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company and Parent
shall prepare jointly and the Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement and as soon as practicable thereafter use its reasonable best
efforts to mail to its stockholders the Proxy Statement and all other proxy
materials for such meeting, and if necessary in order to comply with
applicable securities laws, after the Proxy Statement shall have been so
mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy
material, and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies.
Subject to Section 6.03(b), the Proxy Statement shall contain the Board
Recommendation. The Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all
information concerning the Company or Parent as the other party hereto may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of the Proxy Statement. Parent and  



 

43  its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Proxy Statement before such document (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall include in
such document any comments reasonably proposed by Parent and its counsel. The

Section 6.03 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their
Representatives to, and the Company shall instruct, and cause each applicable
Subsidiary, if any, to instruct, each such Representative not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or
encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or the making of any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, or, subject to Section 6.03(b), (i) conduct or engage in
any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage
any effort by, any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) (A) amend or grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) approve any
transaction under, or any Third Party becoming an "interested stockholder"
under, Section 203 of Delaware Law, or (C) amend or grant any waiver or

contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) enter into any agreement in
principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Subject to Section
6.03(b), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall fail to
make, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary,
the Board Recommendation, or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, fail to
recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the
Company Shares within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such
offer, or make any public statement inconsistent with the Board
Recommendation, or resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any
of the foregoing, an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be terminated,
and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their
Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in
possession of non public information in respect of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such
information.



 

44 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative, may (i)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that has made (and
not withdrawn) a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in writing
that the Company Board believes in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such
Third Party non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidential
Disclosure Agreement dated as of September 14, 2006 between the Company and
Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and containing additional provisions
that expressly permit the Company to comply with the terms of this Section
6.03 (a copy of which confidentiality agreement shall be promptly (in all
events within 24 hours) provided for informational purposes only to Parent),
(iii) following receipt of and on account of a Superior Proposal, make an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (iv) take any action that any court
of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take (which order remains
unstayed), but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iv), only if the Company Board determines in good faith by a majority vote,
after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board
from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal, so long as any action taken or statement
made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.03.

(c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses
(i) through (iv) of the preceding subsection unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after it obtains knowledge of the receipt by the Company
(or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, any request
for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party. In such notice,
the Company shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and
conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the
status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price
and other material terms thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with at
least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board
(or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board) at
which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with any non-public
information concerning the Companys business, present or future performance,
financial condition or results of operations, provided to any Third Party that
was not previously provided to Parent.

(d) In addition, the Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change, unless (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least
five (5) Business Days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change, of its
intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, (ii) the
Company attaches to such notice the  



 

45  most current version of such proposed agreement or a detailed summary of all
material terms of any such proposal (which version shall be updated on a
prompt basis) and the identity of the offeror, and (iii) Parent does not
make, within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of that written
notification, an offer that is determined by the Company Board in good faith,
after consulting with its outside counsel and financial advisor to be at
least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal.

Section 6.04 _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall (i) give
to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the
offices, properties, books, records, Contracts, Governmental Authorizations,
documents, directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to Parent and
its Representatives such financial and operating data and other information
as such Persons may reasonably request (including the work papers of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP), and (iii) instruct its Representatives to
cooperate with Parent and its Representatives in its investigation;
_provided_ that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent
that any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or prohibit access to
any such properties or information, or such disclosure would, based on
the advice of such partys counsel, that such disclosure would be reasonably
likely to result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or any other applicable privilege applicable to such information. Any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be conducted in such manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 6.05 _Notice of Certain Events_.

(a) In connection with integration planning with respect to the operation of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, subject to Applicable Law,
the executive officers of the Company, including but not limited to the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company, shall use good faith efforts to
consult with Parent on a regular basis, as reasonably requested by Parent, to
report material operational developments, material developments with respect
to the status of, including without limitation the material adverse
modification to, relationships with customers, partners, suppliers, licensors,
licensees, distributors and others having material business relationships with
the Company and other matters reasonably requested by Parent.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of:

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any Proceeding commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the  



 

46  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to Sections 4.12, 4.13, 4.15 or 4.16, as the case may be,
or that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

(iv) any notice or other communication from any Major Customer or Major
Supplier that such Major Customer or Major Supplier is terminating its
relationship with Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(v) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions set forth in Section 9.02(a) not to be
satisfied; and

(vi) any failure of the Company to perform its obligations contained in this
Agreement that could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth
in Section 9.02(b) not to be satisfied.

Section 6.06 _Company Rights Agreement_. The Company Board shall take all
further actions (in addition to those referred to in Section 4.26(b))
reasonably requested by Parent in order to render the Company Rights
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger.

Section 6.07 _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. Unless otherwise directed in
writing by Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will terminate any and all Employee Plans intended to
qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of
the Code, effective as of the day immediately preceding the date the Company
becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in
Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent. The Company shall provide Parent
evidence that such resolutions to terminate the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been adopted by the Company Board or the board of
directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent. The
Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any
such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably request. Immediately prior to such
termination, the Company will make (or cause to be made) all necessary
payments to fund the contributions (i) necessary or required to maintain the
tax-qualified status of any such 401(k) Plan, (ii) for elective deferrals made
pursuant to any such 401(k) Plan for the period prior to termination, and
(iii) for employer matching contributions (if any) for the period prior to
termination.

use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent and its
Representatives with respect to  



 

47  their review of the Company Software Products and to take actions consistent
with those described on Schedule 6.09 hereto; provided that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no failure to
have satisfied this Section 6.09 prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed
to constitute a failure of the condition to the Merger set forth in Section
9.02(b) to be satisfied; provided further that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, no information arising out of or relating to
the matters set forth in this Section 6.09 shall be deemed to constitute a

ARTICLE 7

_COVENANTS OF PARENT_

Parent agrees that:

Section 7.01 _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_. Parent shall cause Merger
Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 7.02 _Director and Officer Liability_. 

(a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") as provided
in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement (copies of which have been
made available to Parent prior to the date hereof) shall be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the
Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to comply with and honor the foregoing obligations;
_provided_ that such obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed
from time to time under Applicable Law.

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain officers
and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time (including as contemplated by this Agreement)
covering each such Indemnified Person currently covered by the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof (the "DandO Insurance"); _provided_ that in satisfying its
obligation under this Section 7.02(b), the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in respect of its current fiscal year (the "Annual Premium Cap"),
which amount is set forth in Section 7.02(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; _provided further_ that if such insurance cannot be so maintained or
obtained at such cost, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain or obtain as much of such insurance as
can be so maintained or obtained at an annual cost equal to the Annual Premium
Cap. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid
policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions that are equivalent to
those of the DandO Insurance so  



 

48  long as the amount paid for such tail policy does not exceed the Annual
Premium Cap. In the event that the Company shall purchase such a
"tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this Section 7.02(b) for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.02.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under the Delaware Law or any other Applicable Laws or under any agreement of
any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The rights
of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall survive consummation
of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this Section 7.02 shall not be terminated or modified in such manner as
to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom this Section 7.02 applies,
without the consent of such Indemnified Person.

Section 7.03 _Employee Benefits_. From and after the Closing Date, with
respect to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before
the Effective Time who continue employment with the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time
("Continuing Employees"), Parent shall cause the service of each
such Continuing Employee with the Company and its ERISA Affiliates prior to
the Closing Date to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate
and vesting (but not for any other purpose, including, without limitation, for
purposes of benefit accrual or determination of levels of benefits) under
each compensation, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan, program or
arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their ERISA
Affiliates, but not including any sabbatical or equity compensation plans,
programs, agreements or arrangements (collectively, the "Parent Benefit
Plans") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate, but solely to the extent service was credited to such employee
for such purposes under a comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior
to the Closing Date. From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each
Parent Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible
to participate, Parent shall cause each such Parent Benefit Plan to (i) waive
all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods and
exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
under such Parent Benefit Plan to the same extent that such pre-existing
conditions, waiting periods and exclusions would not have applied or would
have been waived under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to his commencement of
participation in such Parent Benefit Plan but, with respect to long-term
disability and life insurance benefits and coverage, solely to the extent
permitted  



 

49  under the terms and conditions of Parents applicable insurance contracts in
effect as of the Closing Date (for purposes of clarity, to the extent
such benefit coverage includes eligibility conditions based on periods of
employment, the first sentence of this Section 7.03 shall control) and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid by such Continuing Employee in the calendar year that, and
prior to the date that, such Continuing Employee commences participation in
such Parent Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment or deductible
requirements under such Parent Benefit Plan for the applicable calendar year.
Effective as of the Closing Date, Parent shall assume (or shall cause any
successor to the Company to assume) absolutely and unconditionally the
Companys Executive Retention and Severance Plan, as amended, and the
Companys Vice President Retention and Severance Plan, and shall agree to
perform the Companys obligations under such plans in the same manner and to
the same extent as the Company would be required to perform had no such
succession taken place.

correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their respective

Subsidiaries be obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of any
Proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental
Authority or appeal any Order (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal,
delay materially or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit the

Agreement or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries any
damages in connection therewith, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any
respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by
the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates of all or any
portion of the business, assets or any product of the Company or any of its

Person to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or
nonexclusive license) or enter into a consent decree or hold separate all or
any portion of the business, assets or any product of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as a
result of or in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) seeking, directly or indirectly, to
impose or confirm limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any

parties to any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) in taking such
actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required in

steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section

Proposal; or

other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

Section 11.03 _Amendments and Waivers_.

the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement
or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 11.04 _Expenses_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
cost or expense; _provided_ that the Company and Parent shall share equally
all (i) all fees and expenses, other than attorneys and accountants fees and

available funds), within two (2) Business Days after such termination, a fee
in an amount equal to $16,400,000 (the "Termination Fee").

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), then the

pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i)) or the Stockholder Meeting (in the case of
termination pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii)), an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly made, and (ii) within twelve (12) months following the date
of such termination the Company shall have (A) entered into a  



 

58  definitive agreement with respect to, (B) recommended to its stockholders,

Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), within one (1)
Business Day after entering into such definitive agreement, making such

Agreement, but in no event more than $5,000,000 (the "Parent Expenses") as
directed by Parent in writing; _provided_ that the amount of any payment of
the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 11.04(e) shall be credited
against any obligation of the Company to pay the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 11.04(d).

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
11.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Subsidiary would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay any amount
due to Parent pursuant to this Section 11.04, when due, the Company shall
pay the costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection
with any action taken to collect payment (including the prosecution of any
lawsuit or other legal action), together with interest on the unpaid amount at

Section 11.05  _Disclosure Schedule References_. The parties hereto agree
that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule

for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the Company that are contained in the corresponding Section of
this Agreement, and (ii) any other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in this

respect thereto, and no employee or other Person is or is intended to be a
third-party beneficiary thereof.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other
party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time
in part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time; _provided_ that such
transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any
of its obligations hereunder.

Section 11.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such State.

Section 11.08 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any
Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without
limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such
party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

Section 11.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by each other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

Section 11.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Voting
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, between the parties with respect to their subject matter.



 

60 Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof

court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.
