Effective Time, the Share Consideration shall be issued in the name of the
Depositary (for the account of the Shareholders). Any shares subject to
restriction under a Lock-up Agreement shall be held by the Depositary until
the respective dates upon which such Share Consideration is no longer subject
to restriction under the corresponding Lock-up Agreement (the release date of
such Share Consideration, the "Release Date"). The Depositary shall release to
the applicable Shareholders the Share Consideration on their applicable
Release Date.

thereof, without any further act or formality on its part, free and clear of
all Encumbrances, to Acquisition Sub in consideration for a debt claim against
Acquisition Sub in an amount determined and payable in accordance with the
terms of the Plan of Arrangement, and the name of such holder will be removed
from the register of holders of Target Shares (in respect of the Target Shares
for which Dissent Rights have been validly exercised in accordance with the
Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement), and Acquisition Sub shall be
recorded as the registered holder of the Target Shares so transferred and
shall be deemed to be the  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 29 -   legal and beneficial owner of such Target Shares free and clear of any
Encumbrances; 

---|--- 



     | (b) | each Target Share (other than Target Shares in respect of
which Dissent Rights have been validly exercised in accordance with the
Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement) shall be transferred and deemed to
be transferred by the registered holder thereof, without any further act or
formality on its part, free and clear of all Encumbrances, to Acquisition Sub
in consideration of the payment of the Cash Consideration and the Share
Consideration to the Depositary (on behalf of the Shareholders), the payment
of the Escrow Amounts and the Representative Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent
(on behalf of the Shareholders), and the right, if any, to receive a pro rata
portion of the Earn-out Amount as set forth in this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, and the right, if any, to receive a pro
rata portion of any post-Effective Time adjustments to the consideration
as set forth in Section 2.21(c) and the Plan of Arrangement, and the name of
such holder will be removed from the register of holders of Target Shares, and
Acquisition Sub shall be recorded as the registered holder of Target Shares so
transferred and shall be deemed to be the legal and beneficial owner of such
Target Shares free and clear of any Encumbrances; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Acquisition Sub shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, on
behalf of the Shareholders, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
the Escrow Indemnity Amount and the Escrow Tax Amount, with each such amount
to be held in a segregated interest-bearing account (the "Indemnity Escrow
Account" and the "Tax Escrow Account," respectively, and, each, an
"Escrow Account" and, collectively, the "Escrow Accounts"), for the purposes
of (i) with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Account, securing the obligations
to pay any post-closing adjustment amount pursuant to Section 2.21(c) and any
indemnification obligations set forth in Sections 10.2(a)(ii), (iii) and (iv)
and (ii) with respect to the Tax Escrow Account, securing the obligations to
pay any indemnification obligations set forth in Sections 10.2(a)(v),
pursuant to the terms set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Acquisition Sub shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, on
behalf of the Shareholders, the Representative Escrow Amount, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, such amount to be held in a segregated

Representative Expenses, pursuant to the terms set forth in this Agreement
and in the Escrow Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

the Depositary shall distribute to each Shareholder in respect of the Target
Shares held by him, her or it immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Target Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 30 -   exercised in accordance with the Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement)
an amount of the Aggregate Cash Consideration equal to the number of such
Target Shares held multiplied by the Cash Consideration and an amount of the
Aggregate Share Consideration equal to the number of such Target Shares held
multiplied by the Share Consideration, in each case in accordance with the
terms of the Plan of Arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Aggregate Cash Consideration equals the entire amount of the Aggregate Initial
Consideration, then there shall be no Aggregate Share Consideration and no
Share Consideration. 

---|--- 
 

Each Escrow Amount and the Representative Escrow Amount shall be held in
segregated escrow accounts to be maintained separately as trust funds and
shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other
judicial process of any creditor of any party to this Agreement, and shall be
held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Plan of Arrangement and the Escrow Agreement. The
accounts held by the Depositary and the Escrow Agent in connection with this
Agreement shall be delivered to them and held by them in Canadian accounts
and, subject to the written approval and direction of the Shareholder
Representative (provided, that with respect to each Escrow Account, such
amounts shall remain in United States dollars unless Acquisition Sub otherwise
consents in writing), denominated in United States dollars and/or Canadian
dollars (and, as applicable, with such funds to be converted from United
States dollars to Canadian dollars at such conversion rates as the Shareholder
Representative (and, with respect to an Escrow Account, Acquisition Sub) may
approve in writing at any time after the date hereof).

pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, the Shareholders who receive Cash

Earn-out Amount, if and when due and payable, shall be paid by Acquisition Sub
to the Depositary (on behalf of the Shareholders) in cash or shares of Common
Stock or a combination thereof in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement and
the Depositary shall distribute to the Shareholders in respect of the Target
Shares held by them immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Target Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly exercised
in accordance with the Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement) the Earn-out
Amount to which such Shareholders are entitled in accordance with the terms
of the Plan of Arrangement.



   2.11 | Earn-Out Report 
---|--- 
 

Acquisition Sub shall deliver, as soon as practicable and in any event not
later than 5:00 p.m. EST on the date that is 75 days following the last day

following receipt of the Earn-out Report, notifies Acquisition Sub in writing
that it objects to the computation of Revenue or EBITDA of Target set forth in
the Earn-out Report, the Earn-out Report shall be deemed accepted by the
Shareholder

 



\- 31 -   Representative, and will be binding and conclusive for all purposes of the
Earn-out Provisions. The Shareholder Representative may make inquiries of
Parent and its accountants and appropriate employees regarding questions
concerning or disagreements with the Earn-out Report arising in the course of
its review thereof, and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause any such
employees and accountants to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries in
a timely manner (subject to the Shareholder Representative entering into any
confidentiality and other agreements reasonably required by the accountants).
Acquisition Sub shall also prepare and deliver to the Shareholder
Representative reasonably detailed updates regarding progress with respect to
the Targets at the same time as Parent prepares its quarterly financial
statements; _provided_ , that such updates shall have no bearing or effect on
the Earn-out Report or the Earn-out Period Income Statement and the
Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders) acknowledges and
agrees that such updates are not binding in any way.

 



   2.12 | Objections to Earn-Out Report; Arbitrating Accountants 
---|--- 

If the Shareholder Representative objects to the computation of Revenue or
EBITDA set forth in the Earn-out Report by providing the appropriate notice in
accordance with Section 11.4 by the deadline provided in Section 2.11, then
the amount of Revenue or EBITDA for the Earn-out Period shall be determined by
good faith negotiation between the Shareholder Representative and Acquisition
Sub. Any such notice of objection shall specify in reasonable detail those
items or amounts as to which the Shareholder Representative disagrees and
shall specify the Shareholder Representatives proposed adjustment(s) to the
calculations of Revenue and EBITDA. The Shareholder Representative shall be
deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Earn-
out Report. If Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder Representative are unable
to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after such notification, then
the determination of the amount of Revenue or EBITDA for the Earn-out Period
shall be promptly submitted to the Arbitrating Accountants, whose
determination shall be (i) in writing, (ii) furnished to the Shareholder
Representative and Acquisition Sub as soon as practicable (and in no event
later than thirty (30) days after submission of the dispute to the Arbitrating
Accountants), (iii) made in accordance with the preparation of the Earn-out
Period Income Statement, subject to the exceptions set forth in the Earn-out
Provisions, and (iv) nonappealable and incontestable by the Shareholder
Representative, the Shareholders, Acquisition Sub and each of their respective
Affiliates and successors and assigns and not subject to collateral attack
for any reason other than manifest error or fraud. In making any such
determination, the Arbitrating Accountants shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Earn-out Report as to which Acquisition Sub and
the Shareholder Representative have disagreed (and the Arbitrating
Accountants determination of EBITDA or Revenue (or any item in the
determination thereof) shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in the
Earn-out Report or more than the amount thereof shown in the Shareholder
Representatives notice of objection). The fees and expenses of the
Arbitrating Accountants shall be allocated between the Shareholder
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders), on the one hand,
and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the disputed Revenue or EBITDA amount submitted to the
Arbitrating Accountants that is unsuccessfully disputed by the Shareholder
Representative (as ultimately determined by the Arbitrating Accountants)
bears to the total amount of such disputed Revenue or EBITDA amount so
submitted; _provided_ , that if the Arbitrating Accountants require a retainer
or other upfront payment, then the Shareholder Representative and Parent
shall each initially pay one-half of such amount (with a true up upon the
final

 



\- 32 -   determination of the Arbitrating Accountants). Each of the Shareholder
Representative and Parent agrees to use its respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Arbitrating Accountants and to cause the
Arbitrating Accountants to resolve any dispute no later than thirty (30) days
after submission of the dispute to the Arbitrating Accountants in accordance
with the Earn-out Provisions.

 



   2.13 | Additional Purchase Price 
---|--- 
 

Any Earn-out Amount paid or delivered to the Depositary (on behalf of the
Shareholders) will be treated by the Parties and the Shareholders as
additional purchase price for the Target Shares under this Agreement.



   2.14 | Calculation of Earn-out Amount 
---|--- 

Subject to reduction as set forth in Article 10:



     | (a) | If the Target recognizes (i) at least $34,000,000 in
Revenue; and (ii) at least $4,000,000 in EBITDA during the Earn-out Period,
then the Earn-out Amount shall be an amount equal to $15,000,000 multiplied
by the Dissent Fraction, unless a higher Earn-out Amount is earned herein. For
the avoidance of doubt, if Revenue is less than $34,000,000 or if EBITDA is
less than $4,000,000 during the Earn-out Period, then no Earn-out Amount
shall be due. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If the Target recognizes (i) at least $36,000,000 in
Revenue; and (ii) at least $4,750,000 in EBITDA during the Earn-out Period,
then the Earn-out Amount shall be an amount equal to $20,000,000 multiplied
by the Dissent Fraction, unless a higher Earn-out Amount is earned herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | If the Target recognizes (i) at least $38,000,000 in
Revenue; and (ii) at least $5,500,000 in EBITDA during the Earn-out Period,
then the Earn-out Amount shall be an amount equal to $25,000,000 multiplied
by the Dissent Fraction, unless a higher Earn-out Amount is earned herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | If the Target recognizes (i) at least $39,000,000 in
Revenue; and (ii) at least $5,900,000 in EBITDA during the Earn-out Period,
then the Earn-out Amount shall be an amount equal to $28,500,000 multiplied
by the Dissent Fraction, unless a higher Earn-out Amount is earned herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | If the Target recognizes (i) at least $40,000,000 in
Revenue; and (ii) at least $6,200,000 in EBITDA during the Earn-out Period,
then the Earn-out Amount shall be an amount equal to $32,000,000 multiplied
by the Dissent Fraction, unless a higher Earn-out Amount is earned herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | If the Target recognizes (i) at least $41,000,000 in
Revenue; and (ii) at least $6,600,000 in EBITDA during the Earn-out Period,
then the Earn-out Amount shall be an amount equal to $35,600,000 multiplied
by the Dissent Fraction, unless a higher Earn-out Amount is earned herein. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 33 -  Revenue; and (ii) at least $6,900,000 in EBITDA during the Earn-out Period,
then the Earn-out Amount shall be an amount equal to $39,200,000 multiplied
by the Dissent Fraction, unless a higher Earn-out Amount is earned herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | If the Target recognizes (i) at least $43,000,000 in
Revenue; and (ii) at least $7,300,000 in EBITDA during the Earn-out Period,
then the Earn-out Amount shall be an amount equal to $42,800,000 multiplied
by the Dissent Fraction, unless a higher Earn-out Amount is earned herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | If the Target recognizes (i) at least $44,000,000 in
Revenue; and (ii) at least $7,700,000 in EBITDA during the Earn-out Period,
then the Earn-out Amount shall be an amount equal to $46,300,000 multiplied
by the Dissent Fraction, unless a higher Earn-out Amount is earned herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (j) | If the Target recognizes (i) at least $45,000,000 in
Revenue; and (ii) at least $8,000,000 in EBITDA during the Earn-out Period,
then the Earn-out Amount shall be an amount equal to $50,000,000 multiplied
by the Dissent Fraction (which is the maximum Earn-out Amount payable
hereunder). 
---|---|--- 

For items (c) - (j) above, if both Revenue and EBITDA during the Earn-out
Period are between two sequential Revenue Targets and EBITDA Targets (e.g.,
$40,250,000 in Revenue and $6,400,000 in EBITDA are between the Revenue
Targets and EBITDA Targets in (e) and (f) above), then the Earn-out Amount
shall be a prorated amount based on 50% contribution for each Earn-out Target
(i.e., in the example above, 25% of the next Revenue Target is achieved,
while 50% of the next EBITDA Target is achieved, resulting in 37.5% of the
incremental Earn-out Amount being earned, or $1,350,000, bringing the total
Earn-out Amount under this example to $33,350,000). For items (c) - (j) above,
if one of Revenue or EBITDA during the Earn-out Period is between two
sequential Revenue Targets or EBITDA Targets (e.g., $6,400,000 in EBITDA is
between the EBITDA Targets in (e) and (f) above) and the other is above the
higher of the two sequential Revenue Targets or EBITDA Targets (e.g.,
$41,250,000 in Revenue is above the Revenue Target in (f) above), then the
Earn-out Amount shall be a prorated amount based on 50% contribution for each
Earn-out Target but with the higher Earn-out Target treated as if it were the
Earn-out Target in the higher of the two sequential Revenue Targets or EBITDA
Targets, as applicable (i.e., in the example above, 50% of the next EBITDA
Target is achieved, and 100% of the next Revenue Target is achieved,
resulting in 75% of the incremental Earn-out Amount being earned, or
$2,700,000, bringing the total Earn-out Amount under this example to
$34,700,000). In no circumstance will such prorating apply to increase the
Earn-out Amount based on non-sequential Revenue Targets or EBITDA Targets.
For the avoidance of doubt, no proration will be made for (a) and (b) above
(i.e., until both Revenue and EBITDA exceed the Revenue Target and the EBITDA
Target in (c) above). 

The Parties agree that if, at any time during the Earn-out Period, Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than any of the Target Companies) develops a
product that replaces any product of the Target Companies existing as of the
Effective Time and causes the Target Companies to exit such product line, then
the Parties and the Shareholder Representative shall 

 



\- 34 -   work together promptly and acting reasonably to adjust the above-referenced
EBITDA Targets and Revenue Targets to account for such lost revenue.

 



   2.15 | Timing and Payment of Earn-out Amount 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If an Earn-out Amount has been earned pursuant to Section
2.14, Acquisition Sub shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Earn-out Amount (as
the same may be reduced as set forth in Article 10) within five (5) Business
Days following the earliest to occur of (i) the thirty-first day after receipt
of the Earn-out Report without the Shareholder Representative notifying
Acquisition Sub that the Shareholder Representative objects to the
computation of Revenue or EBITDA set forth in such Earn-out Report, (ii) the
date on which the Shareholder Representative shall have given Acquisition Sub
notice to the effect that the Shareholder Representative has no objection to
the computation of Revenue or EBITDA set forth in the Earn-out Report, (iii)
the date as of which Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder Representative reach
a settlement in accordance with Section 2.12, and (iv) the date as of which
Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder Representative shall have received the
determination of the Arbitrating Accountant in accordance with Section 2.12. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | The Earn-out Amount, if and when due and payable, shall be
paid by Acquisition Sub to the Depositary (on behalf of the Shareholders) in
cash (in immediately available funds) or shares of Common Stock (which shall
not be subject to any contractual lock-up restrictions) or any combination
thereof, at the election of Acquisition Sub; _provided_ , that payment may be
made in shares of Common Stock only if the Common Stock is then listed on a
national securities exchange in the United States and if Parent has filed all
required reports under section 13 of the Exchange Act, during the 12 months
preceding such sale (or for such shorter period that the Company was required
to file such reports), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K. Any shares of
Common Stock will be valued at the Average Price. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The Depositary shall distribute to each Shareholder who
received a portion of the Aggregate Initial Consideration, in respect of the
Target Shares held by him, her or it immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Target Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly
exercised in accordance with the Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement),
the same proportionate amount of the Cash Earn-out Amount and the Share Earn-
out Amount, if any, as such Shareholder received of the Aggregate Initial
Consideration, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Plan of
Arrangement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

If, at the time the Earn-out Amount is otherwise due and payable hereunder,
there are any unresolved Claims, then Acquisition Sub shall only pay
the portion (if any) of the Earn-out Amount equal to the Earn-out Amount
minus the aggregate amount of all such unresolved Claims (based on, with
respect to any such Claims the amount of which is not readily determinable,
Acquisition Subs good faith estimate). Acquisition Sub will pay any amount
so deducted (less the amount of 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 35 -   any Damages in respect of such Claims determined in accordance with Article
10) once such unresolved Claims have been finally resolved. If the Shareholder
Representative delivers to Acquisition Sub, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of any such good faith estimate, a notice of dispute, then Acquisition
Sub and the Shareholder Representative will use reasonable efforts to reach
agreement within thirty (30) days after such notification, and, if they are
unable to do so, shall promptly submit the dispute to a reputable professional
firm with experience in estimating claims similar to the applicable Claim and
mutually agreed by the parties, whose determination shall be based upon
submissions of Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder Representative (including
any additional information requested by the firm) and shall be (i) in writing,
(ii) furnished to the Shareholder Representative and Acquisition Sub as soon
as practicable (and in no event later than thirty (30) days after submission
of the dispute), and (iii) nonappealable and incontestable by the Shareholder
Representative, the Shareholders, Acquisition Sub and each of their
respective Affiliates and successors and assigns and not subject to
collateral attack for any reason other than manifest error or fraud. 

---|--- 



   2.16 | Withholding Rights 
---|--- 
 

Target, Acquisition Sub, Parent, the Depositary and any of their respective
successors shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
to any Person pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, or on
the payment to Dissenting Shareholders of the fair value of their Target
Shares, such amounts as Target, Acquisition Sub, Parent, the Depositary or any
of their respective successors are required or permitted to deduct or
withhold with respect to such consideration under the Tax Act or any other
Applicable Law or under the administrative practice of the Governmental
Authority administering such law, and any amounts so deducted or withheld
shall be deemed to have been paid to such Person. In any case where property
other than cash is subject to withholding, such property may be disposed of by
the Person liable to make the withholding in order to fund such liability.



   2.17 | Preparation of Filings; Shareholder Communications and Public
Announcements 
---|--- 
 

The Parties shall co-operate in the preparation of any application for any
Regulatory Approvals or other orders, registrations, consents, filings,
rulings, exemptions and approvals, including as contemplated by the following
paragraph, and the preparation of any documents reasonably deemed by any of
the Parties to be necessary to obtain all Contractual Consents and to
discharge their respective obligations under Applicable Law in connection
with this Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement. The Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (which, in the case of Parent and Acquisition
Sub, shall not require such Party to divest of any Assets or to make any
payments or incur any obligations), and shall cooperate with each other, to
obtain promptly such Regulatory Approvals and Contractual Consents; _provided_
, _however_ , that Target shall be responsible for making any payments
required to obtain any such Regulatory Approvals or Contractual Consents (such
as filing fees or consent fees set forth in an applicable Contract);
_provided_ , _further_ , that (i) no Party shall agree (and Target agrees to
cause each Target Subsidiary not to agree) to the payment of any amounts to
obtain a Contractual Consent (other than a consent fee set forth in the
applicable Contract) without the consent of the other Parties, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, and (ii) Target
shall not

 



\- 36 -   agree (and Target agrees to cause each Target Subsidiary not to agree) to
any modification to the terms of any Contract for purposes of obtaining a
Contractual Consent without the prior consent of Parent, which may be given
or withheld in its sole discretion.

From the date hereof to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement, Target shall, and shall cause the Target Subsidiaries to,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
representatives to, provide to Parent cooperation requested by Parent
in connection with any sale of Parents securities (whether primary or
secondary) and as otherwise required under the applicable securities laws
including with respect to the satisfaction by Parent of its reporting and
disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. securities laws, including with
respect to the filing or amendment of any registration statement pursuant to
the Securities Act, including:



     | (i) | participating in meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, and drafting sessions; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | assisting with the preparation of materials for offering
documents, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with
Parents compliance with applicable U.S. securities law; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | furnishing Parent as promptly as practicable with
financial and other pertinent information regarding Target and the Target
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including all
financial statements, pro forma financial information, financial data, audit
reports and other information of the type required by Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of type and form
customarily included in a registration statement on Form S-1 (or any
applicable successor form) under the Securities Act for a public offering
which shall include but not be limited to financial statements of Target on a
consolidated basis for the fiscal years ending on December 31, 2007, December
31, 2008 and December 31, 2009 (and any more recent completed annual period)
and any interim period financial statements of Target that would be required
by the SEC; _provided_ , that Target shall provide audited financial
statements, the audit report thereon and other applicable information with
respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 for Target and the Target
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Date, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide them no later than March 7, 2011; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | obtaining accountants comfort letters and required
consents to the filing of financial statements with the SEC from the
applicable accounting firms including standard negative assurance on any
interim period and pro forma financial statements necessary with respect to
Parents filings with the SEC. 
---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding the above, each Party and the Shareholder Representative
agrees not to (and Target further agrees to cause each Target Subsidiary not
to) (a) issue any press release or otherwise make public announcements with
respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement

 



\- 37 -   without the written consent of the other Parties, unless otherwise required
by Applicable Law (it being understood that Parent will issue a press release,
in form and substance substantially similar to the draft reviewed by Target,
announcing that it has entered into this Agreement and will make related
filings with the SEC) or (b) make any filing with any Governmental Authority
with respect thereto without prior consultation with the other Parties,
unless such consultation is prohibited by Applicable Law.



   2.18 | Articles of Arrangement and Effective Date 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Articles of Arrangement shall implement the Plan of
Arrangement. The Articles of Arrangement shall include the form of the Plan of
Arrangement attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit B_ and any amendments or
variations thereto made in accordance with Section 9.4 and the terms thereof
or made at the direction of the Court in the Final Order with the consent of
Target, Acquisition Sub and Parent, each acting reasonably and in good faith. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | On the fifth Business Day after the Parties have agreed in
writing that all of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their terms,
cannot be satisfied until the Effective Date, but subject to the satisfaction
or, where not prohibited, the waiver by the applicable Party or Parties in
whose favour the condition is, of those conditions as of the Effective Date)
set forth in Article 8 have been satisfied (or, where not prohibited, waived
by the applicable Party or Parties in whose favour the condition is), unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the Parties, the Articles of
Arrangement shall be filed by Target with the Director. Target shall not file
the Articles of Arrangement with the Director until such written agreement has
been obtained. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | From and after the Effective Time, the Plan of Arrangement
shall have all of the effects provided by Applicable Law.

and the Plan of Arrangement will take place at the Toronto, Ontario offices of
Blake, Cassels and Graydon LLP on the Effective Date with effect as of the
Effective Time, or at such other place as the Parties shall mutually agree
upon. 
---|---|--- 



   2.19 | United States Section 3(a)(10) Exemption 
---|--- 

The Arrangement shall be structured such that the issuance of Common Stock
under the Arrangement qualifies in the United States for the exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section
3(a)(10) of the Securities Act (the "Section 3(a)(10) Exemption") and
applicable state securities laws in reliance upon similar exemptions under
applicable state securities laws. Each of the Parties agrees to act in good
faith, consistent with the intent of such Parties and the intended treatment
of the Arrangement as set forth in this

 



\- 38 -   Section 2.19. In order to ensure the availability of the Section 3(a)(10)
Exemption, each of the Parties agrees that the Arrangement will be carried out
on the following basis: 



     | (a) | the Arrangement will be subject to the approval of the Court
in accordance with Section 192 of the CBCA; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the Court will be advised as to the intention of the Parties
to rely on the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption prior to the Court hearing at which
the Final Order will be sought; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the Court will be required to satisfy itself that the terms
and conditions of the Arrangement are fair to the holders of Target Shares
before approving the Arrangement;  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | the Final Order will expressly state that the Arrangement is
approved by the Court as being fair to the Shareholders to whom Common Stock
will be issued;  
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | such Parties will ensure that each Shareholder entitled to
receive Common Stock on completion of the Arrangement will be given adequate
notice advising them of their right to attend the Court hearing and providing
them with sufficient information necessary for them to exercise that right and
such Parties shall comply with the terms of the Interim Order and this
Agreement including Section 2.4(a);  
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | the Circular shall contain a statement advising Shareholders
that the Common Stock issued in the Arrangement have not been registered under
the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance on the Section 3(a)(10)

subject to restrictions on resale under the securities laws of the United
States, including, as applicable, Rule 144 under the Securities Act with
respect to affiliates; 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | the Interim Order approving the Special Meeting to approve
the Arrangement will specify that each Shareholder will have the right to
appear before the Court at the Court hearing on the Final Order so long as
such Shareholder enters an appearance within a reasonable time; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | the Final Order shall include a statement to the following
effect: "This Order will serve as a basis of a claim to an exemption pursuant
to Section 3(a)(10) of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
from the registration requirements otherwise imposed by that Act, regarding
the issuance of Common Stock under the Arrangement." 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 39 -  ---|--- 



     | (a) | At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective
Date, Target will cause to be prepared and delivered to Acquisition Sub: (i)
the statement of estimated Effective Date Net Working Capital (the "Estimated
Effective Date Statement of Net Working Capital"); and (ii) the statement of
estimated Indebtedness of the Target Companies (the "Estimated Effective
Date Statement of Indebtedness") as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time ("Effective Date Indebtedness" and, together with the Estimated Effective
Date Statement of Net Working Capital, the "Estimated Effective Date
Statements"). The Estimated Effective Date Statement of Net Working Capital
will be accompanied by a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Target
specifying that the Estimated Effective Date Statement of Net Working Capital
is Targets good faith estimate of Effective Date Net Working Capital and
Target shall deliver back-up detail and data for the Estimated Effective Date
Statement of Net Working Capital. Such information shall be in form and level
of detail consistent with the supporting documentation of the Financial
Statements presented to Acquisition Sub by Target. The estimated Effective
Date Indebtedness shall be Targets good faith estimate of Effective Date
Indebtedness.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Within 90 days following the Effective Date, Acquisition Sub
shall, or shall cause Target to, prepare and deliver to the Shareholder
Representative: (i) the statement of proposed Effective Date Net Working
Capital (the "Proposed Effective Date Statement of Net Working Capital"), and
(ii) the statement of proposed Effective Date Indebtedness (the "Proposed
Effective Date Statement of Indebtedness" and, together with the Proposed
Effective Date Statement of Net Working Capital, the "Proposed Effective Date
Statements"). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

The Shareholder Representative shall have 45 days following receipt of the
Proposed Effective Date Statements to review such calculations. If
the Shareholder Representative disagrees with Acquisition Subs calculation
of any of the Effective Date Net Working Capital or Effective Date
Indebtedness delivered pursuant to Section 2.20(b), then the Shareholder
Representative may, within the 45-day review period, deliver a notice to
Acquisition Sub disagreeing with any such calculation. The Shareholder
Representative may make inquiries of Parent and its accountants and
appropriate employees regarding questions concerning or disagreements with
the Proposed Effective Date Statements arising in the course of its review
thereof, and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause any such employees
and accountants to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries in a
timely manner (subject to the Shareholder Representative entering into any
confidentiality and other agreements reasonably required by the accountants).
Any such notice of disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail those items
or amounts as to which the Shareholder Representative disagrees and shall
specify the Shareholder Representatives proposed adjustment(s) to the
applicable Proposed Effective Date Statement, 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 40 -   and the Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all
other items and amounts contained in the Proposed Effective Date Statement of
Net Working Capital and the Proposed Effective Date Statement of
Indebtedness. If the Shareholder Representative fails to give Acquisition Sub
such notice of disagreement within such 45-day period, then the Shareholder
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with Acquisition Sub as to the
Proposed Effective Date Statements. 

---|--- 



     | (d) | If any notice of disagreement shall be duly and timely
delivered pursuant to Section 2.20(c), then Acquisition Sub and the
Shareholder Representative shall, during the 30 days following such delivery,
use their respective reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts set forth on the applicable Proposed Effective Date
Statement(s). If, during such 30-day period, Acquisition Sub and the
Shareholder Representative are unable to reach agreement with respect to any
such disagreement(s), they shall within five (5) Business Days of the end of
such period select an Accounting Referee to promptly commence a review of
this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating Effective Date Net Working Capital and/or Effective Date
Indebtedness, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.20. In making any such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider
only those items or amounts in the Proposed Effective Date Statement of Net
Working Capital and/or the Proposed Effective Date Statement of Indebtedness,
as applicable, as to which Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder Representative
have disagreed, as follows: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | to the extent there are any disputed items or amounts of
Effective Date Net Working Capital, the Accounting Referees determination of
Effective Date Net Working Capital shall not be less than the amount thereof
shown in Acquisition Subs calculations delivered pursuant to Section 2.20(b)
or more than the amount thereof shown in the Shareholder Representative
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.20(c); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | to the extent there are any disputed items or amounts of
Effective Date Indebtedness, the Accounting Referees determination shall not
be more than the amount thereof shown in Acquisition Subs calculations
delivered pursuant to Section 2.20(b) or less than the amount thereof shown in
the Shareholder Representative calculation delivered pursuant to Section
2.20(c). 
---|---|--- 
 

Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder Representative shall instruct the
Accounting Referee to deliver to Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder
Representative, as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 30 days
after the Accounting Referee has commenced any such review, a report setting
forth such calculation. Any such report shall be final and binding upon the
Parties, the Shareholder Representative and the Shareholders. The Effective
Date Net Working Capital set forth in the Proposed Effective Date Statement of
Net Working Capital and the Effective Date Indebtedness set forth in the
Proposed Effective Date Statement of Indebtedness, in each case, either as
agreed to by Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder

 



\- 41 -   Representative, if such statement is not referred to the Accounting Referee,
or as finally determined by the Accounting Referee, shall be the "Final
Effective Date Net Working Capital" and the "Final Effective Date
Indebtedness", respectively.



     | (e) | The cost of any such Accounting Referee review and report
shall be borne by the party whose position with respect to the calculation in
Section 2.20(b) or Section 2.20(c), as applicable, bears the greatest
difference to the final position of the Accounting Referee. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder Representative agree
that they will cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Estimated
Effective Date Statements and the Proposed Effective Date Statements, the
calculation of Effective Date Net Working Capital and Effective Date
Indebtedness, and in the conduct of the reviews and determinations identified
by Section 2.20(d), including making available, to the extent necessary, such
books, records, work papers and personnel as are in such partys control. 
---|---|--- 



   2.21 | Adjustment to Consideration 
---|--- 



     | (a) | At the Effective Date, the $100,000,000 amount set forth in
the definition of Aggregate Initial Consideration shall be: (1) (x) reduced by
the amount, if any, by which the Base Net Working Capital exceeds the
Effective Date Net Working Capital set forth in the Estimated Effective Date
Statements or (y) increased by the amount, if any, by which Effective Date Net
Working Capital set forth in the Estimated Effective Date Statements exceeds
the Base Net Working Capital; and (2) reduced by the amount of Effective Date
Indebtedness set forth in the Estimated Effective Date Statements. "Base Net
Working Capital" means $0. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section
2.21(a) shall be made at the Effective Date and shall reduce or increase, as
applicable, the Aggregate Initial Consideration. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Upon the determination of the Final Effective Date Net
Working Capital and the Final Effective Date Indebtedness pursuant to Section
2.20(d), the consideration payable under this Agreement shall be: (1) (x)
reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Effective Date Net Working Capital
set forth in the Estimated Effective Date Statements exceeds the Final
Effective Date Net Working Capital or (y) increased by the amount, if any, by
which the Final Effective Date Net Working Capital exceeds the Effective Date
Net Working Capital set forth in the Estimated Effective Date Statements; and
(2) (x) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Effective Date
Indebtedness exceeds the Effective Date Indebtedness set forth in the
Estimated Effective Date Statements or (y) increased by the amount, if any, by
which the Effective Date Indebtedness set forth in the Estimated Effective
Date Statements exceeds the Final Effective Date Indebtedness. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

If there is a net increase in the consideration payable under this Agreement
pursuant to Section 2.21(b), then Acquisition Sub shall promptly, but no
later 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 42 -   than five (5) Business Days after such calculation has been determined, pay
to the Depositary by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount
equal to the product of (x) the amount of such net increase and (y) the
Dissent Fraction (the "Additional Aggregate Initial Consideration"), and the
Depositary shall distribute such proceeds to the Shareholders in accordance
with the Plan of Arrangement. Upon receipt by the Depositary of the
Additional Aggregate Initial Consideration, the obligation of Acquisition Sub
to pay the Additional Aggregate Initial Consideration to the Shareholders
shall be satisfied in full and the Shareholders shall look only to the
Depositary for their payment of the Additional Aggregate Initial
Consideration. If there is a net reduction in the consideration payable under
this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.21(b), then Acquisition Sub shall
promptly, but no later than five (5) days after such calculation has been
determined, receive from the Indemnity Escrow Account an amount equal to such
net reduction, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
of Acquisition Sub (and the Shareholder Representative and Acquisition Sub
shall issue joint written instructions no more than one (1) Business Day after
such calculation has been determined directing the Escrow Agent to make such
payment). If, at the time the Additional Aggregate Initial Consideration is
otherwise due and payable hereunder and pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement,
there are any unresolved Claims, then Acquisition Sub shall only pay the
portion (if any) of the Additional Aggregate Initial Consideration equal to
the Additional Aggregate Initial Consideration minus the aggregate amount of
all such unresolved Claims (based on, with respect to any such Claims the
amount of which is not readily determinable, Acquisition Subs good faith
estimate). Acquisition Sub will pay any amount so deducted (less the amount of
any Damages in respect of such Claims determined in accordance with Article
10) once such unresolved Claims have been finally resolved. If the
Shareholder Representative delivers to Acquisition Sub, within thirty (30)
days after receipt of any such good faith estimate, a notice of dispute, then
Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder Representative will use reasonable efforts
to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after such notification, and, if
they are unable to do so, shall promptly submit the dispute to a reputable
professional firm with experience in estimating claims similar to the
applicable Claim and mutually agreed by the parties, whose determination
shall be based upon submissions of Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder
Representative (including any additional information requested by the firm)
and shall be (i) in writing, (ii) furnished to the Shareholder Representative
and Acquisition Sub as soon as practicable (and in no event later than thirty
(30) days after submission of the dispute), and (iii) nonappealable and
incontestable by the Shareholder Representative, the Shareholders,
Acquisition Sub and each of their respective Affiliates and successors and
assigns and not subject to collateral attack for any reason other than
manifest error or fraud. 

---|--- 
 



\- 43 -  ---|--- 
 

It is understood that the establishment of $0 as the amount of Base Net
Working Capital was a negotiated result to establish the base from which any
adjustment to the Aggregate Initial Consideration is to be calculated, and,
therefore, will not influence or affect in any respect the calculation of
Effective Date Net Working Capital.

by Applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Until such time as the Earn-out Amount, if any, has been

     | (d) | After the Effective Date, Target shall in good faith control

---|---|--- 



     | (e) | During the Interim Period, Target shall, and shall cause
each other Target Company to, take the actions set forth on Schedule 5.3(e). 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 81 -  Prior to the Effective Date, Target may seek a favourable determination from
the competent authority of Canada under the Treaty that Silverback Media Plc
is, and always has been, solely a resident of the United Kingdom for purposes
of the Treaty. If such favourable determination is obtained in writing, in a
form acceptable to Acquisition Sub acting reasonably, prior to the Effective
Date, then the Escrow Tax Amount shall be reduced to $0. If such favourable
determination is obtained in writing, in a form acceptable to Acquisition Sub
acting reasonably, following the Effective Date and on or prior to May 30,
2011, then Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder Representative shall issue
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release to the Depositary (for the benefit of the Shareholders) from the Tax
Escrow Account all amounts remaining therein. Prior to May 30, 2011, Target
(prior to the Effective Date) and the Shareholder Representative (following
the Effective Date) may request from Acquisition Sub that Target pursue other
courses of action intended to reduce and/or eliminate any potential Taxes
attributable to the matter set forth in this Section 5.3(f). Acquisition Sub
shall consider in good faith any such request. If, after such consideration,
Acquisition Sub acting reasonably consents to any such course of action, then
Target may pursue the same (provided that any cost of pursuing such action
shall be paid from the Tax Escrow Account and provided that each specific
action shall require the consent of Acquisition Sub, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If a favourable determination
has not been obtained by the date which is five (5) Business Days prior to the
date such Tax is due and payable, then Acquisition Sub shall be entitled at
any time after such date to issue sole written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to or at the direction of
Acquisition Sub, from the Tax Escrow Account, the aggregate amount of all
Taxes which Acquisition Sub determines in good faith are liable to be paid by
the Target Companies as a result of Silverback Media Plc not being solely a
resident of the United Kingdom for purposes of the Treaty at all times, plus
the amount of all Damages, if any, incurred by any Parent Indemnitees in
connection therewith (including interest, penalties, costs of defense, costs
of preparing amended returns and costs of legal and tax advisors). If any
relevant taxing authority subsequently determines that any additional Tax is
owing by any Target Company in respect of this matter, then Acquisition Sub
shall be entitled to issue sole written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release to or at the direction of Acquisition
Sub, from the Tax Escrow Account, the aggregate amount of all such additional
Taxes, plus the amount of all Damages, if any, incurred by any Parent
Indemnitees in connection therewith (including interest, penalties, costs of
defense, costs of preparing amended returns and costs of legal and tax
advisors). Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Effective Date,
Acquisition Sub will cause the Target Companies to cooperate with the
Shareholder Representative (at the sole cost and expense of the Shareholder
Representative) in connection with the pursuit of any appeals with respect 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 82 -   to the Taxes paid out of the Tax Escrow Account, including providing
reasonable access to and copies of relevant documentation reasonably required
by the Shareholder Representative in the pursuit of such appeals and
participation in such proceedings; _provided_ , that no appeal shall be
pursued, and no position shall be taken, that, in the good faith determination
of Acquisition Sub, may subject any Parent Indemnitees to any
further potential Damages or would be inconsistent with Applicable Law. Any
refunds obtained in connection with such proceedings shall first be paid to
the Parent Indemnitees for any Taxes attributable to the matter set forth in
this Section 5.3(f) or Damages related thereto that were not previously paid
to the Parent Indemnitees from the Tax Escrow Account and, thereafter, any
amount remaining shall be deposited in the Tax Escrow Account. At such time as
Acquisition Sub determines in good faith that no further Taxes will be due or
owing (and no related Damages remain unpaid), Acquisition Sub shall notify the
Shareholder Representative, and Acquisition Sub and the Shareholder
Representative shall then promptly issue joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to the Depositary (for
the benefit of the Shareholders) from the Tax Escrow Account all amounts
remaining therein at such time. 

---|--- 
 



     | (g) | As soon as practicable (and, in any event, no later than
February 7, 2011), Target shall provide to Parent a schedule setting forth,
for purposes of the Tax Act and any comparable Applicable Law of any province
or territory of Canada, the nature and amounts of each Target Companys
depreciable property of the prescribed classes and undepreciated capital
costs, non-capital losses in the amounts and for the taxation years set forth
thereon, net capital losses in the amounts and for the taxation years set
forth thereon, investment tax credits set forth thereon and the balance of
deductible scientific research and experimental development expenditures
applicable to future years set forth thereon. 
---|---|--- 



   5.4 | Co-operation and Integration Planning 
---|--- 

Subject to compliance with Applicable Laws, during the Interim Period, Target
shall and shall cause each other Target Company to cooperate with and assist
Acquisition Sub and Parent in planning and preparing for the integration of
the business of Target Companies with the business carried on by Parent and
its Subsidiaries.



   5.5 | Employees 
---|--- 

The Target Companies may in the ordinary course during the Interim Period
(after consultation with Acquisition Sub and subject to Applicable Law,
including laws relating to the confidentiality of employment information)
terminate any Employee whose annual salary or wage is less than one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000) and hire (after consultation with Acquisition Sub)
an individual to replace any such terminated Employee or to replace any
Employee whose annual salary or wage is less than one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000) and whose employment terminates for any reason during the
Interim Period, so long as the terms of

 



\- 83 -   employment of such individual are not materially different from those of the
Employee replaced. Target Companies shall not hire any other individual
without giving prior written notice to Acquisition Sub and affording
Acquisition Sub the opportunity to consult with the Target Companies regarding
such individual. The Target Companies shall consider in good faith the views
of Acquisition Sub with respect to any such hiring decisions. The Target
Companies shall not adopt or amend any Employee Plan without the prior written
consent of Acquisition Sub. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Target Companies shall not without the written consent of Acquisition
Sub, during the Interim Period: (a) make any general or specific increase in
the remuneration of the Employees, officers, directors, and service agents of
the Target Companies, nor grant to them any additional benefits except for
normal salary increases at normal review dates in accordance with the normal
policy of the Business; (b) take any action with respect to the grant of any
severance, change of control, bonus, discretionary bonus, incentive payments
or termination pay to, or enter into any employment agreement, deferred
compensation or other similar agreement (or amend such existing agreement)
with any officer, employee or director of any Target Company; (c) increase any
benefits payable under any existing severance or termination pay policies or
employment agreements, or adopt or amend or make any contribution to any
Employee Plan or other bonus, profit sharing, option, pension, retirement,
deferred compensation, insurance, incentive compensation, compensation or
other similar plan, agreement, trust, fund or arrangement for the benefit of
directors, officers or employees or former directors, officers or employees of
any Target Company; or (d) increase compensation, bonus levels or
other benefits payable to any director, executive officer or employee of any
Target Company.

During the Interim Period, Target shall not, and shall not permit the other
Target Companies to, authorize or propose, or enter into or modify any
Collective Agreement without the written authorization of Acquisition Sub.

 

On the Effective Date, Target shall and shall cause the other Target Companies
to deliver a purchase or clearance certificate issued by the workers
compensation or workplace safety and insurance board or similar authorities in
each of the provinces in which the Target Companies have Employees which will
certify to Acquisition Sub that there are no assessments which are unpaid at
the Effective Date.

as otherwise required by Applicable Law, during the Interim Period:

contemplated in this Agreement, during the Interim Period:

 



     | (a) | it shall not take any action, refrain from taking any action

expected to impede the consummation of the Arrangement and other transactions
contemplated hereunder;

     | (ii) | cooperate with Target to oppose, lift or rescind any
injunction or restraining Order or other Order or action seeking to enjoin the
Arrangement, or otherwise adversely affecting the ability of Acquisition Sub
and Target to complete the transactions contemplated hereunder; 
---|---|--- 
 

provided that nothing in this Section 6.1(b) shall derogate from Acquisition
Subs rights under Article 9; and

 



     | (c) | it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its
affairs so all of its representations and warranties contained herein shall be

continue to be true and correct as of such specified date). 
---|---|--- 



   6.2 | Directors Indemnification 
---|--- 

Acquisition Sub will ensure that the by-laws of Target, and the constating

out Targets. After the Effective Date until the end of the Earn-out Period,
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall:



     | (a) | maintain separate accounting for the Target Companies for
purposes of determining whether the Earn-out Targets have been achieved; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | not dispose of, wind-down or discontinue any portion of the
business of the Target Companies for the purpose of hindering or impairing the
ability of the business to achieve the Earn-out Targets; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | not require any Target Company to enter into any material
non-ordinary course transactions that would hinder or impair the ability of
the business to achieve the Earn-out Targets; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | permit Target management to operate Target in a manner
substantially consistent with the operating parameters, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a reasonable level of staffing
and capital assets which it reasonably believes are appropriate to operate
within such parameters (in each case, for so long as Parent has not determined
in good faith that doing so would be materially adverse to the Target
Companies or Parent); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | not require any member of Targets management team (as in
place at the Effective Date) to spend more than 20% of their business time and
attention to businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries, other than the
business of the Target Companies to be included in the calculations of EBITDA
and Revenue, without the consent of the Shareholder Representative. 
---|---|--- 
 



   6.4 | Acknowledgment 
---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Acquisition Sub may from time to
time make such business decisions as they deem appropriate in the conduct of
Targets business, including actions that may have an impact on Revenue and
EBITDA and achievement of all or any portion of any Earn-out Amount and
including an amalgamation of Acquisition Sub and Target. No Shareholder or
former Shareholder shall have any right to claim any lost Earn-out Amount or
other damages as a result of such decisions so long as the actions were not
taken by Parent and Acquisition Sub in bad faith for the purpose of
frustrating the achievement of the Earn-out Amount, except to the extent that
any such decision shall constitute a material violation of Section 6.3.

 



\- 89 -  ---|--- 

If Parent or Acquisition Sub breaches its covenants set forth in Section 6.3,
then the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders) may seek
specific performance in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section
11.7 and may sue for damages.



   6.6 | Extraordinary Transaction 
---|--- 
 

If, after the Effective Time and prior to the end of the Earn-out Period,
Parent engages in any (a) merger, consolidation or reorganization (in which
Parent is not the surviving entity), or (b) sale, transfer or other
distribution of all or substantially all of the capital stock or assets of the
Target Companies, then, as a condition to the closing of any
such transaction, Parent shall have obtained the acquirors written agreement
to assume and continue the rights and obligations of Parent and Acquisition
Sub under the Earn-out Provisions and Sections 6.3 through 6.6.

 



   6.7 | Parent Guaranty

Parent hereby guarantees the performance when due by Acquisition Sub of its
obligations set forth in this Agreement.

purposes of the Treaty plus the amount of all Damages incurred by any Parent
Indemnitees in connection therewith (including interest, penalties, costs of
defense, costs of preparing amended returns and costs of legal and tax
advisors); _provided_ that the Parent Indemnitees sole recourse for any such
Damages (except for claims of fraud) shall be to reduce the Earn-out Amount
due (if any) by the amount of Damages so incurred or suffered (other than with
respect to (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, which shall first be paid from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, or (v) above, which shall first be paid from the
Tax Escrow Account, in each case, before reducing the Earn-out Amount); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to indemnification pursuant to (i)
above, other than any Special Representations, no reduction of the Earn-out
Amount shall be made unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages
thereunder exceeds $200,000 (the "Basket Amount") but the full amount of all
such Damages (including such Basket Amount) shall be included once such
Damages exceed the Basket Amount. Except (1) for claims of fraud and (2) with
respect to (ii), (iii) and (iv) above (which shall also include the Indemnity

warranties, all qualifications of materiality or Material Adverse Effect
shall be disregarded.

     | (c) | The representations, warranties and covenants in this
Agreement and in any certificate delivered in connection herewith (in each
case, as the same may be qualified by the disclosure schedules attached to
this Agreement) shall in no event be affected by any investigation, inquiry or
examination made for or on behalf of Parent, Acquisition Sub or their
Affiliates, or the knowledge of their respective officers, directors,
shareholders, employees or agents, or the acceptance by them of any
certificate under this Agreement, and their rights to indemnification under

"Indemnified Party") shall give prompt notice to the Shareholder
Representative (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion or commencement of
any Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought and will provide the
Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not diminish the right to set-off against the Earn-out Amount hereunder,
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of
the Claim is adversely prejudiced by the Indemnifying Partys failure to give
that notice. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If an Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying
Party of any Claim asserted by any third party ("Third-Party Claim"), then the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of the
Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made
and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation
would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide
reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to
defend the Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to the
Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from
the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume
the defense of the Third-Party Claim (and subject to the conditions set forth
in the preceding sentence), the Indemnifying Party shall not, so long as it
diligently conducts the defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this
Article 10 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect
to the defense of the Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim,
other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, then (A) such assumption will
conclusively establish for purposes of this Article 10 that the claims made in
that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to
indemnification, and (B) no compromise or settlement of the Third-Party Claim
may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys
written consent unless (1) there is no finding or admission of any violation
of Applicable Law or any violation of the rights of any Person; (2) the sole
relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party (unless, in connection with such settlement, the Indemnified Party
will be entitled to reduce the Earn-out Amount by the full amount of the
Damages, in which case such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and (3) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability
with respect to any compromise or settlement of the Third-Party Claims
effected without its written consent. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim
may adversely 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 99 -   affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for
which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Article 10, then the
Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the
exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle the Third-Party Claim, but the
Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of any Third-Party
Claim so defended for the purposes of this Article 10 or any compromise or
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). 

---|--- 



     | (d) | With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to
indemnification under this Article 10: (i) both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person
reasonably informed of the status of the Third-Party Claim and any related
proceedings at all stages thereof where the Person is not represented by its
own counsel, and (ii) the Parties agree to render to each other assistance as
they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with
each other to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to
indemnification under this Article 10, the parties agree to cooperate in a
manner as to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of
all confidential information and the attorney-client and work-product
privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use
reasonable efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has
assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of confidential
information (consistent with applicable law and rules of procedure), and (ii)
all communications between any party hereto and counsel responsible for
or participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent
possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-
product privilege. 
---|---|--- 
 



   10.4 | Limitation on Damages 
---|--- 
 

The amount of any Damages which reduce the Earn-out Amount shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable
insurance policies (net of any collection costs and any increase in insurance
premiums resulting therefrom, which such increase shall be evidenced by
reasonable documentation related thereto).

   11.5 | Severability 
---|--- 

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated and the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement to preserve each Partys anticipated benefits
under this Agreement.

 



   11.6 | Entire Agreement, Assignment; Governing Law; Jurisdiction 
---|--- 

This Agreement (including all Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and the Plan of
Arrangement, together with all other documents and instruments referred to
herein and therein, constitute the entire agreement and supersede all other
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

After the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub may assign all or any part of its
rights under this Agreement to, and its obligations under this Agreement may
be assumed by, an Affiliate of Acquisition Sub and Parent may assign all or
any part of its rights under this Agreement to, and its obligations under this
Agreement may be assumed by, any successor to Parent (whether by

 



\- 103 -   operation of law or otherwise), provided that if such assignment and/or
assumption takes place, the assignor shall continue to be liable jointly and
severally with such assignee for all of its obligations hereunder. Except as
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interest or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any
Party hereto or the Shareholder Representative, in whole or in part (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other Parties.

The law of the State of New York shall govern all questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the Schedules attached hereto, and the performance of the obligations
imposed by this Agreement, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York;  _provided_ , that the
provisions of this Agreement which Ontario law requires be governed thereby
shall be governed in all respects, including validity, interpretation and
effect, by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of
Canada applicable therein, without giving effect to the principles of
conflict of laws thereof.

Each Party hereto and the Shareholder Representative irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court located in
Manhattan, New York, New York, United States, or if such court does not have
jurisdiction, the courts of the State of New York located in Manhattan, New
York, New York, United States, for the purposes of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby. Each of the Parties hereto and the Shareholder Representative further
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document to such
Partys (or the Shareholder Representatives, as applicable) respective
address set forth in Section 11.4 shall be effective service of process for
any action, suit or proceeding in the State of New York with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of the Parties hereto and the
Shareholder Representative irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding set forth
above arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The
Parties hereto and the Shareholder Representative hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waive trial by jury in any legal action or proceeding relating
to this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection therewith
and for any counterclaim with respect thereto.

 



   11.7 | Specific Performance and Other Relief 
---|--- 

Each of the Parties hereto and the Shareholder Representative recognizes and
acknowledges that a breach by any Party (or by the Shareholder Representative)
of any material obligations contained in this Agreement will cause another
Party to sustain irreparable injury for which it would not have an adequate
remedy at law for money damages. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of any material obligations contained in this Agreement,
any aggrieved Party shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance of
such obligations and interlocutory, preliminary and permanent injunctive and
other equitable relief (without posting a bond). Nothing in this Section
11.7 shall prevent a Party from seeking any other remedy to which it may be
entitled, at law or in equity; _provided_ , that no Party or the

 



\- 104 -   Shareholder Representative shall be liable to another Party or the
Shareholder Representative in respect of this Agreement for any lost profits
or consequential, punitive, special or indirect damages.



   11.8 | Publicity 
---|--- 

From and after the date hereof, including after termination of this
Agreement, but terminating upon the Effective Date, no public release or
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued
by any Party or the Shareholder Representative without the prior written
consent of each of Parent and Target (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except that Parent may make any such release or
announcement as may be required by Applicable Law or the rules or regulations
of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case the Party
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other Parties
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance.



   11.9 | Counterparts 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall be
deemed to constitute one and the same instrument, and it shall not be
necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce more than one
counterpart.



   11.10 | Waiver 
---|--- 

No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the Party so
waiving. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of
any Party, or a failure or delay by any Party in exercising any power, right
or privilege under this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by
the Party taking such action of compliance with any representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements contained herein, and in any documents
delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement. The waiver by any
Party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate
or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

ARTICLE 12

 

SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE



   12.1 | Appointment and Expenses 
---|--- 
 

The Shareholder Representative will be appointed as the sole representative of
the Shareholders to act as the agent and on behalf of the Shareholders
following the Effective Time regarding any matter relating to or under this
Agreement, the Depositary Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including for
the purposes of: (i) making decisions with respect to the price
adjustments under Sections 2.20 and 2.21; (ii) taking any and all actions
that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Shareholder
Representative, in its sole discretion, in connection with the amendment or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement, the Depositary Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement; and (iii) taking any and all actions that may be necessary
or desirable, as

 



\- 105 -   determined by the Shareholder Representative, in its sole discretion, in
connection with negotiating or entering into settlements and compromises of
any claim for indemnification pursuant to Article 10 or any dispute regarding
the price adjustments under Sections 2.20 and 2.21. As the representative of
the Shareholders under this Agreement, the Depositary Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, the Shareholder Representative shall act as the agent for all
Shareholders, shall have authority to bind each such Person, and Parent and
Acquisition Sub may rely on such appointment and authority until the receipt
of notice of the appointment of a successor upon two (2) Business Days prior
written notice to Parent and Acquisition Sub. Parent and Acquisition Sub may
conclusively rely upon, without independent verification or investigation, all
decisions made by the Shareholder Representative in connection with
this Agreement, the Depositary Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
Shareholder Representative will be entitled to withdraw from the
Representative Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement amounts
necessary to pay or reimburse for any Representative Expenses. Upon the
expiration of the Escrow Agreement in accordance with its terms, the funds
remaining in the Representative Escrow Account that shall not have been used
to pay Representative Expenses (if any) shall be paid to the Depositary for
payment to the Shareholders in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement. If the
amounts in the Representative Escrow Account are insufficient to pay or
reimburse the Shareholder Representative for the Representative Expenses, then
the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to receive an amount equal
to the unpaid Representative Expenses out of amounts otherwise payable to the
Shareholders under this Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement, and, prior to
the release of funds to the Shareholders (or the Depositary on their behalf)
from the Escrow Accounts, an amount equal to any shortfall in the
Representatives Escrow Account will be deducted and paid over to the
Shareholder Representative.

 



   12.2 | Liability 
---|--- 

Except for fraud on its part, the Shareholder Representative shall have no
liability to any other Shareholder or to Parent, Acquisition Sub or any
Affiliates of Parent or Acquisition Sub for any action or omission by the
Shareholder Representative on behalf of the other Shareholders.



   12.3 | Replacement 
---|--- 

The Shareholder Representative shall not resign its position without the
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that the Shareholder Representative may
resign without the consent of Parent if at such time there are no amounts
left in the Representative Escrow Account, the Shareholder Representative has
given Parent at least ten (10) Business Days notice and additional funds have
not been added to the Representative Escrow Account prior to the end of such
ten (10) Business Days. Acquisition Sub, in its sole discretion, may elect to
move funds from any Escrow Account to the Representative Escrow Account at any
time upon the request of the Shareholder Representative, or may cause to be
placed in the Representative Escrow Account additional funds. If Acquisition
Sub causes to be placed in the Representative Escrow Account additional funds
(other than from an Escrow Account), then Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be
entitled to reduce, by the aggregate amount of such funds, any amounts payable
to the Depositary or the Shareholders under this Agreement or the Plan of
Arrangement. If the Shareholder Representative resigns, dies or becomes
disabled and is unable to perform its duties under this Agreement, then the

 



\- 106 -   Shareholders holding a majority of the Target Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Target Shares in respect of which Dissent
Rights have been validly exercised in accordance with the Interim Order and
the Plan of Arrangement) shall promptly appoint a replacement Shareholder
Representative, and will promptly notify Parent of such replacement, including
a duly executed acceptance from such replacement.

as Target, Acquisition Sub, Parent, the Depositary or any of their
respective successors are required or permitted to deduct or withhold with
respect to such consideration under the Tax Act or any other Applicable Law or
under the administrative practice of the Governmental Authority administering

Lock-Up Agreement

 

 _ _, 2011 

Motricity, Inc.

601 108th Avenue Northeast

Suite 800

 

Bellevue, WA 98004



     | Re: | _Motricity, Inc. - Lock-Up Agreement_ 
---|---|--- 
 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned expects to receive approximately [ ] shares (the
"Shares") of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of
Motricity, Inc. (the "Company") pursuant to an Arrangement Agreement dated as
of January [ ], 2011, by and among Adenyo, Inc., the Company and the other
parties thereto (the "Arrangement Agreement"), in connection with the closing
of the transactions on the Effective Date (as defined in the Arrangement
Agreement). Any shares of Common Stock which may be acquired by the
undersigned in connection with the Earn-out Amount (as defined in the
Arrangement Agreement) are not subject to this Lock-Up Agreement.

In consideration of good and valuable consideration the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned agrees that,
during the period specified in the following paragraph (the "Lock-Up Period"),
the undersigned will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any
option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of any of the
Shares, except that one-third of the Shares shall not be subject to this Lock-
Up Agreement. The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude the
undersigned from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is
designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a
sale or disposition of the Shares even if such Shares would be disposed of by
someone other than the undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or other
transactions would include without limitation any short sale or any purchase,
sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put or call
option) with respect to any of the Shares or with respect to any security that
includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from such
Shares.

The Lock-Up Period will commence on the date of this Lock-Up Agreement and
continue for 45 days after the Effective Date with respect to one-third of the
Shares and for 90 days after the Effective Date with respect to one-third of
the Shares.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the undersigned may transfer the Shares (i) as
a bona fide gift or gifts or pursuant to a will or under the laws of
intestacy, (ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the
undersigned or the immediate family of the undersigned, _provided_ that any
such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value, or (iii) with the
prior written consent of the Company; _provided_ that in the case of any
transfer pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii), each transferee shall agree to be
bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein and provided, further,
that the undersigned provides at least two business days prior written
notice to the Company if the  undersigned or the recipient is required to file a report under Section 16
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, reporting a reduction in
beneficial ownership of Common Stock during the restricted period described
above. For purposes of this Lock-Up Agreement, "immediate family" shall mean
any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than first
cousin. The undersigned now has, and, except as contemplated by clauses (i)
through (iii) above, for the duration of this Lock-Up Agreement will have,
good and marketable title to the Shares (to the extent they remain subject to
the restrictions under this Lock-Up Agreement), free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances, and claims whatsoever. The undersigned also agrees and consents
to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the Companys transfer agent
and registrar against the transfer of the Shares except in compliance with
the foregoing restrictions.

The undersigned understands that the Company is relying upon this Lock-Up
Agreement in proceeding toward consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Arrangement Agreement. The undersigned further understands that this
Lock-Up Agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigneds
heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns.

This Lock-Up Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.
