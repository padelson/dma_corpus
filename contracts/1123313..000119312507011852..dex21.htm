("Parent"), Neptune Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and St. Francis Medical
Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and with respect
to Article VII only, Philip M. Young, as Stockholders Representative.

_RECITALS_

A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
corporations and stockholders that Parent and the Company consummate the
business combination and other transactions provided for herein in order to
advance their respective long-term strategic business interests.

B. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved, in accordance with applicable provisions of the laws of the
State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"), this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (as defined in Section 1.1).

C. Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
stockholders of the Company representing the requisite number of shares of
each class of the Companys capital stock will, through an action by written
consent (the "Stockholder Approval"), adopt this Agreement.

D. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation. The Company, as the surviving
corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation." 

1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "Certificate of Merger")
(the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(or such later time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and
specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date (as defined below). The closing of
the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, located at One Market, San
Francisco, California, at a time and date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those that by
their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), or at such other
time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions
of Delaware Law, including Section 259 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, until thereafter amended in accordance with
Delaware Law and as provided in such Certificate of Incorporation; _provided_
, _however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is "St. Francis
Medical Technologies, Inc." At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be

receive payment of an amount in cash (in addition to any amounts payable
pursuant to Section 1.7) equal to the excess, if any, of the product of the
Per Share Consideration and the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock deliverable upon exercise of such Company Option (regardless of whether
or not any such Company Option is then "vested" or exercisable) (the "Option
Shares") over the aggregate exercise price of such Option Shares (the right
to receive such cash payment for each Option Share, a "Cash Payment Right").
Each Cash Payment Right shall be vested as of the Effective Time to the extent
the Company Option so converted in accordance with this Section 1.6(d) is
vested as of the Effective Time (after taking into account the accelerated
vesting set forth in Section 5.7(f)(i)). At the Closing, each vested Cash
Payment Right shall be paid to the holder thereof, and each unvested Cash

assemblage of products containing one or more components other than an IPD

Second Earnout Revenue and (ii) two (2); _provided_ , _however_ , if the sum

each Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the following
amounts (the "Deferred Payments"):

(1) On the First Deferred Payment Date, an amount (the "Initial
Deferred Payment") equal to such Company Stockholders Pro Rata Portion (as
defined in Section 7.1) of the First Earnout Amount, subject to any set-off
pursuant to Article VII; and

(2) On the Second Deferred Payment Date, an amount (the "Final Deferred
Payment") equal to such Company Stockholders Pro Rata Portion (as defined in
Section 7.1) of the Second Earnout Amount, subject to any set-off pursuant to

Stockholder pursuant to this Section 1.7(b) unless and until such Company
Stockholder shall have surrendered such Company Stockholders Certificates and
delivered a duly completed letter of transmittal in accordance with Section
1.8(c).

(c) _Calculation of Earnout Amount_. (i) On or prior to thirty (30) calendar
days after the respective earnout period (forty-five (45) calendar days in the
case of the first earnout period), Parent shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Stockholders Representative a statement setting forth
Parents calculation of the Earnout Amount (the "Earnout Statement"), together
with reasonable supporting information.

(ii) After receipt of the Earnout Statement, the Stockholders Representative
shall have thirty (30) calendar days to review the Earnout Statement. Unless
the Stockholders Representative delivers written notice (the "Dispute
Notice") to Parent setting forth the items disputed by the Stockholders
Representative on or prior to the 30th calendar day after delivery of the
Earnout Statement, the Stockholders Representative will be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to the Earnout Statement, and the Earnout Statement (and
the calculation of the Earnout Amount contained therein) will be final,
binding and conclusive; _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to the First
Earnout Amount, the Stockholders Representative may, upon delivery of
written notice to Parent during such thirty-day period, elect to resolve such
First Earnout Amount at the same time



 

-6- that the Second Earnout Amount is resolved. During such thirty-day period,
Parent shall provide the Stockholders Representative with reasonable access
to Parents books, records and personnel in order to permit the Stockholders
Representative to verify the calculation of the Earnout Amount. If the
Stockholders Representative delivers a Dispute Notice in a timely manner,
Parent and the Stockholders Representative will, within thirty (30) calendar
days following delivery of such notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt in
good faith to resolve their differences in writing with respect to the items
specified in the Dispute Notice (the "Disputed Items"). Any resolution by
Parent and the Stockholders Representative during the Resolution Period as to
any Disputed Items will be final, binding and conclusive.

(iii) If Parent and the Stockholders Representative do not resolve all
Disputed Items by the end of the Resolution Period, then all Disputed Items
remaining in dispute will be promptly submitted to KPMG LLP (the "Neutral
Arbitrator"). If requested by the Neutral Arbitrator, Parent and the
Stockholders Representative agree to execute a reasonable engagement letter.
The Neutral Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine only those
Disputed Items remaining in dispute, consistent with this Section 1.7(c) and
shall request a statement from each of Parent and the Stockholders
Representative regarding such Disputed Items. Each of Parent and the
Stockholders Representative will pay its own fees and expenses incurred with
respect to the resolution of the Disputed Items. All fees and
expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral
Arbitrator will be allocated between Parent and the Stockholders
Representative in the same proportion that (i) the extent to which the
Disputed Items so submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator are unsuccessfully
disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the Neutral Arbitrator)
bears to (ii) the total amount of such Disputed Items so submitted. The
Neutral Arbitrator will deliver to Parent and the Stockholders
Representative a written determination (such determination to include a work
sheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination and to be based on independent review and audit of the Revenue
upon which the Earnout Amount is based) of the Disputed Items by the Neutral
Arbitrator within forty-five (45) calendar days after receipt of such Disputed
Items (or as soon thereafter as practicable), which determination will be
final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered on the award.

(d) _Obligations of Parent_. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to market, promote, sell and distribute the IPD Devices in the United States,
and such efforts shall include, to the extent commercially reasonable, (i) the
development of marketing, sales and training materials, as Parent reasonably
deems appropriate, for the IPD Devices, (ii) educating medical professionals
specializing in spinal procedures on the use of the IPD Devices, and (iii)
displaying the IPD Devices at meetings where attending medical professionals
specialize in spinal procedures; _provided_ , _however_ , it shall not be
deemed to be commercially reasonable to take any action if to do so would
violate applicable Legal Requirements or any intellectual property rights of
any third party.

 

(e) _No Security_. The parties understand and agree that (i) the Per Share
Earnout Amounts payable under this Section 1.7 are an integral part of the
Merger consideration payable hereunder, (ii) the rights to receive such
amounts will not be represented by any form of certificate, are not
transferable, except by operation of law



 

-7- (including, without limitation, laws relating to descent and distribution,
divorce and community property), and do not constitute an equity or ownership
interest in Parent or the Surviving Corporation, (iii) no Company Stockholder
shall have any rights as a security holder of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent as a result of such Company Stockholders right to receive the Per
Share Earnout Amounts, and (iv) no interest is payable with respect to the Per
Share Earnout Amounts.

(f)  _Acceleration_. The Earnout Amount of $200,000,000, less any Earnout
Amount previously paid, subject to any set-off pursuant to Article VII, shall
become immediately due and payable by Parent, such amount to be paid within
three (3) business days of any of the following: (i) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation commences any proceeding in bankruptcy or for dissolution,
liquidation, winding-up, or other relief under state or federal bankruptcy
laws; (ii) such proceedings are commenced against Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, or a receiver or trustee is appointed for Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or a substantial part of its respective property, and such
proceeding or appointment is not dismissed or discharged within sixty (60)
days after its commencement, (iii) Parent or the Surviving Corporation is
unable to, or admits in writing its inability to, pay its debts when they
become due; (iv) Parent or the Surviving Corporation makes an assignment for
the benefit of creditors, or petitions or applies to any tribunal for the
appointment of a custodian, receiver or trustee for it or a substantial
portion of its assets or has a receiver, custodian or trustee appointed for
all or a substantial portion of its assets; (v) a Change of Control; or (vi)
Parent or the Surviving Corporation takes any action effectuating, approving
or consenting to any of the foregoing.

1.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a)  _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall select its transfer agent or another
nationally recognized exchange agent to act as the exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") in the Merger, which agent shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Company.

(b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter
into an agreement with the Exchange Agent which shall provide that, prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for
exchange in accordance with this Article I, the Merger Consideration (as
defined in Section 7.1), _less_ the sum of (i) the Representative
Reimbursement Amount (as defined in Section 7.1), and (ii) the amount to be
deposited in escrow pursuant to the Management Escrow Agreement in exchange
for Company Capital Stock and Company Options. The portion of
the Representative Reimbursement Amount contributed following the Effective
Time with respect to each Company Stockholder (as defined in Section 7.1) as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be in proportion to the
aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration each such stockholder would
otherwise be entitled to receive in the Merger by virtue of ownership of
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Options immediately
prior to the Effective Time (treating, for purposes of this calculation, all
Company Options and Company Restricted Stock as having fully vested and with
respect to Company Options net of exercise prices). Any cash deposited with
the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."



 

-8- (c) _Exchange Procedures_. Within two (2) business days following the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available for hand pick-up from the
Exchange Agent and cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
(as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates or an instrument
or instruments (the "Certificates"), which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented (i) outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 1.6(a) and (ii) the Company Options which were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(d): (A) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as are reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for cash constituting the Merger Consideration (less the
Representative Reimbursement Amount with respect to such Company Stockholder
in accordance with Article VII, and amounts to be deposited in escrow
pursuant to the Management Escrow Agreement) (including a means of hand
delivery). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
record of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive, in exchange
therefor, the amount of cash constituting the Merger Consideration to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 (less the Representative
Reimbursement Amount with respect to such Company Stockholder in accordance
with Article VII and amounts to be deposited in escrow pursuant to the
Management Escrow Agreement), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash
constituting the Merger Consideration, other than with respect to amounts to
be deposited in escrow pursuant to the Management Escrow Agreement. At the
election of the respective Company Stockholder, the Exchange Agent shall make
the foregoing payment by wire transfer to the extent that the aggregate amount
owed to any such holder at the Closing is in excess of $1,000,000. Until so
surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and the Earnout Amount into which such securities
shall have been so converted.

(d) _Required Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any other consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Capital
Stock or Company Options such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any
other applicable Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.2(d)). To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such
consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person (as defined in Section 9.2(d)) to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid.



 

-9- (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.8, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_
, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of the Companys securities pursuant to this Article I. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to holders of
the Companys securities pursuant to this Article I shall promptly be paid to
Parent.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise according to the
instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates
who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section
1.8 shall after such delivery to Surviving Corporation look only to Parent and
the Surviving Corporation for the amount of cash constituting the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a) with respect to the shares of
Company Capital Stock, or Section 1.6(d) with respect to Company Options and
the Earnout Amount pursuant to Section 1.7 with respect to such shares and
Company Options formerly represented thereby. If any Certificate shall not
have been surrendered immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity (as defined
in Section 2.3(c)), any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed
by holders of the Companys securities immediately prior to such time shall,
to the extent permitted by law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

1.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock and Company
Options in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Capital Stock and Company Options, and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article I.

1.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall transfer
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by
Parent, the giving by the holder thereof of an indemnity undertaking with
respect to any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, such amount of cash constituting the Merger Consideration and,
at the applicable time, any amount payable pursuant to Section 1.7.



 

-10- 1.11 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Subsidiaries has received from any Governmental Entity any (i) written notice
indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, (ii) written request

or adjustment proposed in writing of any amount of Tax against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. No proceedings are pending or being conducted with
respect to any Tax matter and no power of attorney (other than powers of
attorney authorizing employees of the Company to act on behalf of
the Company) with respect to any Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has been filed or executed with any Governmental Entity. There
are no matters under discussion with any Governmental Entity with respect to
Taxes that are likely to result in an additional liability for Taxes with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has delivered

the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (and predecessors of each) for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, and complete and accurate copies

have the provisions of former Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any
disposition of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) has
not agreed, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries required, to make
any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in
accounting method or otherwise; (iii) has not made an election, nor is the

grievances pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, relating

ordinary course of business for sums not yet due and payable, (c) Liens

debtors and rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief, or
other equitable remedies) and there is not, under any of the Leases, any
material default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, by and other party thereto, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a material default thereunder by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other party thereto. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
performed all of their respective obligations in all material respects under
any termination agreements pursuant to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries have terminated any leases or subleases of real property
that are no longer in effect and have no continuing liability with respect to

Property (such items being the subject of Section 2.9).

material liability. The Company and its Subsidiaries have made available for
inspection by Parent all environmental audits and environmental assessments

Significant Customer that such entity shall not continue as a customer of the

such customer intends to terminate or materially modify existing Contracts
with the Company (or the Surviving Corporation or Parent). The Company has

concerning products and/or services provided by any of Invibio, Inc., RMS
Company or Sterigenics (each, a "Significant Supplier"). The Company has not

constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms,
except (A) as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally and general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (B) as the remedy of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be

third party under, or give to others any rights of termination, material
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a

3.4 _Compliance; Permits_.

with, or in default or in violation of, any Legal Requirement applicable to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses or properties is bound or
affected, except for those conflicts, defaults or violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not cause Parent to lose any material
benefit or incur any material liability. No investigation or review by any
Governmental Entity is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, has been
threatened, against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no material
judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries which has or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or materially impairing any material business practice of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, any acquisition of material property by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or the conduct of business by Parent and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

(b) _Permits_. Parent and its Subsidiaries hold, to the extent legally
required, all Permits that required for the operation of the business of
Parent, as currently conducted, the failure to hold which would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent (collectively, "Parent
Permits"). Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of the Parent Permits.

3.5 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there are no Legal Proceedings
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, that seeks to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or which would reasonably be expected, either
singularly or in the aggregate with all such Legal Proceedings, to materially
impact Parents ability to pay the Merger Consideration or the Earnout
Amount.

3.6 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

(a) _SEC Filings_. Parent has filed all required registration statements,
prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated by
reference) required to be filed by it with



 

-37- the SEC since February 1, 2003. Parent has made available to the Company all
such registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents in the form filed with the SEC that are not
publicly available through the SECs EDGAR database. All such required
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents are referred to herein as the "Parent SEC Reports." As of
their respective dates, the Parent SEC Reports complied as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Reports. The Parent SEC Reports did
not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date hereof, none of Parents Subsidiaries is
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. As of the
date hereof, Parent has previously furnished to the Company a complete and
correct copy of any amendments or modifications which have not yet been filed
with the SEC, but which are required to be filed, to agreements, documents or
other instruments which previously had been filed by Parent with the SEC
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. As of the date hereof,
there are no unresolved comments issued by the staff of the SEC with respect
to any of the Parent SEC Reports.

(b) _Financial Statements_. Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Parent
SEC Reports (the "Parent Financials"): (i) complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may be
permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under
the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of Parents
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, as permitted by
GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC). The
balance sheet of Parent contained in the Parent SEC Reports as of September
30, 2006, is hereinafter referred to as the "Parent Balance Sheet." Other than
liabilities (A) disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports or (B) incurred since the
date of the Parent Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a nature
required by GAAP to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet or in the
notes thereto which, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except as disclosed in
the Parent SEC Reports, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the
SEC).

(c) _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting



 

-38- as such terms are defined and as required by Rules 13a 15 and 15d 15 under the
Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, and such assessment concluded that
such controls were effective and Parents independent registered accountant
has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation
report concluding that Parent maintained effective internal controls over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. The principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of Parent have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC. Parent has established and maintains, adheres to and
enforces a system of internal control over financial reporting, which are
effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations
of management and the Board of Directors of Parent, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Parents assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(d) _Sarbanes-Oxley Act; Nasdaq_. Parent is in material compliance in all
material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of Nasdaq.

3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as set forth in the Parent
SEC Reports, since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet there has not been any
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

3.8 _Intellectual Property_.

(a) _No Infringement_. To the Knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof, the
products, services and operations of Parent do not infringe or misappropriate
the valid and enforceable Intellectual Property of any third party where such
infringement or misappropriation, individually or in the aggregate, would be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.



 

-39- (b) _No Impairment_. To the Knowledge of Parent, the consummation of the
Merger will not result in the termination or breach of any Contract directly
related to Intellectual Property to which Parent is a party, which termination
or breach would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

(c) _All Necessary Intellectual Property_. To the Knowledge of Parent, Parent
and its Subsidiaries own or otherwise have sufficient rights to
all Intellectual Property used in and/or necessary to the conduct of the
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as it currently is conducted, and as
it is currently planned to be conducted by Parent and its Subsidiaries, except
as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

(d) _No Notice of Infringement_. To the Knowledge of Parent, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice from any third party
that the operation of the business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
act, product or service of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, infringes or
misappropriates the Intellectual Property of any third party or constitutes
unfair competition or unfair trade practices under the laws of any
jurisdiction except as would not otherwise reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(e) _Proprietary Information Agreements_. Parent and its Subsidiaries have
taken commercially reasonable steps to protect Parents and its Subsidiaries
rights in Parents confidential information and trade secrets that it wishes
to protect or any trade secrets or confidential information of third parties
provided to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and, without limiting the
foregoing, each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has and enforces a policy
requiring each Employee to execute a proprietary information and
confidentiality agreement substantially in Parents standard form of
confidentiality and proprietary information and invention disclosure and
assignment agreement, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, all Employees of Parent
and any of its Subsidiaries who are involved in the development of material
Intellectual Property of the Parent or its Subsidiaries have executed such an
agreement, except where the failure to do any of the foregoing is not
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

3.9 _Availability of Funds_. Parent has made available to the Company a true,
accurate, complete and fully executed copy of a commitment letter (the
"Financing Commitment"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, Bank of America, N.A. (the "Lender") has committed to
provide Parent with financing (the "Financing"). As of the date hereof, the
Financing Commitment is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn
or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect and Parent is
not in breach of any conditions set forth therein. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a breach on the part of Parent under any term or
condition of the Financing Commitment. The proceeds from the Financing,
together with cash on hand, constitute all of the financing required to
be provided by Parent for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of Parents obligations to pay
the Merger Consideration and the Earnout Amount.

all provisions contained in this Section 5.7 with respect to employees are

number of shares of Company Restricted Stock that would have become vested
upon a change in control of the Company pursuant to such agreement are
vested, and (D) at least fifty percent (50%) of the total remaining unvested
shares of Company Restricted Stock are vested, after giving effect to clauses

Time. The cash payable under Section 1.6(a) with respect to each share of
Company Restricted Stock which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, after
giving effect to the preceding sentence, remains subject to vesting and
transfer or other restrictions (together with the



 

-50- unvested Cash Payment Rights represented by the unvested Option Shares as of
the Effective Time (after giving effect to the acceleration of vesting set
forth in Section 5.7(f)(i)), "Management Shares") shall be paid into escrow
pursuant to the terms of the Management Escrow Agreement. No holder of any
Management Shares shall have any right to any Deferred Payment with respect
to any such shares unless and until the cash payable under Section 1.6(a) with
respect to such shares shall have vested.

5.8 _Indemnification_.

(a) For the period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes, prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Indemnified Parties")
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments
or amounts that are paid in settlement, in each case to the extent actually
and reasonably incurred with the approval of the indemnifying party, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the "Company
Indemnified Liabilities") of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation by reason of the fact that such person is or was
a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after the
Effective Time and all Company Indemnified Liabilities based on, or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (to the extent that
such losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or
amounts arose from or are related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby), in each case to the full extent a corporation is
permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL to indemnify its own directors, officers
and employees (the "Company Indemnified Proceedings"). In the event any
Company Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any Company Indemnified
Proceeding, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such Company Indemnified
Proceeding to each Company Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by
law upon receipt of any undertaking contemplated by Section 145 of the DGCL.
Subject to the foregoing, in the event any such Company Indemnified
Proceeding is brought against any Company Indemnified Party, (i) the Company
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel of their choosing, who shall be
reasonably acceptable to Parent, (ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay all reasonable and documented fees and expenses
of one counsel for all of the Company Indemnified Parties with respect to each
such Company Indemnified Proceeding unless there is, under applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between
the positions of any two or more Company Indemnified Parties, in which case
Parent shall pay the fees of such additional counsel required by such
conflict, promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
for any settlement of any claim effected without its written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any Company
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.8(a)
upon becoming aware of any such Company Indemnified Proceeding shall promptly
notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation (but the failure to so notify
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve Parent or the



 

-51- Surviving Corporation from any liability it may have under this Section 5.8(a)
except to the extent such failure prejudices Parent or the Surviving
Corporation), and shall deliver to Parent and the Surviving Corporation the
undertaking contemplated by Section 145 of the DGCL.

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent will,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements
between the Company and the Company Indemnified Parties, subject to applicable
law. For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at
least as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as those contained in
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
Company Indemnified Parties.

(c) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain directors and officers liability
insurance covering those Persons who are covered by the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy as of the date hereof in an amount
and on terms no less favorable than those applicable to the current directors
and officers of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an annual premium for the ("DandO
Insurance") in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company; _provided_ , _further_ , if such coverage cannot be obtained for such
amounts, Parent shall provide the maximum amount of coverage as may be
obtained for such amounts. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent may obtain, or
request that the Company obtain at Parents expense, from such insurance
carrier extended reporting period coverage under the Companys existing
officers and directors insurance policies.

(d) This Section 5.8 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the Company Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the obligations
set forth with respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, in this Section 5.8.

5.9 _Certain Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_. Parent shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file all Tax Returns of the Company
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are filed after the Closing Date and, subject
to the Company Stockholders indemnification obligations hereunder, shall pay
all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. Parent shall permit the
Stockholders Representative to review and comment on each material Tax Return
prior to filing. 



 

-52- (b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent, the Company, and the Company
Stockholders shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to
this Agreement and any Action or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.

(c) _Tax Claims_. If, subsequent to the Closing, any of Parent, the Company or
the Company Stockholders receives notice of a claim by any Governmental
Entity, that, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment hereunder (a
"Tax Claim"), then within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, the
party receiving such notice shall give written notice of such Tax Claim to
the other parties. Parent shall have the right to control the conduct and
resolution of any such Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the resolution of any
such Tax Claim (or any portion thereof) may affect the Taxes of the Company
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, then the Stockholders Representative and Parent
shall jointly control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Claim (or
portion thereof). The Stockholders Representative and Parent shall jointly
control the conduct and resolution of any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle
Period as defined in Section 7.1. If the Company Stockholders elect not to
participate in the conduct and resolution of any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period, the Stockholders Representative
shall notify Parent in writing and Parent shall have the right to control the
conduct and resolution of such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall keep the Stockholders Representative informed of all
developments on a timely basis and Parent shall not resolve such Tax Claim in
a manner that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the
Indemnifying Parties indemnification obligations under this Agreement without
the written consent of the Stockholders Representative, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Each party shall bear its own costs incurred in
participating in any proceeding relating to any Tax Claim.

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other substantially similar Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by the Company Stockholders
when due, and the Company Stockholders will, at their own expense, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable law, Parent will, and will cause
its affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. The Company Stockholders shall provide Parent with evidence
satisfactory to Parent that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by the Company
Stockholders.

(e) _Characterization of Payments_. Any payments made to any Parent
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute an adjustment
of the consideration paid for the Company Common Stock for Tax purposes and
shall be treated as such by the parties hereto on their Tax Returns to the
extent permitted by law.



 

-53- (f) _Parachute Payment Waivers_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent, prior to the initiation of the
requisite stockholder approval procedure under Section 5.9(g), a Parachute
Payment Waiver, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
("Parachute Payment Waiver"), from each Person who the Company reasonably
believes is, with respect to the Company, and/or any ERISA Affiliate, a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to
the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under Section
5.9(g), and who might otherwise have, receive or have the right or entitlement
to receive a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) to the extent the value
thereof exceeds 2.99 times such Persons base amount determined in accordance
with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the requisite stockholder approval of such accelerated vesting,
payments, benefits, options and stock is obtained pursuant to Section 5.9(g).

(g) _Section 280G of the Code_. If the Company is obligated to make any
payments, or is a party to any agreement that under certain circumstances
could obligate it to make any payments, that will not be deductible under
Section 280G of the Code if the shareholder approval requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) are not satisfied and if that shareholder approval has
not already been obtained, the Company agrees that it shall cooperate and
assist Parent in obtaining the requisite shareholder approval described in
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, Parent agrees that it shall cooperate and
assist the Company in obtaining such shareholder approval and the Company
agrees that it shall use commercially reasonably efforts to obtain such
shareholder approval promptly after the date hereof and in any event prior to
the date on which the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated.

5.10 _Third Party Consents_. Except for the Necessary Consents, Parent
acknowledges that certain consents and waivers with respect to the Merger may
be required from parties to Contracts to which the Company is a party and that
such consents and waivers have not been obtained. Parent agrees that the
Company and its Affiliates shall not have any liability whatsoever to Parent
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or waivers
that may be required in connection with the Merger or because of the
termination of any Contract as a result thereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
the foregoing shall not be deemed to modify any of the Companys
representations and warranties in Article II or any liability of the Company
and its Affiliates for any breach or violations thereof. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent, upon the request of Parent, in any
reasonable manner in connection with Parent obtaining any such consents and
waivers and providing any required notices; _provided_ that such cooperation
shall not include any requirement of the Company or any of its Affiliates to
expend money, commence, defend or participate in any litigation or offer or
grant any material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third Person.

5.11 _Merger Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all
of Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub
shall not engage in any business which is not in connection with the merger
with and into the Company pursuant to this Agreement.

balances under the Loan and Security Agreement, by and between the Company
and Silicon Valley Bank, dated April 24, 2006 (the "Credit Facility") to be

all related liens and security interests, at or prior to Closing.

satisfy any indemnification or other obligations to Parent hereunder.

7.4 _Set-Off From Earnout Amount_.

(a) The Earnout Amount shall be available to compensate each of the
Indemnified Parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by each such
Indemnified Party resulting from (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in Article II of this Agreement (as
modified by the Company Disclosure Letter), (ii) any failure by the Company to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in
this Agreement prior to the Closing Date, (iii) any inaccuracy in the
information contained in the Closing Certificate and (iv) the amount paid with
respect to each Dissenting Share that exceeds the amount that would have been
payable with respect to such Dissenting Share, were such share not a
Dissenting Share (after taking into account any set-off pursuant to this
Article VII).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Earnout
Amount shall not be available to compensate any of the Indemnified Parties for
any Losses under Section 7.4(a)(i), and no Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to recover from the Earnout Amount, unless and until the Indemnified Parties
have incurred Losses in excess of $3,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Deductible
Amount"), and with respect to any



 

-59- given claim for Losses, such claim is individually in excess of $35,000 (the
"Threshold Amount"), after which the Earnout Amount, subject to the terms of
this Article VII, shall be available to compensate each of the Indemnified
Parties for any Losses, and, subject to the terms of this Article VII, the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek recovery for such Losses that
are in excess of the Deductible Amount in the aggregate and the Threshold
Amount individually; _provided_ , _however_ , the limitations in this Section
7.4(b) shall not apply with respect to those representations and warranties
contained in Sections 2.2, 2.3(a) and 2.12, and the Threshold Amount shall not
apply with respect to those representations and warranties contained in
Section 2.2. In no event shall the aggregate indemnification available to the
Indemnified Parties under this Agreement exceed five percent (5%) of the sum
of the Merger Consideration and the Total Earnout Amount, except in the case
of fraud.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: (i) no claim
for Loss related to or arising from (A) the value or condition of any Tax
asset of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (B) the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their affiliates to utilize such Tax asset following
the Effective Time, shall be subject to a claim for recovery by any
Indemnified Party hereunder; (ii) any Losses recoverable from the Earnout
Amount hereunder shall be reduced in amount by any insurance proceeds that may
be realized by any Indemnified Party, and Parent and the Indemnified Parties
shall, as a condition to receiving any amounts from the Earnout Amount or
otherwise seeking recovery hereunder, use all reasonable efforts to realize
such benefits or proceeds; and (iii) if the amount of any Losses recoverable
from the Earnout Amount hereunder gives rise to a reduction in the Tax
liability of the Indemnified Party making the claim (a "Tax Benefit") or an
increase in the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party making the claim (a
"Tax Detriment"), then the indemnification payment shall be reduced by the
amount of the cumulative net Tax Benefit and/or increased by the amount of the
cumulative net Tax Detriment actually realized by the Indemnified Party on its
Tax Returns from the incurrence or payment of such Losses. For purposes of
the foregoing sentence, (A) the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have
"actually realized" a net Tax Benefit to the extent that the amount of Taxes
payable by the Indemnified Party as shown on the Indemnified Partys Tax
Return for the year in which the Losses are incurred, any year to which a
deduction or loss attributable to such Losses is carried back, or any of the
three (3) succeeding Tax years thereafter, is reduced below the amount of
Taxes that the Indemnified Party would have been required to pay but for the
incurrence or payment of such Losses, and (B) the Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax Detriment to the extent that the
amount of Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party as shown on the Indemnified
Partys Tax Return for the year in which the Losses are incurred or any of the
five (5) succeeding Tax years thereafter is increased over the amount
of Taxes that the Indemnified Party would have been required to pay but for
the incurrence or payment of such Losses. If the cumulative Tax Benefit or Tax
Detriment is actually realized in a year other than that in which the
indemnification payment is made, the Indemnified Party shall pay the amount
of the cumulative net Tax Benefit to the indemnifying party, or the
indemnifying party shall pay the amount of the cumulative net Tax Detriment to
the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, within 30 days of the filing of
the Tax Return in which the net Tax Benefit or net Tax Detriment is actually
realized. If the Indemnified Party has other losses, deductions, credits or
similar items available to it,



 

-60- the losses, deductions, credits or similar items attributable to the
incurrence or payment of the Losses shall be treated as the last items
utilized to produce a net Tax Benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, as a
result of a "final determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, the amount of any such net Tax Benefit is decreased or
the amount of any such net Tax Detriment is increased, then the Indemnified
Party or the indemnifying party, as the case may be, shall pay to the other
party an amount such that the aggregate amount paid to the other party equals
the amount that would have been paid had the result of the "final
determination" been taken into account in the original calculation of the
amount of net Tax Benefit or net Tax Detriment resulting from the incurrence
of the Losses. 

(d) No Losses shall be recoverable hereunder that constitute punitive,
incidental, indirect or special damages, except in the event of
an intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud.

(e) All claims for recovery for any Loss or Losses from the Earnout Amount
under this Agreement shall be made pursuant to and in accordance with, and be
governed by the terms of, this Agreement.

7.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the event of fraud, (a) set-off from the
Earnout Amount in an amount not to exceed five percent (5%) of the sum of the
Merger Consideration and the Total Earnout Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties for any Losses incurred by any
Indemnified Party, and (b) no Company Stockholder shall be liable to Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Indemnified Party for any damages or other
remedies arising out of, in connection with or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein.

7.6 _Distribution of Earnout Amount_. Upon the First Deferred Payment Date,
there shall be set-off from the Initial Deferred Payment an amount, which, in
the reasonable judgment of Parent, subject to the objection of
the Stockholders Representative and the subsequent litigation of the claim
in the manner provided in Section 7.10, is necessary to satisfy any
unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the
Stockholders Representative on or prior to the earlier of the
Indemnification Termination Date and the First Deferred Payment Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such amount shall not exceed five percent (5%)
of the sum of (x) the Merger Consideration and (y) the First Earnout Amount,
and any such excess for which no set-off is made shall, subject to the
limitations in Section 7.4(b), be eligible for set-off against the Final
Deferred Payment. As soon as all such claims have been resolved, Parent shall
deliver the remaining portion of the Initial Deferred Payment, if any, not
required to satisfy such claims to the Company Stockholders. Upon the Second
Deferred Payment Date, the Final Deferred Payment shall promptly be delivered
to the Company Stockholders; provided, however, that there shall be set-off
from the Final Deferred Payment an amount, which, in the reasonable judgment
of Parent, subject to the objection of the Stockholders Representative
and the subsequent litigation of the claim in the manner provided in Section
7.10, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any
Officers Certificate delivered to the Stockholders Representative on or
prior to the earlier of the



 

-61- Indemnification Termination Date and the Final Deferred Payment Date
(including any amount provided for in the proviso to the first sentence of
this Section 7.6); _provided_ , _however_ , that such amount, together with
all amounts set-off with respect to resolved claims pursuant to this Section
7.6, shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the sum of (x) the Merger
Consideration and (y) the Total Earnout Amount. As soon as all such claims
have been resolved, Parent shall deliver the remaining portion of the Second
Earnout Amount not required to satisfy such claims by Indemnified Parties
hereunder to the Company Stockholders at such time that any such claims are
resolved. Deliveries to the Company Stockholders pursuant to this Section 7.6
shall be made in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portion of the
amount distributed, with each amount rounded to the nearest whole cent
($0.01).

7.7 _Stockholders  Representative_.

(a) By virtue of the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the requisite
consent of the Company Stockholders, each of the Company Stockholders
(other than such Company Stockholders, if any, who have perfected dissenters
or appraisal rights under Delaware or the applicable laws of the State of
California) shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Philip M. Young as its
agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Stockholders Representative") for and on
behalf of the Stockholders to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Earnout Amount in
satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments,
to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified
Party against any Company Stockholder or by any such Company Stockholder
against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and
any such Stockholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically
mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the
Company Stockholders with the right to a majority of the Pro Rata Portions of
the Earnout Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholders
Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest of
the Earnout Amount agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders
Representative may resign at any time by providing written notice of intent to
resign to the Company Stockholders, which resignation shall be effective upon
the earlier of (A) thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of such
written notice or (B) the appointment of a successor by the holders of a
majority in interest of the Earnout Amount. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholders Representative, and the Stockholders Representative shall not
receive any compensation for its services.

(b) The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to the Company
Stockholders for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders
Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
judgment, even if such act or omission constitutes negligence on the part of
such Stockholders Representative. The



 

-62- Stockholders Representative shall only have the duties expressly stated in
this Agreement and shall have no other duty, express or implied. The
Stockholders Representative may engage attorneys, accountants and other
professionals and experts. The Stockholders Representative may in good faith
rely conclusively upon information, reports, statements and opinions prepared
or presented by such professionals, and any action taken by the Stockholders
Representative based on such reliance shall be deemed conclusively to have
been taken in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The
Company Stockholders shall indemnify the Stockholders Representative and hold
the Stockholders Representative harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred on the part of the Stockholders Representative (so long
as the Stockholders Representative was acting in good faith in connection
therewith) and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Stockholders Representatives duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by
the Stockholders Representative ("Stockholders Representative Expenses").
The Stockholders Representative shall have the right to retain Stockholders
Representative Expenses from the Representative Reimbursement Amount prior to
any distribution to the Company Stockholders. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders Representative, including an
amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.4 or
8.5 hereof, shall constitute a decision of the Company Stockholders and shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company Stockholders.

(c) The Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the
instructions and decisions of the Stockholders Representative with respect
to the indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders under this
Article VII, including the defense or settlement of any claims or the making
of payments with respect thereto, or as to any other actions required or
permitted to be taken by the Stockholders Representative hereunder
(including any amendment or waiver under Sections 8.4 and 8.5).

7.8  _Third-Party Claims_. In the event that an Indemnified Party becomes
aware of a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") that the Indemnified
Party reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification pursuant
to this Article VII, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholders
Representative of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , the failure of Parent
to so give notice shall not relieve the Company Stockholders of their
obligations under this Article VII, except to the extent that such failure
has materially prejudiced the rights of the Company Stockholders. The
Stockholders Representative may, at his or her election, undertake and
conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, if the Stockholders Representative
delivers notice to Parent and the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
calendar days after receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim, which notice
shall specify that the Third Party Claim is one for which such Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII; _provided_
, _however_ , the Stockholder Representative shall have no right to undertake
and conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim if (a) any Losses in respect
of such Third Party Claim are reasonably likely to exceed five percent (5%) of
the sum of the Merger Consideration and the Total Earnout Amount, reduced by
a reasonable estimate of the amount of all pending claims, or (b) it seeks as
a remedy the imposition of an equitable remedy. Parent shall be entitled to



 

-63- participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of any Third
Party Claim that Stockholders Representative elects to undertake and conduct
pursuant to this Section 7.8. The Stockholders Representative shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) enter into any
settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim that does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such claim
to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with
respect to such claim, or (ii) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim if
the settlement or compromise imposes equitable remedies or material
obligations on the Indemnified Party other than financial obligations for
which such Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder, or in any way
restricts or adversely affects the future conduct or activity of the
Indemnified Parties. If the Stockholders Representative does not so elect to
undertake and conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 7.8, Parent shall undertake the defense of and
use all reasonable efforts to defend such claim and shall keep the
Stockholders Representative reasonably apprised of the status thereof;
_provided however_ , that Parent shall have the right in its reasonable
discretion to settle any such claim; _provided_ , _further_ , that except with
the consent of the Stockholders Representative, no settlement of any such
Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of the
amount of Losses relating to such matter.

7.9 _No Other Representations and Warranties._  

(a) Each of the Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has made
its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the Company and its businesses and
operations, and Parent and Merger Sub have been furnished with or given full
access to such information about the Company and its businesses and operations
as they requested. In connection with Parents and Merger Subs investigation
of the Company and its businesses and operations, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective representatives have received from the Company or its
representatives, certain projections and other forecasts for the Company and
certain estimates, plans and budget information. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets; (ii)
Parent and Merger Sub are familiar with such uncertainties; and (iii) Parent
and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluations
of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans
and budgets so furnished to them or their representatives.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties
shall have no claim or right to recovery pursuant to this Article VII or
otherwise, and none of the Indemnified Parties or any other person shall have
or be subject to any liability to Merger Sub, Parent, the Indemnified Parties
or any other person, with respect to (i) any information, documents or
materials furnished, delivered or made available by the Company or its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors to Parent or
Merger Sub, in certain "data rooms", management presentations or any other
form in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) any
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenue,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or



 

-64- future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or the
future business, operations or affairs of the Company heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
representatives or Affiliates.

7.10 _Resolution of Claims_.

(a) In the case of any claim or claims for Losses (each a "Claim") specified
in an Officers Certificate pursuant to Section 7.6, the Stockholders
Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of such
Officers Certificate to deliver written notice (an "Objection Notice") of
objection to Parent, which shall state in reasonable detail the basis for such
objection. If the Stockholders Representative shall fail to deliver an
Objection Notice within such 30-day period, such Claim and such Losses shall
be deemed to be final, binding and conclusive and Parent shall be entitled to
retain the amount thereof from the Earnout Amount. If the Stockholders
Representative shall timely deliver an Objection Notice, the
Stockholders Representative and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good
faith for thirty (30) calendar days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. Any resolution by such
Indemnified Party and the Stockholders Representative during such period
will be final, binding and conclusive.

(b) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
the Indemnified Party or the Stockholders Representative may bring suit in
the State courts of California and to the jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for Northern District of California. Upon final nonappealable
judicial resolution of such Claim and such Losses, Parent shall be entitled to
retain the amount thereof from the Earnout Amount.

ARTICLE VIII.

before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
this Agreement;



 

-65- (d) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall have issued

set forth in Section 5.4(a), this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX,
each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (b) nothing

of all such entity and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. An exception or
disclosure made in Company Disclosure Letter with regard to a representation
of the Company, or in the Parent Disclosure Letter with regard to a
representation of Parent or Merger Sub, shall be deemed made with respect to
any other representation by such party to which such exception or disclosure
is reasonably apparent.

Person means a Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more
intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with,
the Person specified.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect," when
used in connection with an entity, means a change, effect, event, occurrence,
state of facts or development that, individually or in the aggregate with
other such changes, effects, events, occurrences, states of facts or
developments, is or is reasonably expected to be both material and adverse
with respect to the financial condition, business, operations and results of
operations of such entity taken as a whole together with its Subsidiaries or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of such entity to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in no event shall any of the following, alone or in combination,

in determining whether there has been or will be, a Material Adverse Effect on
any entity: (i) any change or effect that is required pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, (ii) any change or effect that results from
changes affecting any of the industries in which such entity operates
generally or the United States or worldwide economy generally (which changes

respect); (iii) any natural disaster or any acts of terrorism, sabotage,
military action or war (whether or not declared) or any escalation or

projections; (v) any change or effect resulting from the announcement or

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

9.4 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Parent Disclosure Letter (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the

of the Company Indemnified Parties set forth in Section 5.8.

9.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

9.6  _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached.

9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of California, regardless of the
laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE COURTS OF CALIFORNIA AND TO
THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, ON

ANY PARTY TO SERVE LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW. 

9.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this
Section 9.10 shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to
