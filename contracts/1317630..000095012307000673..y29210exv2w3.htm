Independent Accounting Firm (including procedures for the presentation of evidence). If the
Parties are unable to agree upon procedures before the expiration of thirty (30)&nbsp;days after receipt
by Seller of the Adjustment Dispute Notice, the Independent Accounting Firm shall establish
procedures, which procedures may be, but need not be, those proposed by either Party. The Parties

resolution of such dispute shall be borne by the Parties in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received

only $40,000, Buyer shall bear 60% of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and
Seller shall bear the other 40% of such fees and expenses. The decision rendered by the
Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3.3 may be filed as a judgment in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Either Party may seek specific enforcement or take other necessary legal

(i)&nbsp;the numerator of which is the number of days from the date of the immediately preceding

Information of the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose Confidential
Information to the extent that such information is required to be disclosed by Law, in connection

efforts to assure that any Confidential Information so disclosed is protected from further

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Upon Buyer&#146;s request, Seller shall permit Buyer a reasonable opportunity to meet with the
Employees during Seller&#146;s and applicable Employee&#146;s normal business hours. At least twenty (20)
days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to Seller a list of Employees to whom Buyer or
one of its Affiliates intends to make offers of employment. With respect to any Employee to whom
Buyer makes an offer of employment at or prior to the Closing, Seller shall not make any offer of
enhanced compensation or benefits to induce or otherwise encourage such Employee to remain in the
Seller&#146;s employ after the Closing, but Seller shall inform such Employees of their expected status
if they elect to remain with Seller. Furthermore, Seller shall not transfer any Employee to, or
allow any Employee to bid for, a position with Seller or its Affiliates that would result in such
Employee providing a lower portion of such Employee&#146;s time providing services in respect of the
Purchased Transmission Assets. Buyer shall notify Seller in writing as to each Employee who has
accepted an offer of employment (which shall be limited to a maximum of fifty (50)) and each
Employee who has formally rejected an offer of employment made pursuant to this section, in each
instance, within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days following the receipt of such acceptance or rejection, but
in no event later than the Closing Date.
