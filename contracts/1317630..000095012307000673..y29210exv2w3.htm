 1.2 _Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters_. Unless otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply: 

  

 (a) _Calculation of Time Period_. When calculating the period of time before which, within which, or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period will be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question will end on the next succeeding Business Day. 

  

 (b) _Dollars_. Any reference in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" means U.S. dollars. 

  

 (c) _Exhibits and Schedules_. Unless otherwise expressly indicated, any reference in this Agreement to an "Exhibit" or a "Schedule" refers to an Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement. The Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part hereof as if set forth in full herein and are an integral part of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein are defined as set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _Gender and Number_. Any reference in this Agreement to gender includes all genders, and the meaning of defined terms applies to both the singular and the plural of those terms. 

  

 (e) _Headings_. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this Agreement into Articles, Sections, and other subdivisions, and the insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and do not affect, and will not be utilized in construing or interpreting, this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. 

  

 (f) " _Herein_ ". The words such as " _herein_ ," " _hereinafter_ ," " _hereof_ ," and " _hereunder_ " refer to this Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement) as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires. 

  

 (g) " _Including_ ". The word " _including_ " or any variation thereof means " _including, without limitation_ " and does not limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following it. 

  

 (h) " _To the extent_ ". The words " _to the extent_ " when used in reference to a liability or other matter, means that the liability or other matter referred to is included in part or excluded in part, with the portion included or excluded determined based on the portion of such liability or other matter exclusively related to the subject. For example, if 40 percent of a liability is attributable to the Purchased Assets, then a statement that Buyer will assume the liability "to the 

   ##### 

  

    

extent related to the operation of the Purchased Assets" means that Buyer will
assume 40 percent of the liability. As an additional example, if a
performance obligation attributable to the Purchased Assets is by its terms
to be performed prior to and following the Effective Time, a statement
that Buyer will assume the obligation "to the extent such obligation relates
to the period from and after the Effective Time" means that Buyer will assume
all liability for the performance from and after the Effective Time, and that
Seller would remain liable for any failure to perform such obligations prior
to the Effective Time. 

  

 1.3 _Joint Negotiation and Preparation of Agreement_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as jointly drafted by the Parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof favoring or disfavoring any Party will exist or arise by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

ARTICLE III 
 PURCHASE PRICE 

   

 3.1 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Purchased Assets will be an amount equal to $750,000,000.00 (the " _Initial Valuation_ "), as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2 (as so 

   ##### 

  

    

adjusted, the " _Base Price_ "), as further adjusted pursuant to Section 3.3
(as so adjusted, the " _Purchase Price_ "). 

  

 3.2 _Determination of Base Price._  

  

 (a) Not less than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Obligations as of the Closing Date prepared in good faith by Seller (the " _Estimated Balance Sheet_ ") (A) clearly indicating in reasonable detail the liabilities and obligations included thereon that Seller wishes to transfer to Buyer on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Assumed Balance Sheet Obligations_ ") and (B) containing Sellers good faith estimate of the Net Non-Rate Base Asset Value as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Net Non-Rate Base Asset Value_ ") and a statement (the " _Estimated Rate Base Statement_ ") setting forth the Estimated Rate Base Amount, the Estimated Capital Expenditure Amount, the Estimated Rate Base Reclassification Amount and the Estimated CWIP Amount, together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. The Estimated Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied. The Estimated Rate Base Statement shall be prepared in accordance with FERC 18 CFR, consistently applied. Seller will provide Buyer and Buyers independent accountant with all supporting work papers used by Seller in connection with such calculations at the time it delivers the Estimated Balance Sheet and the Estimated Rate Base Statement. In the event that, not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer notifies Seller of any errors contained in the Estimated Balance Sheet or the Estimated Rate Base Statement, Seller shall in good faith consider Buyers comments relating to such errors and make any amendments to the Estimated Balance Sheet or the Estimated Rate Base Statement as Seller, acting in good faith, deems necessary or appropriate. 

  

 (b) Non-Rate Base Adjustment. For purposes of calculating the Base Price: 

   

 (i) If the Estimated Net Non-Rate Base Asset Value is a positive number, then the Base Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation increased by such amount. 

   

 (ii) If the Estimated Net Non-Rate Base Asset Value is a negative number, then the Base Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation decreased by such amount. 

  

 (c) Rate Base Adjustment. For purposes of calculating the Base Price: 

   

 (i) If the Estimated Rate Base Amount is greater than the Projected Rate Base Amount, then the Base Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.2(b), increased by the sum of (A) an amount equal to the Estimated Rate Base Amount _minus_ the Projected Rate Base Amount _plus_ , if applicable, (B) the product of (x) any portion of such amount (but not to exceed $20 million) calculated in the preceding clause (A) to the extent attributable to a Rate Base Reclassification Increase  _multiplied_ by (y) the Net Premium Multiple. 

   

 (ii) If the Estimated Rate Base Amount is less than the Projected Rate Base Amount, then the Base Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation, as adjusted 

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant to the terms of Section 3.2(b), decreased by the product of (x) an
amount equal to the Projected Rate Base Amount _minus_ the Estimated Rate
Base Amount, _multiplied_ by (y) the Premium Multiple. 

   

 (iii) If the Estimated CWIP Amount is greater than the Projected CWIP Amount, then the Base Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.2(c)(i) or (ii), as the case may be, increased by an amount equal to the Estimated CWIP Amount _minus_ the Projected CWIP Amount. 

   

 (iv) If the Estimated CWIP Amount is less than the Projected CWIP Amount, then the Base Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.2(c)(i) or (ii), as the case may be, decreased by an amount equal to the Projected CWIP Amount _minus_ the Estimated CWIP Amount. 

  

 (d) The Base Price shall be an amount equal to the Initial Valuation as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.2(b) and 3.2(c). 

  

 3.3 _Determination of Purchase Price._  

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Post-Closing Adjustment Date, but in any event within ninety (90) days thereafter, Seller will prepare and deliver to Buyer a consolidated balance sheet of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Obligations as of the Closing Date (as finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.3, the " _Final Balance Sheet_ "), (A) clearly indicating in reasonable detail the liabilities and obligations included thereon that Seller transferred to Buyer on the Closing Date (as finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.3, the " _Actual Assumed Balance Sheet Obligations_ ") and (B) containing the Net Non-Rate Base Asset Value as of the Closing Date (as finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.3, the " _Actual Net Non-Rate Base Asset Value_ "), and a statement (as finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.3, the " _Final Rate Base Statement_ ") setting forth the Actual Rate Base Amount, the Post-Closing Rate Base Value, the Actual Capital Expenditure Amount, the Actual Rate Base Reclassification Amount and the Actual CWIP Amount, together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. Each of the Final Balance Sheet and the Final Rate Base Statement shall be reviewed by Deloitte and Touche LLP. The Final Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied. The Final Rate Base Statement shall be prepared in accordance with FERC 18 CFR, consistently applied. Seller shall provide Buyer and Buyers independent accountant with all supporting work papers and all books and records of Seller, and Buyer may make inquiry of the representatives of Sellers accountants and Seller, as requested by Buyer in connection with preparation and review of the Final Balance Sheet and the Final Rate Base Statement. Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in connection with Sellers preparation of the Final Balance Sheet and the Final Rate Base Statement and related information, and to provide Seller with access to its books, records, information and employees as Seller may reasonably request in connection with such preparation. The Final Balance Sheet and Final Rate Base Statement shall be prepared and adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.3 to avoid duplication of any items, and not to include any items, to the extent otherwise taken into account in the prorations under Section 3.5. 

  

 (b) The amounts set forth in the Final Balance Sheet and the Final Rate Base Statement will be final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes unless, and only to the extent, 

   ##### 

  

    

that within 60 days after Seller has delivered the Final Balance Sheet and
the Final Rate Base Statement, Buyer notifies Seller of any dispute with
matters set forth therein. Any such notice of dispute delivered by Buyer (an
" _Adjustment Dispute Notice_ ") will identify with reasonable specificity
each item in the Final Balance Sheet and the Final Rate Base Statement with
respect to which Buyer disagrees, the basis of such disagreement, and Buyers
position with respect to such disputed item. 

  

 (c) If Buyer delivers an Adjustment Dispute Notice in compliance with Section 3.3(b), then (i) the undisputed portion of the total proposed Adjustment Amount based on the Final Balance Sheet and the Final Rate Base Statement (together with interest thereon for the period commencing on the Closing Date through the date of payment calculated at the Prime Rate in effect on the Closing Date) will be paid by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, in accordance with the payment procedures set forth in Section 3.3(g); and (ii) Buyer and Seller will attempt to reconcile their differences and any written resolution agreed and executed by both of them as to any disputed amounts will be final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes on the Parties. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach a resolution with respect to all disputed items within 45 days of delivery of the Adjustment Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller will submit any items remaining in dispute for determination and resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm which will be instructed to determine and report to the Parties, within 30 days after such submission, upon such remaining disputed items. The report of the Independent Accounting Firm will be final, binding, and conclusive on the Parties for all purposes. The personnel of the Independent Accounting Firm performing such services shall be individuals who are independent of, and impartial with respect to Buyer and Seller and their Affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees, and the officers, directors, agents and employees of their respective Affiliates. Before referring a matter to the Independent Accounting Firm, the Parties shall agree on procedures to be followed by the Independent Accounting Firm (including procedures for the presentation of evidence). If the Parties are unable to agree upon procedures before the expiration of thirty (30) days after receipt by Seller of the Adjustment Dispute Notice, the Independent Accounting Firm shall establish procedures, which procedures may be, but need not be, those proposed by either Party. The Parties shall, as promptly as practicable, submit evidence to the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with such procedures. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm incurred in the resolution of such dispute shall be borne by the Parties in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by Seller on the one hand and Buyer on the other from the resolution of the dispute. For example, if Buyer challenges items underlying the calculation of the Adjustment Amount in the net amount of $100,000, but the Independent Accounting Firm determine that Buyer has a valid claim for only $40,000, Buyer shall bear 60% of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and Seller shall bear the other 40% of such fees and expenses. The decision rendered by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 3.3 may be filed as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either Party may seek specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any decision of the Independent Accounting Firm under this Section 3.3. 

  

 (d) Final Non-Rate Base Adjustment. For purposes of calculating the Purchase Price: 

   

 (i) If the Actual Net Non-Rate Base Asset Value is a positive number, then the Purchase Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation increased by such amount. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) If the Actual Net Non-Rate Base Asset Value is a negative number, then the Purchase Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation decreased by such amount. 

  

 (e) Final Rate Base Adjustment. For purposes of calculating the Purchase Price: 

   

 (i) If the Actual Rate Base Amount is greater than the Projected Rate Base Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3(d), increased by the sum of (A) an amount equal to the Actual Rate Base Amount _minus_ the Projected Rate Base Amount _plus_ , if applicable, (B) the product of (x) any portion of such amount (but not to exceed $20 million) calculated in the preceding clause (A) to the extent attributable to a Rate Base Reclassification Increase _multiplied_ by (y) the Net Premium Multiple. 

   

 (ii) If the Actual Rate Base Amount is less than the Projected Rate Base Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3(d), decreased by the product of (x) an amount equal to the Projected Rate Base Amount _minus_ the Actual Rate Base Amount, _multiplied_ by (y) the Premium Multiple. 

   

 (iii) If the Post-Closing Rate Base Value is greater than the Actual Rate Base Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3(e)(i) or (ii), as the case may be, increased by the product of (A) an amount equal to the Seller Post-Closing Capital Increase _multiplied_ by (B) the Net Premium Multiple. 

   

 (iv) If the Actual CWIP Amount is greater than the Projected CWIP Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3(e)(i), (ii) and/or (iii), as the case may be, increased by an amount equal to the Actual CWIP Amount _minus_ the Projected CWIP Amount. 

   

 (v) If the Actual CWIP Amount is less than the Projected CWIP Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be calculated as the Initial Valuation, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3(e)(i), (ii) and/or (iii), as the case may be, decreased by an amount equal to the Projected CWIP Amount _minus_ the Actual CWIP Amount. 

  

 (f) The Purchase Price shall be an amount equal to the Initial Valuation as adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3(d) and 3.3(e). 

  

 (g) Within five days following the final determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Article III, (i) if the Purchase Price is greater than the Base Price, Buyer will pay the Adjustment Amount to Seller; or (ii) if the Purchase Price is less than the Base Price, Seller will pay the Adjustment Amount to Buyer. Any amount paid under this Section 3.3(g) will be paid with interest for the period commencing on the Post-Closing Adjustment Date through the date of payment, calculated at the Prime Rate in effect on the Post-Closing Adjustment Date, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Party receiving payment. 

   ##### 

  

  

 3.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The sum of the Purchase Price and the Assumed Obligations will be allocated among the Purchased Assets on a basis consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within 60 days following the Closing Date, the Parties will work together in good faith to agree upon such allocation; provided that in the event that such agreement has not been reached within such 60-day period, the allocation will be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm, and such determination will be binding on the Parties. Each Party will pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with such determination. Each Party will report the transactions contemplated by the Agreement for federal Income Tax and all other Tax purposes in a manner consistent with such allocation to the extent consistent with applicable law. Each Party will provide the other promptly with any other information required to complete Form 8594 under the Code. Each Party will notify the other, and will provide the other with reasonably requested cooperation, in the event of an examination, audit, or other proceeding regarding the allocations provided for in this Section 3.4. 

  

 3.5 _Proration_. 

  

 (a) All Taxes (but not including Transfer Taxes), utility charges, and similar items customarily prorated, including those listed below, to the extent relating to the Purchased Assets will be prorated as of the Effective Time, with Seller liable to the extent such items relate to any period prior to the Effective Time, and Buyer liable to the extent such items relate to any period from and after the Effective Time. To the extent that Seller determines in good faith that amounts to be prorated under this Section 3.5 can be reasonably estimated at Closing, Seller will provide Buyer with such estimate and the Parties will adjust the amounts paid at Closing to reflect such prorations. Such items to be prorated will include: 

   

 (i) personal property Taxes, real property Taxes, replacement Taxes, assessments, franchise Taxes, and other similar charges, including charges for water, telephone, electricity, and other utilities; 

   

 (ii) any permit, license, registration, compliance assurance fees or other fees with respect to any Transferable Permits and Transferable Environmental Permits that are in fact transferred to Buyer, excluding any fees to transfer such Transferable Permits and Transferable Environmental Permits; 

   

 (iii) any pre-paid expenses (including security deposits) relating to the Purchased Assets; 

   

 (iv) rent, Taxes and other items (including prepaid services or goods not included in inventory) payable by or to Seller under any of the Purchased Agreements; 

   

 (v) fees or charges (other than Taxes) imposed by any Governmental Entity; and 

   

 (vi) rents under any leases of real or personal property. 

  

 (b) In connection with any real property or personal property Tax prorations, including installments of special assessments, replacement taxes payable by the owner of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Purchased Assets, or any other taxes assessed with respect to the Purchased
Assets on an annual or periodic basis, Buyer will be credited with an amount
equal to the amount of the current real property Tax or installment of
special assessments or other Tax, as the case may be, multiplied by a
fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of days from the date of
the immediately preceding installment to the day before the Closing Date, and
(ii) the denominator of which is the total number of days in the assessment
period in which the Closing Date occurs. In connection with any prorations,
in the event that actual amounts are not available at the Closing Date, the
proration will be based upon the Taxes, assessments, charges, fees, or rents
for the most recent period completed prior to the Closing Date for which
actual Taxes, assessments, charges, fees, or rents are available. All
prorations will be based upon the most recent available Tax rates,
assessments, and valuations. Any prorations will be made so as to avoid
duplication of any items, and will not include items to the extent otherwise
taken into account in determining the Purchase Price, including the
Adjustment Amount. 

  

 (c) The proration of all items under this Section 3.5 will be recalculated by Buyer within 60 days following the date upon which the actual amounts become available to Buyer. Buyer will notify Seller promptly of such recalculated amounts, and will provide Seller with all documentation relating to such recalculations, including tax statements and other notices from third parties. The Parties will make such payments to each other as are necessary to reconcile any estimated amounts prorated as of the Effective Time with the final amounts to be prorated. Seller and Buyer agree to furnish each other with such documents and other records as may be reasonably requested in order to confirm all proration calculations made pursuant to this Section 3.5.

 COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES 

   

 7.1 _Conduct of Business_.

 7.2 _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller will, during ordinary business hours and upon reasonable notice, (i) give Buyer and Buyers Representatives reasonable access to the Purchased Assets to which Buyer is not denied access by Law and to which Seller has the right to grant access without the consent of any other Person (and in the case where consent of another Person is required, only on such terms and conditions as may be imposed by such other Person); (ii) permit Buyer to make such reasonable inspections thereof as Buyer may reasonably request; (iii) furnish Buyer with such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the Purchased Assets as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request; and (iv) furnish Buyer with a copy of each material report, schedule, or other document primarily relating to the Purchased Assets filed by Seller with, or received by Seller from, any Governmental Entity; provided, however, that (A) any such investigation will be 

   ##### 

  

    

conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of the Purchased Assets, (B) Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless
Seller from and against any Losses caused to Seller by any action of Buyer or
Buyers Representatives while present on any of the Purchased Assets or other
premises to which Buyer is granted access hereunder (including restoring any
such premises to the condition substantially equivalent to the condition such
premises were in prior to any such investigation), (C) Seller will not be
required to take any action which would constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client privilege, and (D) Seller need not supply Buyer with any information
which Seller is under a contractual or other legal obligation not to supply;
provided, however, if Seller relies upon clauses (C) or (D) as a basis for
withholding information from disclosure to Buyer, to the fullest extent
possible without causing a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, or a
violation of a contractual or legal obligation, as the case may be, Seller
will provide Buyer with a description of the information withheld and the
basis for withholding such information and will otherwise use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of such obligation and to the extent
such waiver is not obtained, take other commercially reasonable efforts to
otherwise provide such information or a summary thereof to Buyer.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.2 to the contrary, prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not have the right to perform or conduct any
environmental investigation, sampling or testing at, in, on, or underneath
any of the Purchased Assets, including, but not limited to, any visual
inspections and site visits commonly included in the scope of "Phase 1" level
environmental inspections. 

  

 (b) The Parties hereto will, and will cause their Affiliates and Representatives to, hold in strict confidence and not use or disclose to any other Person any Confidential Information. " _Confidential Information_ " means all information in any form heretofore or hereafter obtained from the other Parties in connection with each Partys evaluation of the Purchased Assets or the negotiation of this Agreement, whether pertaining to financial condition, results of operations, methods of operation or otherwise, other than information which is in the public domain, or becomes in the public domain after the date hereof, through no violation of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement. For purposes of this Section 7.2(b), from and after the Closing, Confidential Information regarding the Purchased Assets shall be considered Confidential Information of the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that such information is required to be disclosed by Law, in connection with any proceeding by or before a Governmental Entity, including any disclosure, financial or otherwise, required to comply with any SEC rules. In the event that any Party believes any such disclosure is required, such Party will give the other Parties notice thereof as promptly as possible and will cooperate with the other Parties in seeking any protective orders or other relief as the other Parties may determine to be necessary or desirable. In no event will any Party make or permit to be made any disclosure of Confidential Information other than to the extent such Partys legal counsel has advised in writing is required by Law, and such Party will use its best efforts to assure that any Confidential Information so disclosed is protected from further disclosure to the maximum extent permitted by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Parent will be permitted to disclose such information (i) to potential debt or equity financing sources, or to advisors in any equity offering or private placement of debt or equity securities, in connection with the Financing; provided that, such financing sources and advisors agree to be bound by a customary confidentiality agreement with Parent and Buyer and (ii) in any offering memorandum or prospectus or other disclosure documents (including periodic disclosure documents), in connection with Financing or otherwise, if, in the reasonable judgment of counsel 

   ##### 

  

    

to Buyer, such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable Law and
Seller has a reasonable opportunity to review any such disclosure. If the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, the Parties will
promptly return to the other Parties all copies of any Confidential
Information, including any materials prepared by such Party or its
Representatives incorporating or reflecting Confidential Information, and an
officer of each Party will certify in writing compliance by such Party with
the foregoing. 

  

 (c) The provisions of Section 7.2(b) supersede the Confidentiality Agreement, and will survive for a period of two years following the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, except that if the Closing occurs, the provisions of Section 7.2(b) will expire with respect to any information primarily related to the Purchased Assets. 

  

 (d) After the Closing, each Party and its representatives will have reasonable access to all of the books and records relating to the Purchased Assets in the possession of the other Party to the extent that such access may be reasonably required by such Party in connection with the Assumed Obligations or the Excluded Liabilities, or other matters relating to or affected by the operation of the Purchased Assets. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall have access to operational information and data necessary to operate, use and own the Purchased Assets in the manner operated, used or owned by Seller prior to Closing. Such access will be afforded by the Party in possession of such books and records upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours; provided, however, that (i) any review of books and records will be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of any Party or its Affiliates, (ii) no Party will be required to take any action which would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, and (iii) no Party need supply the other Party with any information which such Party is under a contractual or other legal obligation not to supply. The Party exercising the right of access hereunder will be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section 7.2(d). For a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, the Party in possession of such books and records agrees not to dispose of any such books and records unless, prior to such disposition, such Party gives the other Party a reasonable opportunity at such other Partys expense to segregate and take possession of such books and records as such other Party may select. 

  

 (e) Upon the request of Parent or Buyer for a period of five years after the Closing Date, (i) during ordinary business hours and upon reasonable notice, Seller shall provide to Buyer reasonable access to its books, records and employees for the purpose of Buyers or Parents preparation of periodic reports, filings or registrations required pursuant to applicable Law, including, without limitation, any rules promulgated by the New York Stock Exchange or the SEC, and preparation of audited or unaudited financial statements of Buyer, Parent or the Purchased Assets, historical and pro forma, which comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC for those periods which would be required to be included in a registration statement on Form S-1, or any other SEC form, for Buyer or Parent, filed with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; and (ii) upon reasonable notice, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its officers, employees, representatives, agents and advisors, to (A) execute such certifications and documents as are customary and required of acquired businesses, are reasonably requested by Buyer or Parent, and are necessary for Buyers or Parents compliance with applicable Law, including, without limitation, the rules and regulations promulgated by the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC, and (B) provide 

   ##### 

  

    

accountants "comfort letters" with respect to the Financial Information
and information derived therefrom and consents of accountants for use of
their reports in any materials reasonably requested by Buyer or Parent, to
the extent such letters and consents are necessary for Buyer or Parent to
comply with applicable Law, including, without limitation, the rules
and regulations promulgated by the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC;
provided that, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its officers,
directors and Affiliates from and against Losses suffered or incurred by any
of them with respect to any Claims made by third parties (including
any Governmental Entity) relating to or based upon public disclosure by or on
behalf of Buyer of any information of Seller pursuant to this Section
7.2(e)(including, without limitation, Claims based upon or pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended or any state securities laws), and any other cooperation provided
at Buyers request pursuant to this Section 7.2(e); provided further,
however, that Buyer shall not have any obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless Seller, its officers, directors or Affiliates to the extent that any
such Losses suffered or incurred arose from information provided by Seller
in writing to Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.2(e) failing to be true and
correct in all material respects. In the event of a change in applicable Law,
including, without limitation, the rules and regulations promulgated by the
New York Stock Exchange and the SEC, that results in information of the type
described in this Section 7.2(e) being required by Buyer or Parent for
compliance with such Law for periods after five years following the Closing
Date, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to furnish such
information in a manner reasonably consistent with the tenor of the foregoing
sections of this Section 7.2(e). Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all third-
party out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller in connection with
its cooperation under this Section 7.2(e). 

  

 7.3 _Expenses_. Except to the extent specifically provided herein, and irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be borne by the Party incurring such costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) filing fees under the HSR Act will be borne solely by Buyer; (ii) expenses associated directly with the customer impact analysis performed for Buyer in connection with State Regulatory Approvals shall be shared equally by the Parties, provided that the third party performing such analysis is reasonably acceptable to Seller; and (iii) any payments to third parties that are required for Seller to obtain consents and approvals, including with respect to the assignment of Purchased Agreements, pursuant to Section 7.4(d) shall be borne by Seller to the extent such payments are equal to or less than $400,000 and shared equally by the Parties to the extent such payments exceed $400,000, and then only to the extent of such excess; provided that, neither Party shall be obligated to bear any portion of such payments to the extent in excess of $2,900,000 in the aggregate. 

  

 7.4 _Further Assurances; Procedures with Respect to Certain Agreements and Other Assets_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain satisfaction of the conditions precedent to each Partys obligations hereunder within its reasonable control. Neither 

   ##### 

  

    

Party will, without the prior written consent of the other Party, take any
action which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede,
interfere with or delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Parties acknowledge that there may exist, as of the Closing, (i) assets or liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates which, by mistake or omission, have not been transferred to or assumed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) assets or liabilities formerly of Seller which, by mistake or omission, have been transferred to or assumed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (i) In the event that either Party (the " _Discovering Party_ ") discovers any such assets or liabilities following the Closing, it shall so notify, in writing (a " _Transfer Notice_ "), the other Party (the " _Notified Party_ ") that such assets or liabilities were, by mistake or omission, transferred to or assumed by, or not transferred to or assumed by, Buyer on the Closing. Following the delivery of any Transfer Notice, the Parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith either to effect any transfer or assumption of any such assets or liabilities or to cause Buyer or any successor or assign of Buyer and Seller to enter into another mutually agreeable arrangement, in each case as necessary and appropriate to correct such mistake or omission, including, without limitation, the payment or repayment of any amounts required to be paid in connection with such transfer, assumption or other arrangement pursuant to Section 7.4(b)(ii). Unless, on or before the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the Notified Partys receipt of a Transfer Notice, the Notified Party delivers a notice, in writing (a " _Transfer Objection Notice_ "), to the Discovering Party advising it that the Notified Party disagrees with the Transfer Notice, the Transfer Notice shall be deemed a binding agreement pursuant to which the Parties agree to cause to be transferred to or assumed by Buyer or any successor or assign of Buyer or Seller or one of its Affiliates, as appropriate, the assets or liabilities identified in the Transfer Notice, or to cause Buyer or any successor or assign of Buyer and Seller to enter into such other arrangement as may be specified in the Transfer Notice. If the Notified Party delivers a timely Transfer Objection Notice, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine whether the assets or liabilities identified in the Transfer Notice should be transferred or assumed as specified therein or to cause Buyer or any successor or assign of Buyer and Seller to enter into another mutually agreeable arrangement as necessary to give full effect to the transactions contemplated herein. All conveyances discussed in this paragraph shall be subject to any required approvals from Governmental Entities and all applicable provisions of the Distribution Interconnect Agreement. Each Party agrees to use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents or approvals from any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transfers contemplated by this Section 7.4(b). 

   

 (ii) In the event that pursuant to this Section 7.4(b): (A) Buyer transfers any assets to Seller and such assets were not included in the calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Article III of this Agreement, no payment by Seller shall be required with respect to such transfer, (B) Buyer transfers any assets to Seller, and such assets were included in the calculation of Purchase Price pursuant to Article III of this Agreement, Seller shall pay to Buyer the product of (x) the Net Book Value of such assets _multiplied_ by (y) the Premium Multiple; provided that, if Buyer has not delivered to Seller a 

   ##### 

  

    

Transfer Notice with respect to such transfer on or prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer the Net Book Value
of such assets, (C) Seller transfers assets to Buyer, and such assets were
not included in the calculation of Purchase Price pursuant to Article III of
this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to Seller the Net Book Value of such assets,
or (D) Seller transfers assets to Buyer, and such assets were included in
the calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Article III of this
Agreement, no payment by Buyer shall be required with respect to such
transfer. 

  

 (c) Seller has Transmission Easements, some of which relate solely to the Purchased Assets, and others of which relate to the Purchased Assets and Sellers other businesses as set forth in  _Schedule 7.4(c)_ (the " _Shared Easements_ "). At the Closing, Seller will assign to Buyer, subject to the obtaining of any necessary consents, (i) by the Assignment of Easements, all Transmission Easements which relate solely to the Purchased Assets, and (ii) by the Partial Assignment of Shared Easement or other document, sufficient rights under the Shared Easements to permit Buyer to use the same, as presently used by Seller with respect to the Purchased Assets, on a non-exclusive basis (the " _Shared Easement Rights_ "). 

  

 (d) Seller shall have primary responsibility for obtaining, and will use its reasonable best efforts (without being required, except as set forth in Section 7.3, to make any payment to any third party or to incur any economic burden) to obtain, all consents required pursuant to the terms of any Purchased Agreement, Transferable Permit, Transferable Environmental Permit, Transmission Easement or Shared Easement as promptly as possible after the date hereof. Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in its efforts to obtain any such consent (including the submission of such financial or other information concerning Buyer and the execution of any assumption agreements or similar documents reasonably requested by a third party). Without limiting the other covenants in this Section 7.4(d), to the extent any Purchased Agreement does not solely relate to Transmission or the Purchased Assets, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, with Buyers reasonable cooperation, to partially assign such Purchased Agreement to Buyer to the extent related to Transmission or the Purchased Assets, or to enter into a separate agreement with the applicable counterparty that can be assigned to Buyer, on substantially identical terms as the applicable Purchased Agreement, relating to Transmission or the Purchased Assets; _provided_ that, if such efforts are unsuccessful to assign to Buyer only that portion of the Purchased Agreement that relates to Transmission or the Purchased Assets, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to subcontract or sublease to Buyer that portion of such Purchased Agreement as relates to Transmission or the Purchased Assets. To the extent that Sellers rights under any Purchased Agreement, Transferable Permit, Transferable Environmental Permit, Transmission Easement or Shared Easement may not be assigned or transferred without the consent of another Person which consent has not been obtained prior to Closing, this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or be unlawful. Seller and Buyer agree that if, following Sellers use of its reasonable best efforts as required in the first sentence of this Section 7.4(d), any consent to an assignment of any Purchased Agreement, Transferable Permit, Transferable Environmental Permit, Transmission Easement or Shared Easement is not obtained prior to Closing or any attempted assignment would be ineffective or would impair Buyers rights and obligations under the Purchased Agreement, Transferable Permit, Transferable Environmental Permit, Transmission Easement or Shared Easement in question so that Buyer would not acquire the benefit of all such rights and obligations, (i) Seller may elect to exercise its 

   ##### 

  

    

rights under Section 7.4(e) with respect to any such Purchased Agreement that
is a personal property lease, or (ii) if Seller does not, or, is unable to,
exercise such rights, then at the Closing the Parties will, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law and such Purchased Agreement, Transferable Permit,
Transferable Environmental Permit, Transmission Easement or Shared Easement
enter into such arrangements with each other as are reasonably necessary
to provide Buyer with the benefits and obligations of such Purchased
Agreement, Transferable Permit, Transferable Environmental Permit,
Transmission Easement or Shared Easement from and after the Closing; provided
that, no such actions will be deemed to have caused the closing conditions
set forth in Section 9.2(b) to have been satisfied unless after giving effect
thereto the Buyer would, without being in breach of applicable Law or the
applicable Contracts, be able to operate, own or use the Purchased Assets in
all material respects in the manner operated, used or owned by
Seller immediately prior to the Closing. In the event that at the Closing
Seller has been unable to transfer or assign to Buyer any Purchased
Agreement, Transferred Permit, Transferred Environmental Permit, Transmission
Easement or Shared Easement Rights in respect of a Shared
Easement, notwithstanding any other arrangements established pursuant to this
Section 7.4(d) in respect thereof, at Buyers request Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts (without being required, except as set forth in
Section 7.3, to make any payment to any third party or to incur any
economic burden) to assign such Purchased Agreement, Transferred Permit,
Transferred Environmental Permit, Transmission Easement or Shared Easement to
Buyer as soon as practicable after Closing, including continuing to use
reasonable best efforts (without being required, except as set forth in
Section 7.3, to make any payment to any third party or to incur any economic
burden) to obtain any required consents as contemplated in this Section
7.4(d). Buyer agrees to provide Seller with reasonable advance notice (to the
extent practicable) in connection with any expenditure made pursuant to
this Section 7.4(d) that exceeds $25,000. 

  

 (e) With respect to any assets used primarily in connection with the Purchased Assets that are leased by Seller pursuant to a personal property lease that is a Purchased Agreement that cannot be assigned to Buyer, and the conditions contained in Section 9.2 are satisfied on the Closing or Buyer waives compliance with such conditions, Seller may elect prior to the Effective Time to purchase some or all of such assets leased under such lease, and such assets will be included in the Purchased Assets, if such purchase can be accomplished on a commercially reasonable basis. 

  

 (f) Following the Closing, each Party will promptly remit to the other any payments such Party receives that are in satisfaction of any rights or assets belonging to the other Party. 

  

 (g) The Parties agree that the methodology and principles used to classify a facility, asset or equipment as "transmission" or "distribution" (including, without limitation, as set forth in the definition of Transmission) under this Agreement, shall continue to be applied for any new facility, asset or equipment owned by Buyer in its service territory immediately after the Closing Date or Seller in its service territory immediately prior to the Closing Date, unless and until the Parties mutually agree to a new classification methodology and principles. In the event that after the Closing, Seller or any of its Affiliates owns any "transmission" asset in such service territory or Buyer or any of its Affiliates owns any "distribution" asset in such service territory through (i) future system modifications resulting in the reclassification of any facilities, assets or equipment of any such Person or (ii) an acquisition of any facilities, assets or equipment by any such Person, Seller or its relevant Affiliates shall convey to Buyer ownership of such "transmission" 

   ##### 

  

    

asset or Buyer shall convey to Seller ownership of such "distribution" asset,
as the case may be. The price to be paid for any facilities, assets or
equipment so conveyed shall be priced equal to the Net Book Value of such
facilities, asset or equipment, but in any case shall not be less than zero
dollars (i.e., no payment from a seller to a buyer will occur as a result
of the Net Book Value being less than zero). All conveyances discussed in
this paragraph shall be subject to any required approvals from Governmental
Entities and all applicable provisions of the Distribution Interconnect
Agreement. Each Party agrees to use reasonable best efforts to obtain any
consents or approvals from any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Section 7.4(g). For purposes of this
Section 7.4(g), the "service territory" as it relates to Sellers obligations
shall mean the geographic territory in which, immediately prior to the
Closing, Seller conducts the business directly related to the Purchased
Assets. For purposes of this Section 7.4(g), the "service territory" as it
relates to Buyers obligations shall mean the geographic territory in which,
immediately following the Closing, Buyer conducts the business directly
related to the Purchased Assets. 

  

 (h) If at any time all of the Required Regulatory Approvals other than the approval of the Missouri Public Service Commission have been obtained such that the conditions set forth in Sections 9.2(e) and 9.3(d) would be satisfied, the parties shall endeavor to mutually agree upon amendments to this Agreement to provide that (i) the approval of the Missouri Public Service Commission is not a condition to Closing, (ii) the Purchased Assets and Assumed Obligations located in Missouri or subject to regulation by the Missouri Public Service Commission (collectively, the " _Missouri Assets_ ") would not be required to be transferred and assumed at the Closing, and the Purchase Price adjusted accordingly, (iii) Seller shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts following the Closing Date to obtain the requisite consents and approvals required to transfer the Missouri Assets to Buyer, and (iv) to the extent that all required regulatory approvals for the transfer of the Missouri Assets are received by Seller and other customary closing conditions with respect to such assets and liabilities are satisfied or waived by the date 24 months after the Closing Date, Seller will sell, assign, convey, transfer and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase and acquire, the Missouri Assets, with the applicable purchase price calculated on a basis consistent with the calculation of Purchase Price hereunder. 

  

 7.5 _Public Statements_. Each Party will consult with the other prior to issuing, and will consider in good faith any comments by the other to or in respect of, any public announcement, statement, or other disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except as may be required by Law or stock exchange rules and provided that any such public announcement, statement, or other disclosure issued by any Party will be subject to Section 7.2(b). 

  

 7.6 _Consents and Approvals_. 

  

 (a) Seller and Buyer will each file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties will consult and cooperate with each other as to the appropriate time of filing such notifications and will (i) make such filings at the agreed upon time, (ii) respond promptly to any requests for additional information made by either of such agencies, and (iii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the 

   ##### 

  

    

waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest
possible date after the date of such filings. Buyer shall bear its own costs
and expenses for the preparation of any such filings, including, without
limitation, the expense of the applicable filing fees. 

  

 (b) Seller and Buyer will cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly prepare and file, on a joint basis where feasible and applicable, all necessary applications, notices, petitions, and filings, and execute all agreements and documents to the extent required by Law or Order for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Required Regulatory Approvals), (ii) obtain the transfer to Buyer of all Transferable Permits and Transferable Environmental Permits, and the reissuance to Buyer of all Transferable Permits and Transferable Environmental Permits that were not transferred on the Closing, (iii) obtain the consents, approvals, and authorizations of all Governmental Entities to the extent required by Law or Order for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Required Regulatory Approvals), and (iv) obtain all consents, approvals, and authorizations of all other Persons to the extent necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required by the terms of any license, franchise, permit, concession or Contract to which Seller or Buyer is a party or by which either of them is bound. Seller and Buyer each will have the right to review in advance all characterizations of the information relating to it or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which appear in any filing made by the other in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer shall have primary responsibility for the preparation and filing of the FERC Transaction Approvals, FERC 204 Approval and FERC 205 Approval and Seller shall have primary responsibility for the preparation and filing of the State Transaction Approvals. Buyer agrees that it shall not seek approval for the recovery of any acquisition premium as part of any of the Required Regulatory Approvals and that the denial by a Governmental Entity of the opportunity for the recovery of any acquisition premium shall not constitute a Material Adverse Effect; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller will elect to treat the transaction as a taxable asset sale. As a result of this election, Buyer will increase its basis in the assets for tax purposes, and Seller is recognizing a taxable gain on the assets. The tax basis and book basis are expected to be equal after the election is made, which would result in no recognition of deferred taxes on the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) Neither Party will on an _ex parte_ basis initiate, directly or indirectly, any communications, meetings, or other contacts with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters relating to any declaration, filing, or registration with, notice to, or authorization, consent, or approval of any such Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement. In connection with any communications, meetings, or other contacts, formal or informal, oral or written, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or any such declaration, filing, registration, notice, authorization, consent, or approval, each Party agrees: (i) to inform the other in advance of any such communication, meeting, or other contact which such Party proposes or intends to make, including the subject matter, contents, intended agenda, and other aspects of any of the foregoing; (ii) to consult and cooperate with the other Party, and to take into account the comments of such other Party in connection with any of the matters covered by Section 7.6(c)(i); (iii) to arrange for representatives of the other Party to participate to the maximum extent possible in any such communications, meetings, or other contacts; (iv) to notify the other Party of any oral communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing; and 

   ##### 

  

    

(v) to provide the other Party with copies of all written communications with
any Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.6(c) will apply to or restrict
communications or other actions by Seller with or with regard to Governmental
Entities in connection with the Purchased Assets in the ordinary course of
business or communications or other actions by Buyer with or with regard to
Governmental Entities in connection with Buyers operations that are not
related to the Purchased Assets. 

  

 (d) Seller and Buyer will cooperate with each other and promptly prepare and file notifications with, and request Tax clearances from, state and local taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which a portion of the Purchase Price may be required to be withheld or in which Buyer would otherwise be liable for any Tax liabilities of Seller pursuant to such state and local Tax Law (other than any such liabilities which under the terms hereof are to be paid by Buyer). 

  

 (e) Without limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller further agrees to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to support all Buyer Required Regulatory Approvals, through advocacy before regulatory or judicial bodies, and in other forums, as applicable, including without limitation through participation in evidentiary hearings and other proceedings and the filing of pleadings, briefs, comments and testimony with regulatory or judicial bodies, and in other forums, as applicable, and not to oppose or challenge, directly or indirectly, the positions taken by Buyer under any Buyer Required Regulatory Approval, provided that such positions taken by Buyer are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (f) Without limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, Buyer further agrees to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to support all Seller Required Regulatory Approvals, through advocacy before regulatory or judicial bodies, and in other forums, as applicable, including without limitation through participation in evidentiary hearings and other proceedings and the filing of pleadings, briefs, comments and testimony with regulatory or judicial bodies, and in other forums, as applicable, and not to oppose or challenge, directly or indirectly, the positions taken by Seller under any Seller Required Regulatory Approval, provided that such positions taken by Seller are consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 7.7 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be borne by Seller to the extent such payments are equal to or less than the amounts paid by Buyer for filing fees under the HSR Act, and shared equally by the Parties to the extent such Transfer Taxes exceed the amounts paid by Buyer for filing fees under the HSR Act. Seller will file, to the extent required by applicable Law, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and if required by applicable Law, Buyer will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation. 

  

 (b) Seller will be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of all Tax Returns reflecting Taxes payable by Seller and the timely payment of all Taxes shown to be due on such returns. Buyer will be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of all Tax Returns reflecting Taxes payable by Buyer and the timely payment of all Taxes shown to be due on such 

   ##### 

  

    

returns. Any Tax Return that reflects Taxes to be prorated in accordance with
Section 3.5 will be subject to the approval of the Party not preparing such
return, to the extent related to such prorated Taxes, which approval will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each Party will make any such Tax Return
prepared by it available for the other Partys review and approval no
later than 20 Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return.
Within 15 Business Days after receipt of such Tax Return, the approving Party
will pay to the Party preparing the Tax Return the amount of such prorated
Taxes shown as due on such approved Tax Return for which such approving Party
is responsible under Section 3.5. 

  

 (c) Buyer and Seller will provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the other Party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any taxing authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes, and each Party will retain and provide the other with any records or information which may be relevant to such return, audit or examination or proceedings. Any information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.7(c) or pursuant to any other Section hereof providing for the sharing of information in connection with the preparation of, or the review of, any Tax Return or other schedule relating to Taxes will be kept confidential by the Parties hereto in accordance with Section 7.2(b). 

  

 7.8 _Supplements to Schedules_. Not later than 30 days prior to the Closing Date, Seller may supplement or amend by written notice to Buyer any or all of the following sections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule: (i) Schedules 1.1-(D) through (M), 2.1(b), 2.1(d), 2.1(k), and (ii) Schedules 5.7(b), 5.8(a), 5.9(a)-2, 5.10(a), 5.12(a), 5.14(a), and 7.4(c); provided that, without limitation to Buyers rights under Section 7.2, contemporaneously with any supplement or amendment pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 7.8, Seller shall provide to Buyer all material underlying documentation relating to each item included in such supplement or amendment. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any updates by Seller to Schedules 1.1-E, 1.1-G, 1.1-I, 1.1-K, 1.1-M, 4.3(j) and 4.4(g) will be made pursuant to the principles established in _Schedule 7.8_. 

  

 7.9 _Eminent Domain; Casualty Loss_. 

  

 (a) If, before the Closing Date, any of the Purchased Assets are taken by eminent domain or condemnation, or are the subject of a pending or (to Sellers Knowledge) contemplated taking which has not been consummated, Seller will (i) notify Buyer promptly in writing of such fact and (ii) at the Closing assign to Buyer all of Sellers right, title, and interest in and to any proceeds or payments received, or to be received, in compensation for such taking. 

  

 (b) If, before the Closing Date, all or any material portion of the Purchased Assets are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, Seller will notify Buyer promptly in writing of such fact and, at the Closing assign all of Sellers right, title, and interest in and to any insurance recoveries received, or to be received, in compensation for such damage or destruction less any such amounts received, or to be received, to reimburse Seller for expenditures incurred by Seller. 

  

 (c) To the extent permitted under applicable law, Seller and its Affiliates, at Buyers cost and expense, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the exercise of eminent domain and/or condemnation rights, upon reasonable request of Buyer, on behalf of Buyer or any successor or assign of Buyer (subject to Section 12.4) who acquires substantially all of the 

   ##### 

  

    

business conducted with the Purchased Assets, in order to enable Buyer or any
such successor or assign of Buyer to expand or modify the Purchased Assets,
until such date on which Buyer (or any such successor or assign of Buyer
(subject to Section 12.4)) is authorized by applicable law to acquire the
right of condemnation, eminent domain or any similar right which can be
exercised on behalf of public utilities. 

  

 7.10 _Transitional Use of Signage and Other Materials Incorporating Seller s Name or other Logos_. Buyer acknowledges that it will have no ongoing claim or rights in or to the Seller Marks. Buyer will not use or permit the use of any Seller Marks, and Buyer shall (a) within 60 days following the Closing Date, remove or cause the removal of the Seller Marks from all emergency phone number signage at each Substation Facility, and (b) within one year following the Closing Date, remove or cause the removal of all signage or other items utilizing Seller Marks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller agrees to not allege that Buyer has violated Sellers intellectual property rights solely as a result of Buyer retaining Sellers Marks on signage or other items prior to removal in accordance with this Section 7.10. 

  

 7.11 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as either Party is actively contesting or defending against any third-party Claim in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date related to the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities, the other Party will cooperate with the contesting or defending Party and its counsel in the contest or defense, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records as is reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article X hereof). 

  

 7.12 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments (provided for clarification that Buyer has no obligation under this Agreement to undertake any underwritten or publicly-marketed offering of debt or equity instruments or securities). In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitments, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources on terms at least as favorable to Buyer (as determined in the sole discretion of Buyer) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Buyer shall give the Seller prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Financing Commitments, or any termination, modification or amendment of the Financing Commitments. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing, (i) Seller shall (A) as reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the Financing, provide the Financial Information to Buyer; and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to provide information regarding or relating to the Purchased Assets reasonably requested by Buyer to assist Buyer with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, road show materials and similar documents that may be used in connection with the Financing; and (ii) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, employees, 

   ##### 

  

    

representatives, agents and advisors, including legal and accounting
advisors, to (A) provide accountants "comfort letters" with respect to the
Financial Information and information derived therefrom and consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the
Financing, to the extent such letters and consents are customary in
connection with such Financings; (B) provide applicable and customary legal
opinions of internal and outside counsel, to the extent such opinions
are customary in connection with such Financings; (C) execute such
certifications and documents as are customary for acquired businesses, are
reasonably requested by Parent, and are customary in connection with such
Financings and/or necessary to allow Buyer to comply with applicable
Law, including, without limitation, the rules and regulations promulgated by
the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC; and (D) reasonably cooperate with
Buyer on other matters in connection with the Financing in a manner
reasonably consistent with the tenor of the foregoing sections of
this Section 7.12; provided that nothing in this Section 7.12 shall require
such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of Seller. Seller hereby consents to the use of
Sellers logo on rating agency presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, road show
materials and similar documents that may be used in connection with
the Financing, subject to the prior written approval of its use (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Buyer shall reimburse
Seller for all third-party out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Seller in connection with its cooperation under this Section 7.12(b),
other than costs and expenses incurred in connection with preparing the
Financial Information. 

  

 (c) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its officers, directors and affiliates from and against Losses suffered or incurred by any of them with respect to any Claims made by third parties (including any Governmental Entity) relating to or based upon public disclosure by or on behalf of Buyer of any information provided by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 7.12(b) (including, without limitation, Claims based upon or pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any state securities laws), and any other cooperation provided at Buyers request pursuant to Section 7.12(b); provided further, however, that Buyer shall not have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its officers, directors or affiliates to the extent that any such Losses suffered or incurred arose from information provided by Seller in writing to Buyer pursuant to Section 7.12(b) failing to be true and correct in all material respects. 

  

 7.13 _Post-Closing Operations_. 

  

 (a) Immediately following the Effective Time, Buyer shall establish and maintain a corporate office in Iowa. 

  

 (b) For a period of 5 years after the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, Buyer shall not intentionally and voluntarily remove the Purchased Assets from the functional supervision and control of MISO. 

  

 7.14 _Affiliate Relationships_. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, all Contracts between the Seller on the one hand, and any Affiliate of the Seller on the other hand, relating to the Purchased Assets shall be terminated on the Closing, and all liabilities thereunder shall thereupon be discharged and released by Seller without any liability or cost to Buyer or its 

   ##### 

  

    

Affiliates, except that the agreements listed on _Schedule 7.14_ shall remain
in full force and effect. 

  

 7.15 _Financial Statements._ As soon as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event no later than June 30, 2007, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flow for the Purchased Assets, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied and in compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, and audited by Deloitte and Touche LLP or any other independent auditor reasonably acceptable to Buyer (the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "). Thereafter Seller shall deliver to Buyer, as soon as practicable after it becomes available, the remainder of the Financial Information (it being understood that those portions of the Financial Information described in clauses (iii) and (iv) of the definition thereof shall be provided to Buyer not later than 45 calendar days after the end of the applicable quarterly period). 

  

 7.16 _Non-Opposition_. After Buyers rates, rate construct, rate elements, terms and conditions of service are initially set in the FERC 205 Approval (" _Buyer s Initial Rates_"), and for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Seller shall not (and shall cause its parent and any wholly owned Affiliates of its parent not to), oppose, contest, challenge or file any complaint before FERC regarding, or takes any position with any third Person adverse to, Buyers Initial Rates. This prohibition does not apply to the extent that Buyer seeks changes to the Buyers Initial Rates in a manner adverse to Seller. For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Seller also shall not (and shall cause its parent and any wholly owned Affiliates of its parent not to) publicly oppose, contest or challenge, with any third Person, the plan of the Buyer, set forth in the applications for the Buyer Required Regulatory Approvals made pursuant to Section 7.6(b), for anticipated capital expenditures, except that this prohibition does not apply to the extent that Buyer departs from such plan. Nothing in this Section 7.16 prohibits Seller from opposing, contesting, or challenging the withdrawal of the Purchased Assets from participation in MISO. 

  

 7.17 _Title Insurance_. At Buyers option and at Buyers sole cost and expense, Buyer may obtain policies, dated the Closing Date, on ALTA 1992 Owners Form B with extended coverage guaranteeing the standard exceptions to title customarily contained in such policies, covering the Transmission Fee Interests and the Material Easements issued by a nationally recognized title insurance company (the " _Title Company_ "), insuring, as of the Closing Date, the fee simple title of Buyer in such Transmission Fee Interests or easement estate of Buyer in the Material Easements in an amount reasonably determined by Buyer, subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances. Seller shall cooperate reasonably and in good faith in Buyers efforts to obtain such policies of title insurance, including executing and delivering, or causing to be executed and delivered, to the Title Company any affidavits reasonably requested by the Title Company or Buyer in connection with the issuance of the policies and to provide affirmative endorsements for no mechanics liens; provided that to the extent Buyer requests Seller to provide such cooperation and/or execute and deliver such affidavits, and without limiting any rights Buyer has under this Agreement, including Article X, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its officers, directors and Affiliates from and against Losses suffered or incurred by any of them with respect to any Claims made by third parties relating to or based upon any affidavit of Seller provided at Buyers request pursuant to this Section 7.17; provided, however, that Buyer shall 

   ##### 

  

    

not have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its officers,
directors or Affiliates to the extent that any such Losses suffered or
incurred arose from information provided by Seller in writing in
any affidavit pursuant to this Section 7.17 failing to be true and correct in
all material respects. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be
obligated to furnish any title insurance policies to Buyer and it shall not
be a requirement of or condition to the Closing that Buyer obtain or be
able to obtain any such policies. Prior to the Closing Date, at the request
of Buyer, Seller shall provide to Buyer abstracts of title with respect to
the Transmission Fee Interests, to the extent available. 

  

 7.18 _Insurance_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts following the Closing (a) with respect to any "occurrence" based third party insurance policies of Seller, to recover under such policies for losses arising from events occurring prior to the Closing and relating primarily to the Purchased Assets, and (b) with respect to any "claims made" third party insurance policies of Seller, to recover under such policies for losses from events occurring prior to the Closing and relating primarily to the Purchased Assets to the extent Seller shall have received written notice of claims relating to such events on or before the Closing Date; provided that (i) in no event shall Seller be obligated hereunder to commence legal action against any insurer to obtain such recovery, and (ii) such commercially reasonable efforts shall not require Seller to incur any Loss with respect to any deductibles, self-insured retentions, retained amounts, retentions or exclusions. With respect to all insurance proceeds actually received by Seller pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above, Seller agrees to (x) apply such proceeds to satisfy the associated liability, and (y) remit to Buyer such proceeds to the extent not applied by Seller to satisfy the associated liability. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 EMPLOYEE MATTERS 

   

 8.1 _Offers of Employment; Transferred Employees_. 

  

 (a) Upon Buyers request, Seller shall permit Buyer a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Employees during Sellers and applicable Employees normal business hours. At least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to Seller a list of Employees to whom Buyer or one of its Affiliates intends to make offers of employment. With respect to any Employee to whom Buyer makes an offer of employment at or prior to the Closing, Seller shall not make any offer of enhanced compensation or benefits to induce or otherwise encourage such Employee to remain in the Sellers employ after the Closing, but Seller shall inform such Employees of their expected status if they elect to remain with Seller. Furthermore, Seller shall not transfer any Employee to, or allow any Employee to bid for, a position with Seller or its Affiliates that would result in such Employee providing a lower portion of such Employees time providing services in respect of the Purchased Transmission Assets. Buyer shall notify Seller in writing as to each Employee who has accepted an offer of employment (which shall be limited to a maximum of fifty (50)) and each Employee who has formally rejected an offer of employment made pursuant to this section, in each instance, within ten (10) Business Days following the receipt of such acceptance or rejection, but in no event later than the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each Employee who accepts an offer of employment from Buyer or its Affiliates, and who continues to be an employee of Seller until immediately prior to the Closing, shall become employed by Buyer (a " _Transferred Employee_ ") either (i) as of the Closing Date or (ii)  in the event any such Employee is on leave as approved by Seller in the ordinary course of business as of the Closing Date (not including any absence of short duration such as vacation, bereavement leave or jury duty, but including short or long-term disability, military leave, or maternity/paternity leave), such Employee shall become a Transferred Employee as of the date that such Employee is no longer on any approved leave and reports to work for Buyer so long as the Employee reports to work with Buyer or its Affiliates within five (5) Business Days after the end of the leave. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Employee who is on approved leave on the Closing Date may report to work for Buyer later than 180 days after the Closing Date (other than any Employee who is on military leave or other leave subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or comparable state Law). To the extent permitted by applicable Law, a list of Employees on approved leave as described above, the date such approved leave is expected to end (if available) and the reason for such approved leave is provided on  _Schedule 8.1(b)_, such list to be updated by Seller as of the Closing. 

  

 (c) For a period of 30 months from the Closing Date, Seller agrees that it will not solicit (i) any Transferred Employees or (ii) any Employee who accepts employment with Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing (but is not otherwise a Transferred Employee), or hire any such person in (i) or (ii) at an aggregate compensation (including deferred compensation) rate in excess of that being paid to such person by Buyer. 

  

 (d) Prior to the Closing Date and for a period of 30 months from the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that it will not solicit any employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates for any position with Buyer or any of its Affiliates other than for positions primarily related to the Purchased Transmission Assets. 

  

 8.2 _Treatment of Transferred Employees_. 

  

 (a) For a period of 30 months from and after the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide each Transferred Employee with base salary and incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity based compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by Seller and its Affiliates to the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) Each Transferred Employee shall be eligible for a potential bonus payment from Seller under Sellers annual incentive plan in which each such employee participates as of the date hereof (the " _Bonus Plan_ ") regardless of the fact that the employee is not employed by Seller at the end of such year or on the applicable payment date. The applicable annual bonus amount shall first be determined based on the actual company performance for the year, indicating either no bonus entitlement or a bonus equal to, less than or greater than target for each such Transferred Employee. Any individual performance criteria for the Bonus Plan shall be deemed to be satisfied at the target level. In the event that an annual bonus would be earned, Seller shall pay a fraction of such bonus, the numerator of which shall be the number of days elapsed during such calendar year prior to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be 365. Any such bonus shall be payable on the date bonuses are generally paid under the Bonus 

   ##### 

  

    

Plan, but in no event later than the March 15 following the end of the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs. Effective as of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall provide each such Transferred Employee with the opportunity to
earn a bonus in respect of the balance of the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs that is comparable to the bonus that a similarly situated
employee of Buyer is eligible to earn in respect of such balance of the
calendar year pursuant to Buyers annual incentive plan. 

  

 (c) Seller shall, in addition to paying the bonus as provided in Section 8.2(b) above, pay to each Transferred Employee the annual bonus each such employee actually earned under the Bonus Plan in respect of the calendar year completed immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Prior Year Bonuses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Transferred Employees shall be entitled to receive their Prior Year Bonuses without regard to any requirement that may exist under the Bonus Plan that such employees be employed by Seller on the date the Prior Year Bonuses are otherwise payable in order to receive such bonuses. Seller shall pay the Prior Year Bonuses to the Transferred Employees on the Closing Date (or, if later, within 2.5 months of the end of the calendar year completed immediately prior to the Closing Date), in accordance with past practice and at such time as Prior Year Bonuses are otherwise payable to the employees of Seller. 

  

 (d) With respect to each Seller Plan that is a non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement or equity or equity-based arrangements, Seller shall, immediately prior to the applicable hire date, vest each Transferred Employee fully in such Transferred Employees account balances and other benefits. Any such benefits shall be distributed pursuant to the terms of said Seller Plan as in effect from time to time. 

  

 (e) Within 60 days after a Transferred Employee commences employment with Buyer or its Affiliates, Buyer will cause such Transferred Employee to receive a grant of restricted shares of common stock of ITC Holdings Corp. (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") on the terms and conditions set forth in ITC Holdings Corp.s 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan or 2003 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for key employees and related forms of Restricted Stock Award Agreement, with the number of such shares determined for each Transferred Employee by Buyer and with a vesting schedule not less favorable to the Transferred Employees than a 5-year cliff schedule. Buyer shall notify Seller of each such grant and, within 30 days after delivery of each such notice, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to 65% of the fair market value of the Restricted Shares, as determined by reference to the closing bid price for publicly traded shares of common stock of ITC Holdings Corp. on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Seller pay to Buyer an amount in excess of $2,600,000 under this Section 8.2(e). 

  

 8.3 _Services Provided by Represented Employees; Leased Employees_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, certain services have been provided to Seller related to the Purchased Assets by employees who are represented by a collective bargaining representative (hereinafter, the " _Represented Employee Work_ "). Subject to applicable law, for a period of 36 months from the Closing Date, Buyer shall engage Seller, and Seller shall provide to Buyer, the Represented Employee Work at cost. For this purpose, "cost" means fully-loaded costs without any profit factor, including, where applicable but not by way of limitation, all payroll-related overheads, payroll taxes, stores loadings, transportation loadings, facility and supplies, and an 

   ##### 

  

    

AandG overhead to cover the costs associated with processing and billings,
consistent with past practice. 

  

 (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall enter into an employee lease agreement pursuant to which Seller will make available, at cost (as described in 8.3(a) above) and for a period of up to 36 months, a number of Employees who do not become Transferred Employees as is necessary for Buyer to operate the Purchased Assets in a manner comparable to Sellers operation during the period prior to the Closing. 

  

 (c) Effective as of the Closing Date and for a period of up to 30 months, if requested by Seller, Buyer shall make available to Seller the services of the Transferred Employees so indicated on _Schedule 5.18(e)_ who are deemed by Seller to be critical to other operations of Seller or its Affiliates. Such services shall be provided at cost (as described in 8.3(a) above). In no event shall the percentage of time devoted to Seller for any such employee exceed 40% of full time. 

  

 8.4 _WARN_. Buyer shall be responsible for any obligation with respect to the Transferred Employees under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (and the regulations promulgated thereunder) and any applicable or similar state or local equivalent (collectively, " _WARN_ ") arising on or after the Closing Date except to the extent no such liability would have arisen in the absence of any terminations of employment by Seller. Seller shall be responsible for any such obligation arising prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 8.5 _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) For a period of 30 months from and after the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide Transferred Employees with the opportunity to participate in the welfare benefit plans and employee pension benefit plans, both as defined in Section 3 of ERISA, maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (" _Buyer Plans_ "), on substantially the same terms and conditions on which similarly situated employees of Buyer participate in such plans. Transferred Employees shall receive credit under Buyer Plans toward eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual (other than for benefit accrual for any defined benefit pension plan) for prior service with Seller or its Affiliates, except to the extent such credit would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service (for the avoidance of doubt, any Transferred Employee who is or becomes entitled to receive retiree medical benefits from Seller under Sellers retiree medical plan, as in existence on the date of this Agreement, shall not be eligible to receive any similar benefits under Buyers retiree medical plan). 

  

 (b) Effective as of the applicable date on which an Employee becomes a Transferred Employee (as applicable, the " _hire date_ "), Buyer or its Affiliates shall cause their respective group health plans to, subject to their respective terms, (x) cover such Transferred Employee and dependents of such Transferred Employee who are covered under a Seller Plan that is a group health plan as of the Closing Date and to be responsible (in accordance with the Buyer Plans) for expenses incurred in regards to such welfare plans for such Transferred Employee and dependents on or after the hire date; (y) credit deductible payments and co-insurance payments made in the calendar year of the hire date by such Transferred Employee and dependents under Sellers group health plans for expenses incurred on or prior to the hire date toward deductibles 

   ##### 

  

    

in effect for its group health plans for the calendar year of the hire date;
and (z) waive all eligibility waiting periods for such Transferred Employee
and dependents for any employee benefit plans maintained by Buyer as of the
hire date. 

  

 (c) Seller shall be responsible for providing continuation coverage, as is required pursuant to COBRA in respect of any Employee or "qualified beneficiary" (as defined in COBRA) who incurs a "qualifying event," except with respect to Employees who become a Transferred Employee in accordance with Section 8.1. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for providing such continuation coverage in respect of any Transferred Employee or qualified beneficiary of a Transferred Employee whether the qualifying event occurs before or after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall provide COBRA continuation coverage for a period not to exceed three months for all Transferred Employees, with such coverage to be paid for by Buyer. 

  

 (d) With respect to any unused accrued vacation carried over from a prior calendar year, Seller shall directly pay it or cause it to be paid to the Transferred Employees on or as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date. Vacation used in the calendar year of the Closing Date shall be first applied against carried over entitlement and only thereafter to the entitlement earned for that calendar year. 

  

 (e) The obligation for vacation earned for the calendar year of the Closing Date shall be split between Seller and Buyer. Any net liability shall be paid in cash to Seller or Buyer, as applicable, on or as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date. The Seller portion is the fraction of the annual vacation benefit, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year preceding the Closing Date and the denominator of which is 365. The Buyer portion is the fraction of the annual vacation benefit, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year on and after the Closing Date and denominator of which is 365. Seller shall be credited with any vacation actually paid during the calendar year prior to the Closing Date to the extent that it relates to vacation earned for the calendar year, not vacation carried over from a preceding year. Buyer shall, on and after the Closing Date, allow each Transferred Employee who has vacation accrued with respect to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, but unused as of the Closing Date, to use such vacation during the balance of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs in accordance with Buyers vacation policy; in the event that a Transferred Employee does not use all of his or her accrued but unused vacation as provided in the foregoing clause, on the last day of the applicable calendar year, Buyer shall pay each such Transferred Employee an amount equal to such remaining accrued but unused vacation days. 

  

 8.6 _Seller s Defined Benefit Pension Plan_. Transferred Employees shall be treated as terminated as of the Closing Date with respect to Sellers Defined Benefit Pension Plan, except that Seller shall fully vest all Transferred Employees in their accrued benefits thereunder as of the Closing Date. 

  

 8.7 _Retiree Health_. Transferred Employees who would, but for their termination of service with the Seller on the Closing Date, be eligible to retire on or at any time prior to the Closing Date and receive benefits under the Sellers retiree medical plan shall be treated as having so retired on the Closing Date solely for the purposes of eligibility for future retiree 

   ##### 

  

    

medical benefits under Sellers retiree medical plan. Transferred Employees
who would not be eligible to retire prior to the Closing Date and receive
benefits under the Sellers retire medical plan, shall be treated as
terminated as of the Closing Date under the Sellers retiree medical plan.
Within 120 days of the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller its calculation
of "accumulated postretirement benefit obligation" under its retiree medical
plan in respect of any Transferred Employee who was an Employee of Seller or
its Affiliates at any time after reaching age 45 but who was not yet eligible
to receive benefits under Sellers retiree medical plan upon retirement (such
amount, the " _Transferred Employee APBO_ ") provided that such
calculation shall give effect to any service credit provided to such
Transferred Employees for employment with Seller after attainment of age 45.
Within 30 days of delivery of the calculations, Sellers applicable Code
Section 501(c)(9) trust shall pay to Buyers applicable Code Section
501(c)(9) trust an amount in cash equal to the Transferred Employee APBO. 

  

 8.8 _Tax-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan_. Buyer agrees to cause its tax-qualified defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") to accept a direct rollover to the Buyer 401(k) Plan of any Transferred Employees account balances under any Seller 401(k) plan and/or cash balance pension plan if such rollover is elected in accordance with applicable Law by such Transferred Employee.

ARTICLE X 
 INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 10.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Notices of Claims_. The representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing and will expire fifteen months after the Closing Date, except that (i) the representations and warranties in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3(a), 5.16, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3(a), and 6.6 will survive indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties in Sections 5.7, 5.9 and 5.17 will survive the Closing and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of this Agreement, and (iii) the representations and warranties in Sections 5.15 and 5.18 will survive the Closing and will expire upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; provided that, any representation or warranty (and the indemnification obligations of the Parties with respect thereto) that would otherwise terminate in accordance with this Section 10.1 will continue to survive if notice for indemnification shall have been timely given under this Article X on or prior to such termination date, until the related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this Article X. 

  

 10.2 _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 10.1 (with respect to clause (ii)) and Section 10.4 (with respect to clauses (i), (ii), (iv), (v) and (vi)) hereof, from and after the Closing, Seller will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all Claims and Losses (each, an " _Indemnifiable Loss_ "), asserted against or suffered by Buyer relating to, resulting from, or arising out of: 

   

 (i) any breach by Seller of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement which by its terms is to be performed prior to or at the Closing; 

   

 (ii) any breach by Seller of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) any breach by Seller of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement not covered by Section 10.2(a)(i); 

   

 (iv) the Assumed Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities; 

   

 (v) the Assumed Pre-Closing Litigation; 

   

 (vi) the Pre-Closing Non-Balance Sheet Liabilities; or 

   

 (vii) the Excluded Liabilities. 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, for purposes of
this Article X only, all Material Adverse Effect and materiality
qualifications contained in Sellers representations and warranties in
Sections 5.3, 5.5(b), 5.7(a), 5.8(b), 5.9(a)-(e), 5.10(b), 5.11, 5.13, 5.15,
5.17 and 5.18(d) shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether
such representations and warranties have been breached; provided that, in any
event for purposes of calculating Losses payable by Seller pursuant to a
Claim by Buyer under this Article X, all Material Adverse Effect and
materiality qualifications contained in each of Sellers representations and
warranties shall be disregarded. 

   

 (b) Subject to Section 10.1 (with respect to clause (ii)), Section 10.2(a) (with respect to clauses (iv) and (v)) and Section 10.4 (with respect to clauses (i) and (ii)) hereof, from and after the Closing, Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses asserted against or suffered by Seller relating to, resulting from, or arising out of (i) any breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement which by its terms is to be performed prior to the Closing, (ii) any breach by Buyer of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (iii) any breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement not covered by Section 10.2(b)(i), (iv) the Assumed Obligations, or (v) any and all liabilities and obligations associated with the ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets from and after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, for purposes of this Article X only, all Material Adverse Effect and materiality qualifications contained in Buyers representations and warranties in Sections 6.3 and 6.5 shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether such representations and warranties have been breached; provided that, in any event for purposes of calculating Losses payable by Buyer pursuant to a Claim by Seller under this Article X, all Material Adverse Effect and materiality qualifications contained in each of Buyers representations and warranties shall be disregarded. 

  

 (c) Seller shall not be obligated to satisfy any particular indemnification claim by Buyer until with respect to that claim Buyer has first (i) used its commercially reasonable efforts to recover all Losses from Buyers insurers under applicable insurance policies so as to reduce the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss hereunder (and not taking any action specifically excluding from any of its insurance policies any Indemnifiable Losses if Losses of such type are otherwise covered by such policies) and (ii) used reasonable best efforts to recover such Losses through appropriate rate recovery, provided that such efforts shall only require seeking rate recovery to the extent that, in Buyers reasonable judgment acting in good faith, rate recovery of such Loss is prudent and consistent with applicable rate recovery rules and ordinary and proper 

   ##### 

  

    

accounting practices. The amount of any Indemnifiable Loss will be reduced to
the extent that Buyer actually receives any insurance proceeds or recovery
through rates with respect to an Indemnifiable Loss; provided, that the
amount of any such reduction shall be calculated to take into account the time
value of money for actual recovery received by Buyer after the date the Loss
is incurred. Buyer shall not be under any obligation pursuant to this
Agreement to maintain any, or any specific policies of, third party insurance
coverage. Buyer shall not have Indemnifiable Loss in respect of any
indemnifiable matter to the extent, but only to the extent, that such Losses
were included in the calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Article
III. 

  

 10.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) If a Party seeking indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnitee_ ") receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any Claim by any Person who is neither a Party to this Agreement nor an Affiliate of a Party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") for which the Indemnitee claims a right to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnitee will promptly give written notice of such Third Party Claim (" _Notice of Third Party Claim_ ") to the Party from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "). Such Notice of Third Party Claim will describe the nature of the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and will indicate the estimated amount, to the extent practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that the Indemnitee claims it has sustained or may sustain as a result of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and expense, will have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim while reserving its right to contest the issue of whether it is liable to the Indemnitee for any indemnification hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim. 

  

 (b) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 10.3(a), the Indemnifying Party will appoint counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee for the defense of such Third Party Claim, will diligently pursue such defense, and will keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed with respect to such defense. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, including permitting reasonable access to books, records, and personnel, in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim (provided, that any out-of-pocket third-party costs incurred by the Indemnitee in providing such cooperation shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnitee will have the right to participate in such defense, including appointing separate counsel, but the costs of such participation shall be borne solely by the Indemnitee; provided that such cost shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party in the event that the Indemnitee has determined in reasonable good faith that there is an actual or potential legal conflict between the position of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand relating to the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will have full authority, in consultation with the Indemnitee, to make all decisions and determine all actions to be taken with respect to the defense and settlement of the Third Party Claim, including the right to pay, compromise, settle, or otherwise dispose of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense; provided, that any such settlement will be subject to the prior consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that such consent shall not be required if (i) the consent or settlement contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third party asserting the claim to all Indemnitees affected by the claim, (ii) requires only the payment of a monetary amount by the Indemnifying Party, (iii) the consent or settlement does not contain any sanction 

   ##### 

  

    

or restriction upon the operation of any business by the Indemnitee and (iv)
the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing that it is liable to the
Indemnitee for an indemnification payment in respect of the full amount
payable pursuant to such settlement. If a firm offer is made to settle a
Third Party Claim, which the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and which
acceptance requires the consent of the Indemnitee pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party will give written notice to the
Indemnitee to that effect. In no event will the Indemnifying Party have
authority to agree to any relief binding on the Indemnitee other than the
payment of money damages by the Indemnifying Party unless agreed to by the
Indemnitee. 

  

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms hereof within 10 days after the applicable Notice of Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee may elect to defend against the Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable expenses of such defense to the extent the Indemnifying Party is otherwise obligated hereunder to indemnify Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim, subject in the case of Buyer as the Indemnitee to Buyers obligations pursuant to Section 10.2(c). 

  

 (d) Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Loss_ ") will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof, stating the nature of such Loss in reasonable detail and indicating the estimated amount, if practicable (" _Notice of Direct Loss_ "). The Indemnifying Party will have a period of 20 Business Days within which to respond to such Notice of Direct Loss. If the Indemnifying Party rejects such claim, or does not respond within such period, the Indemnitee may seek enforcement of its rights to indemnification under this Agreement, subject in the case of Buyer as the Indemnitee to Buyers obligations pursuant to Section 10.2(c). Any failure by the Indemnifying Party to respond under this Section 10.3(d) will not constitute an admission by the Indemnifying Party with respect to the claim asserted. 

  

 (e) If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement, or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery (including rate recovery), settlement, or payment by or against any other Person, the amount of such reduction, less any costs, expenses, or premiums incurred in connection therewith, will promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. Upon making any indemnity payment, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee against any third party in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the indemnity payment relates; provided, however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party is then in compliance with its obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss and (ii) until the Indemnitee recovers full payment of its Indemnifiable Loss, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such third party on account of said indemnity payment will be subordinated to the Indemnitees rights against such third party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation and subordination rights, and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims at the direction of the Indemnifying Party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) A failure to give timely notice as provided in this Section 10.3 will affect the rights or obligations of a Party hereunder only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, the Party entitled to receive such notice was actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim for indemnification made after expiration of the applicable time periods set forth in Sections 10.1 or 10.4 will be valid. 

  

 10.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) A Party may assert a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article X only to the extent the Indemnitee gives a Notice of Third Party Claim or Notice of Direct Loss, as applicable, with respect to such claim, to the Indemnifying Party (i) for claims pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(ii) or Section 10.2(b)(ii), prior to the expiration of the applicable time period set forth in Section 10.1; (ii) for claims pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) or Section 10.2(b)(i), within fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date; (iii) for claims pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(iv), within five years following the Closing Date; and (iv) for claims pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(v) or Section 10.2(a)(vi), within three years following the Closing Date. Any claim for indemnification by Buyer with respect to which a Notice of Third Party Claim or Notice of Direct Loss is received by Seller within the applicable time frame set forth in the foregoing sentence shall be deemed timely made regardless of whether Buyer has at such point begun to comply with its obligations pursuant to Section 10.2(c). Any claim for indemnification not made in accordance with Section 10.3 and the foregoing sentence by a Party on or prior to the applicable date set forth in Section 10.1 or this Section 10.4(a), and the other Partys indemnification obligations with respect thereto, will be irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X: (i) Seller will not have any indemnification obligations for Indemnifiable Losses under Sections 10.2(a)(i), 10.2(a)(ii), 10.2(a)(iv), 10.2(a)(v), and 10.2(a)(vi) (A) for any individual item where the Loss relating thereto is less than $100,000 and (B) in respect of each individual item where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than $100,000, unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $5,000,000, and then only to the extent of such excess; and (ii) in no event will the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Seller under Sections 10.2(a)(i), 10.2(a)(ii), 10.2(a)(iv), 10.2(a)(v), and 10.2(a)(vi) exceed 25% of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the limitations set forth in Sections 10.4(b)(i) and 10.4(b)(ii) will not apply to claims asserted by Buyer for breaches of Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3(a), 5.7, 5.15, 5.16, and 5.17, (y) the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Seller under Section 10.2(a)(ii) with respect to breaches of Sections 5.7 and 5.17, will not exceed 50% of the Purchase Price, less any other indemnification payments made by Seller pursuant to Sections 10.2(a)(i) and 10.2(a)(ii), and (z) the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Seller under Section 10.2(a)(ii) with respect to breaches of Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3(a), and 5.16, will not exceed 100% of the Purchase Price, less any other indemnification payments made by Seller pursuant to Sections 10.2(a)(i) and 10.2(a)(ii). 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X: (i) Buyer will not have any indemnification obligations for Indemnifiable Losses under Sections 10.2(b)(i) and 10.2(b)(ii) (A) for any individual item where the Loss relating thereto is less than $100,000 and (B) in respect of each individual item where the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than $100,000, unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $5,000,000, and then only to 

   ##### 

  

    

the extent of such excess; and (ii) in no event will the aggregate
indemnification to be paid by Buyer under Sections 10.2(b)(i) and 10.2(b)(ii)
exceed 25% of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the
limitations set forth in Sections 10.4(b)(i) and 10.4(b)(ii) will not apply to
claims asserted by Seller for breaches of Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3(a), and 6.6,
and (y) the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Buyer under Section
10.2(b)(ii) with respect to breaches of Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3(a), and 6.6
will not exceed 100% of the Purchase Price, less any other indemnification
payments made by Buyer pursuant to Sections 10.2(b)(i) and 10.2(b)(ii). 

  

 (d) No representation or warranty of either Party contained herein will be deemed untrue or incorrect, and such Party will not be deemed to have breached a representation, warranty, or covenant as a consequence of the existence of any fact, circumstance, action, or event that is permitted to be taken by such Party under the terms of this Agreement, or that is disclosed in this Agreement, any Schedule, or Exhibit hereto. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, neither Seller nor any other Person is making any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Seller, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Obligations or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Seller disclaims any other representations or warranties, whether made by Seller or its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, or representatives, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS. Any claims Buyer may have for breach of representation or warranty must be based solely on the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of Seller, any of its Affiliates or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or any other Person for, and Seller hereby disclaims all liability and responsibility for, any representation, warranty, projection, forecast, statement, or information made, communicated, or furnished (orally or in writing) to Buyer or any of Buyers Representatives, including any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf of Seller relating to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Obligations or other publications or data room information provided to Buyer or Buyers Representatives, or any other document or information in any form provided to Buyer or Buyers Representatives in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets, the assumption of the Assumed Obligations, and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any opinion, information, projection, or advice that may have been or may be provided to Buyer or Buyers Representatives by Seller or any of Sellers Representatives). BUYER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE V, THE PURCHASED ASSETS ARE BEING PURCHASED ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 10.4(e) shall limit in any respect any remedy to which any Party may be entitled in respect of any fraudulent breach of this Agreement or other fraud by the other Party. 

  

 10.5 _Applicability of Article X_. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller and Buyer agree that the remedies and obligations under this Article X apply only following the Closing, and that 

   ##### 

  

    

prior to the Closing or in the event that this Agreement is terminated the
Parties remedies will be determined by applicable Law and the provisions of
Article XI. 

  

 10.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article X as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, and local Income Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 

  

 10.7 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement (other than in this Section 10.7) or provided for under any applicable Law, no Party will, in any event, be liable to the other Party, either in contract or in tort, for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages of the other Party, including loss of future revenue, income, or profits, diminution of value, or loss of business reputation or opportunity, relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof or otherwise, whether or not the possibility of such damages has been disclosed to the other Party in advance or could have been reasonably foreseen by such other Party; provided, however, that the exclusion of consequential, incidental, indirect, special, and punitive damages as set forth above does not apply to any such damages sought by third parties against Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, in connection with Losses that may be indemnified pursuant to this Article X. In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, Seller will be liable for consequential Losses relating to any Claims and Losses of Buyer hereunder to the extent the event, occurrence, Claim or Loss underlying such indemnified matter negatively impacts the cash flow of Buyer; provided that, in no event shall Seller by liable for consequential Losses hereunder in excess of $20,000,000 in the aggregate (with such $20,000,000, to the extent incurred, deemed to be a part of and not in addition to the aggregate indemnification limits of Seller contained in this Article X). 

  

 10.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or inaccuracy, or alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or any covenant or agreement to be performed hereunder on or prior to the Closing Date, will be indemnification in accordance with this Article X and the remedies provided for in Section 11.4. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller and Buyer hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims, and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any tort or breach of contract claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have against the other arising under or based upon any Law (including any such Law under or relating to environmental matters), common law, or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 10.8 shall limit in any respect any remedy to which any Party may be entitled in respect of any fraudulent breach of this Agreement or any other fraud. 

  

ARTICLE XI 
 TERMINATION AND OTHER REMEDIES 

   

 11.1 _Termination_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer. 

  

 (b) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller or Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or before December 31, 2007 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided that, the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(b) will not be available to a Party if the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date resulted from such Partys willful or intentional breach of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) This Agreement may be terminated by either Seller or Buyer if (i) any Required Regulatory Approval has been denied by the applicable Governmental Entity and all appeals of such denial have been taken and have been unsuccessful, or (ii) one or more courts of competent jurisdiction in the United States or any State has issued an Order permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the Closing, and such Order has become final and nonappealable. 

  

 (d) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer if there has been a breach by Seller of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by it in this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Buyer to effect the Closing and such breach has not been cured by Seller or waived by Buyer within twenty (20) Business Days after all other conditions to Closing have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied, but only if Buyer is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. 

  

 (e) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if there has been a breach by Buyer of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by it in this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Seller to effect the Closing and such breach has not been cured by Buyer or waived by Seller within twenty (20) Business Days after all other conditions to Closing have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied, but only if Seller is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein; provided that such twenty (20) Business Day cure period shall not apply to Buyers obligation to pay the Base Price at Closing. 

  

 11.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either or both of the Parties pursuant to Section 11.1, written notice thereof will forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Party and this Agreement will terminate and the transactions contemplated hereby will be abandoned, without further action by either Party, whereupon the liabilities of the Parties hereunder will terminate, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including Section 11.3). 

  

 11.3 _Remedies upon Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein: 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Article XI, such termination will be the sole remedy of the Parties with respect to breaches of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement and neither Party nor any of its, directors, officers, or Affiliates, as the case may be, will have any liability or further obligation to the other Party or any of its, directors, officers, or Affiliates, as the case may be, pursuant to this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 11.3(a), the obligations of the Parties under Articles I, XI, and XII, and Sections 7.2(b), 7.3, 7.5 and 7.12(c) will survive termination of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Buyer will pay to Seller a fee equal to either (i) 3.25% of the Initial Valuation if Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(e) due to a breach by Buyer of its covenants and agreements hereunder (other than due to a breach by Buyer of its covenant to pay the Base Price at Closing), or of its representations and warranties hereunder made as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) 6.00% of the Initial Valuation if Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(e) due to a breach by Buyer of its covenant to pay the Base Price at Closing. In the event that Seller is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(e) due to a breach by Buyer of its covenant to pay the Base Price at Closing, then Sellers sole and exclusive remedy shall be the payment of liquidated damages contemplated by subparagraph (ii) above, and Seller shall not be entitled to seek or obtain an Order for specific performance or other equitable or injunctive relief to cause Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Seller will pay to Buyer a fee equal to 3.25% of the Initial Valuation if Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(d) due to a breach by Seller of its covenants and agreements hereunder, or of its representations and warranties hereunder (other than the representations and warranties contained in (i) Section 5.3(b), or (ii) insofar as such breach relates to Purchased Agreements, Easements and/or Permits, Section 5.3(d)) made as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (e) In view of the difficulty of determining the amount of damages which may result from a termination under the circumstances set forth in Section 11.1(d) or Section 11.1(e), and the failure of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer and Seller have mutually agreed that the payment set forth in Section 11.3(c) and Section 11.3(d) will be made to Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty. In the event of any such termination, the Parties have agreed that the payment set forth in Section 11.3(c) and Section 11.3(d) will be the sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be. ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT (i) THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THIS TRANSACTION TO BE CONSUMMATED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN, (ii) THE AMOUNT OF THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 11.3(c) AND SECTION 11.3(d) IS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND (iii) RECEIPT OF SUCH LIQUIDATED DAMAGES BY SELLER OR BUYER, AS THE CASE MAY BE, DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PENALTY. THE PARTIES HEREBY FOREVER WAIVE AND AGREE TO FOREGO TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHTS THEY HAVE OR IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE TO ASSERT ANY CLAIM DISPUTING OR OTHERWISE OBJECTING TO ANY OR ALL OF THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 11.3. Any payment under Sections 11.3(c) or Section 11.3(d) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account in the United States of America designated in writing by the Party entitled to receive such payment not later than three (3) Business Days following the date such Party delivers notice of such account designation to the Party responsible to make such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, in the absence of any termination of this Agreement, nothing 

   ##### 

  

    

contained in this Section 11.3 shall in any way limit the Parties rights
to indemnification under Article X of this Agreement or any other remedy the
Parties may have under this Agreement for breach of the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement. 

  

 (f) Upon any termination of this Agreement, all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, will be withdrawn from the Governmental Entity or other Person to which they were made. 

  

 11.4 _Specific Performance_. The Parties expressly agree that the Purchased Assets are unique, and in the event of breach of this Agreement by either Party, the other Party will, in addition to any of its rights or remedies hereunder, have the right to enforce this Agreement by obtaining an order for specific performance of the Parties obligations hereunder; provided that, in the event of a breach by Buyer of its covenant to pay the Base Price at Closing, Seller shall not be entitled to seek or obtain an Order for specific performance or other equitable or injunctive relief to cause Buyer to  consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If either Party resorts to legal proceedings to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such proceedings will be entitled to recover all costs reasonably incurred by such Party, including reasonable attorneys fees, in addition to any other relief to which such Party may be entitled under the terms hereof; provided, that in no event will either Party be entitled to receive any punitive, indirect, or consequential damages. 

  

ARTICLE XII

 12.1 _Amendment and Modification_. Except as provided in Section 7.8, this Agreement may be amended, modified, or supplemented only by written agreement of Seller and Buyer. 

  

 12.2 _Waiver of Compliance; Consents_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of either Party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition herein may be waived by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the Party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 

  

 12.3 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed given if delivered personally or by facsimile transmission, or mailed by overnight courier or certified mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid, to the Party being notified at such Partys address indicated below (or at such other address for a Party as is specified by like notice; provided that notices of a change of address will be effective only upon receipt thereof):

 12.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by either Party, without the prior written consent of the other Party, nor is this Agreement intended to confer upon any other Person except the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to any bank, financial institution or other lender providing financing to Buyer, as applicable, as collateral security for such financing; provided, however, that no such assignment shall (x) impair, impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (y) relieve or discharge Buyer from any of its obligations hereunder.

 12.6 _Severability_.

This Agreement, together with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the certificates and instruments delivered under or in accordance herewith, embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties hereto in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants, or undertakings in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than those expressly set forth or referred to herein or therein, and it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that there are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants, or undertakings contained in any other material made available to the Parties, including any such material made available in any data room, confidential information memoranda, management information presentations, or otherwise.
