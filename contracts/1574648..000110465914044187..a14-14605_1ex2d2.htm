Section 2.04 _Revenues and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, Sellers shall remain entitled to all of the rights of
ownership (including the right to all production, proceeds of production and
other proceeds) and shall remain responsible for all Operating Expenses, in
each case (a) attributable to the Assets for the

 



      
 

 



 

period of time prior to the Effective Time and (b) in accordance with their
respective interests in the Assets giving rise thereto. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to all of the rights of ownership (including
the right to all production, proceeds of production and other proceeds) and
shall be responsible for all Operating Expenses, in each case attributable to
the Assets for the period of time from and after the Effective Time. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all Operating Expenses
attributable to the Assets that are: (i) incurred with respect to operations
conducted or Hydrocarbons produced prior to the Effective Time shall be paid
by or allocated to Sellers in accordance with their respective interests in
the Assets giving rise thereto and (ii) incurred with respect to operations
conducted or Hydrocarbons produced from and after the Effective Time shall be
paid by or allocated to Buyer. For purposes of allocating production (and
accounts receivable with respect thereto) under this Section 2.04, (i) liquid
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Leases, Units
and Wells when they pass through the inlet flange of the pipeline connecting
into the storage facilities into which they are run or, if there are no such
storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meters or similar meters
at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they are transported
from the field and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the
delivery point sales meters on the pipelines through which they are
transported. Sellers shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to
arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging and
strapping data is not available. Sellers shall provide to Buyer evidence of
all meter readings and all gauging and strapping procedures conducted on or
about the Effective Time in connection with the Assets, together with all data
necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing
the adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.04.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
CONSIDERATION**

 



 

Section 3.01 _Purchase Price_. The total consideration for the purchase, sale
and assignment of the Assets by Sellers to Buyer is Buyers payment to Sellers
of the sum of $291,100,000 (the " **Purchase Price** ") as adjusted pursuant
to this Agreement (the " **Adjusted Purchase Price** "). The estimated
Adjusted Purchase Price (determined as provided in Section 9.02 and net of the
Deposit and any Escrow Defect Deposits) shall be paid by Buyer to Sellers at
the Closing by means of one or more completed wire transfers to the account(s)
designated by the Seller Representative on behalf of Sellers to Buyer in
writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing.

 



 

Section 3.02 _Deposit_.

 



 

(a) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer has
deposited by wire transfer with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("
**Escrow Agent** "), in same day funds the sum equal to five percent (5%) of
the Purchase Price (together with any interest and earnings thereon, the "
**Deposit** ") pursuant to that certain escrow agreement (the " **Escrow
Agreement** ") executed by the Seller Representative, Buyer and Escrow Agent
contemporaneously herewith. In the event the Closing occurs, the Deposit shall
be credited against the Purchase Price to be paid by Buyer at Closing and
retained in the escrow account established with Escrow Agent to satisfy (but
not

 



      
 

 



 

serve as a cap or other limitation of) amounts that may be owed by Sellers to
Buyer with respect to the indemnities of Sellers under this Agreement. Such
amount retained in the escrow account following the Closing, together with any
interest and earnings thereon, shall be referred to as the " **Indemnity
Escrow** ". Any interest included in the Indemnity Escrow shall be treated as
income of Buyer for federal income tax purposes.

 



 

(b) If (i) the Seller Representative terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.01(b) because of (A) the failure of Buyer to perform any of its
obligations hereunder in any material respect or (B) the failure of any of
Buyers representations or warranties hereunder to be true and correct to the
extent required pursuant to Section 8.01(a) as of the Closing, and (ii) (A) at
the time of such termination all conditions precedent to the obligations of
Buyer set forth in Section 8.02 have been met and (B) each Seller is ready,
willing and able to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
then, in such event, Sellers shall retain the Deposit, as liquidated damages
(and not as a penalty) and as Sellers sole remedy with respect thereto, in
which event Buyer and the Seller Representative shall jointly instruct Escrow
Agent to pay the Deposit to Sellers as directed by the Seller Representative.
It is expressly stipulated by the Parties that the actual amount of damages
resulting from such a termination would be difficult if not impossible to
determine accurately because of the unique nature of this Agreement, the
unique nature of the Assets, the uncertainties of applicable commodity markets
and differences of opinion with respect to such matters, and that the
liquidated damages provided for above are a reasonable estimate by the Parties
of such damages under the circumstances and do not constitute a penalty.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than as set forth in
Section 3.02(b), then Buyer shall be entitled to the delivery of the Deposit,
free of any claims by Sellers with respect thereto, and Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall jointly instruct Escrow Agent to pay the Deposit to
Buyer. Buyer and Sellers shall thereupon have the rights and obligations set
forth in Section 11.02.

 



 

Section 3.03 _Allocated Values_. Buyer and Sellers agree that the unadjusted
Purchase Price is allocated among the Assets in the amounts set forth in
Exhibit C. The " **Allocated Value** " for any Asset equals the portion of the
unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset on Exhibit C. To the extent
there is any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, such
adjustment shall adjust the Allocated Values set forth on Exhibit C
accordingly. Buyer and Sellers agree (x) that the Allocated Values, as
adjusted, shall be used by Sellers and Buyer as the basis for reporting Asset
values and other items for purposes of all federal, state and local tax
returns, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and (y) that neither
they nor their respective Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with
such Allocated Values in notices to Governmental Authorities, in audit or
other proceedings with respect to taxes, in notices to holders of preferential
purchase rights or in other documents or notices relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except to the extent otherwise required by Law;
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or any
Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental
Authority based upon or arising out of the allocation in this Section 3.03,
and neither Buyer nor any Seller shall be required to litigate before any
court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority
challenging such allocation. Each Party will notify the other

 



      
 

 



 

Parties if it receives notice that the Internal Revenue Service proposes any
allocation that is different from the allocation as set forth in Exhibit C.

 



 

Section 3.04 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) The Purchase Price for the Assets shall be adjusted as follows with all
such amounts being determined in accordance with GAAP and COPAS standards and
without duplication:

 



 

(i) Reduced by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds received by
Sellers: (A) proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons (net of any royalties,
overriding royalties or other burdens on or payable out of production,
gathering, processing and transportation costs and any production, severance,
sales or excise taxes or similar taxes) produced from or attributable to the
Assets during the during the period between the Effective Time and the Closing
Date (such period referred to herein as the " **Adjustment Period** "), and
(B) other proceeds earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment
Period;

 



 

(ii) Reduced in accordance with Section 4.10, by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of those Assets with respect to which the Preferential Rights
have been timely exercised by the Third Party holding such rights prior to
Closing;

 



 

(iii) (A) Reduced as a result of Title Defects by the Title Defect Amounts
therefor in accordance with Section 4.04(a), which such Title Defect Amounts
will be offset (and thereby reduced) by Title Benefit Amounts for Title
Benefits in accordance with Section 4.06(b), in each case, subject to the
limitations of Section 4.07; (B) reduced as a result of Environmental Defects
by the Environmental Defect Amounts therefor in accordance with Section
5.04(a), but subject to the limitations of Section 5.05; (C) reduced by the
amount of the Escrow Defect Deposits; and (D) reduced by the Allocated Values
of any Properties excluded from the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant
to Section 4.04(b), Section 4.05, Section 4.08(b), Section 4.10, Section
5.01(b), Section 5.04(b) or Section 5.06;

 



 

(iv) Reduced to the extent provided in Section 13.02 in connection with
Casualty/Condemnation Losses, if any;

 



 

(v) Reduced by any other amount expressly provided for in this Agreement or
agreed upon by Buyer and the Seller Representative;

 



 

(vi) To the extent not received by Sellers as of the Closing, increased by the
sale proceeds (net of any applicable royalties or other burdens) of all
Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to Sellers interest in the Assets
prior to the Effective Time that are in storage and not yet sold or upstream
of the sales metering point as of the Effective Time, it being understood that
Sellers shall retain such sale proceeds received prior to the Closing;

 



       
 

 



 

(vii) Subject to the limitations of Section 7.04, increased by the amount of
all Operating Expenses and other costs attributable to the ownership and
operation of the Assets which are paid by Sellers and incurred during the
Adjustment Period (including, for purposes of clarity, all Adjustment Period
drilling and completion capital expenditures and related capital expenditures
(in each case) pursuant to the AFEs set forth in Schedule 6.01(t), Schedule
7.04 or approved by Buyer pursuant to Section 7.04), except (A) any Operating
Expenses and other such costs already deducted in the determination of
proceeds of Sellers in Section 3.04(a)(i), (B) any costs incurred by Sellers
in connection with curing any Title Defect or Environmental Defect or with
respect to any Casualty/Condemnation Loss and (C) any costs incurred as a
result of any breach by any Sellers of this Agreement;

 



 

(viii) Increased by an overhead charge of $7,500 per month per well for wells
being drilled on the Assets and $750 per month per well for producing wells on
the Assets, in each case from the Effective Time to the Closing Date (prorated
as appropriate); and

 



 

(ix) Increased by any other amount expressly provided for in this Agreement or
agreed upon by Buyer and the Seller Representative on behalf of Sellers.

 



 

(b) Each adjustment made pursuant to Section 3.04(a)(i) shall serve to
satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Buyers entitlement under Section
2.04 to Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Assets during the
Adjustment Period, and to the value of other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period, and,
as such, Buyer shall not have any separate rights to receive any production or
income, proceeds, receipts and credits with respect to which an adjustment has
been made.

 



 

(c) Similarly, the adjustment described in Section 3.04(a)(vii) shall serve to
satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Buyers obligation under Section
2.04 to pay the costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the
Assets which are incurred during the Adjustment Period, and, as such, Buyer
shall not be separately obligated to pay for any such costs with respect to
which an adjustment has been made.

 



 

(d) In making the foregoing adjustments, ad valorem and similar taxes assessed
with respect to a period which begins before and ends after the Effective Time
shall be prorated based on the number of days in such period which fall on
each side of the Effective Time (with the day on which the Effective Time
falls being counted in the period after the Effective Time). Severance,
production or similar taxes that are based upon or measured by the production
of Hydrocarbons shall be apportioned between Sellers and the Buyer as if the
tax period ended immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the portion of
such taxes attributable to the period immediately prior to the Effective Time
being allocated to Sellers and the portion of such taxes attributable to the
period beginning on the Effective Time being allocated to the Buyer. If either
Party pays such taxes for which the other Party is responsible, and the amount
of such payment is not

 



      
 

 



 

taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price under this Section
3.04, then upon receipt of evidence of payment the nonpaying Party shall
reimburse the paying Party promptly for the nonpaying Partys share of such
taxes.

 



 

Section 3.05 _Withholding_. The Parties do not anticipate that any taxes will
be required to be withheld as part of the Agreement. However, Buyer shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to Sellers or any other Person such amounts as
Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any tax law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made. Should Buyer become aware of any such withholding
obligation, Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller Representative of such
obligation and the Parties shall cooperate in demonstrating that the
requirements for an exemption, if any, from such obligation have been
satisfied.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
TITLE MATTERS**

 



 

Section 4.01 _Title Examination Period_. Commencing on the date hereof and
ending May 9, 2014, at 6:00 p.m. Houston, Texas time (the " **Title
Examination Period** "), each Seller shall, subject to Section 7.01, (a)
permit Buyer and/or its representatives to examine, at reasonable times and in
the offices of Operator, all abstracts of title, title opinions, title files,
ownership maps, Lease files, assignments, division orders, operating records
and agreements (including the Contracts), environmental files (including all
such materials necessary to allow Buyer to ascertain whether Sellers and/or
Operator possess all required environmental permits in connection with the
Assets) and all other non-confidential and non-proprietary records and files
pertaining to the Assets insofar as same may now be in existence and in the
possession or control of such Seller or its Controlled Affiliates and (b)
subject to Third Party operator approval, permit Buyer and/or its
representatives, at reasonable times and at Buyers sole risk, cost and
expense, to conduct reasonable inspections of the Assets (other than
environmental inspections which are covered by Section 5.01).

 



 

Section 4.02 _Title Defects_. The term " **Title Defect** " shall mean any
matter (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) that would cause Sellers to
collectively have less than Defensible Title to one or more of the Assets;
provided, however, that no such matter shall be considered a Title Defect for
purposes of this Agreement unless the Title Defect Amounts attributable to
such matter as to all Sellers exceed a threshold of $50,000 (it being
understood that such amount shall be a threshold and not serve as a
deductible) (the " **Title Defect Threshold** "). The term " **Defensible
Title** " shall mean:

 



 

(a) with respect to any Well or PUD Location (each, a " **Property** ")
identified on Exhibit C (and as to the depths and formations identified on
Exhibit C with respect to each such Well and PUD Location), such title of
Sellers that:

 



 

(i) entitles Sellers to receive not less than the percentage set forth in
Exhibit C as Sellers net revenue interest for such Property (after
satisfaction of all royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests or
other similar burdens on

 



      
 

 



 

or measured by production of Hydrocarbons) of all Hydrocarbons produced, saved
and marketed from, or attributable to, such Property, all without reduction of
such interest throughout the duration of the productive life of such Property,
except (A) as specifically set forth in Exhibit C, (B) decreases in connection
with those operations in which a Seller may from and after the Execution Date
be a non-consenting co-owner, (C) decreases resulting from the establishment
or amendment of pools or units from and after the Execution Date, and (D)
decreases required to allow other working interest owners to make up past
underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries for Imbalances
set forth on Schedule 6.01(k) or arising from and after the Execution Date;

 



 

(ii) obligates Sellers to bear the percentage of the costs and expenses
relating to the maintenance, development and operation of such Property not
greater than the working interest for such Property shown in Exhibit C for
Sellers, without increase throughout the duration of the productive life of
such Property, except (A) as specifically set forth in Exhibit C, (B)
increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect to defaulting
co-owners under applicable operating agreements from and after the Execution
Date, and (C) increases to the extent that they are accompanied by a
proportionate increase in Sellers corresponding net revenue interest set
forth in Exhibit C; and

 



 

(iii) is free and clear of all Encumbrances, with the exception of Permitted
Encumbrances;

 



 

(b) with respect to all other Assets, such title that is good and defensible
and is free and clear of all liens, with the exception of Permitted
Encumbrances.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the loss of or reduction of interest in any
Asset following the Execution Date due to any election or decision made by a
Seller in accordance with applicable joint operating agreements as permitted
under this Agreement shall not constitute a Title Defect. As used herein, the
term " **PUD Location** " means the interest in Hydrocarbons that would be
produced from or attributable to a hypothetical well (or recompletion of a
Well) as identified on Exhibit C and located within the specific geographic
area set forth therein and with respect to the geological formation(s) set
forth therein.

 



 

Section 4.03 _Notice of Title Defects_. To assert a claim for a Title Defect,
Buyer must notify the Seller Representative thereof prior to the expiration of
the Title Examination Period. To be effective, such notice (a " **Title Defect
Notice** ") shall be in writing and shall include (a) a detailed description
of the alleged Title Defect(s), (b) the Assets affected thereby (each, a "
**Title Defect Property** "), (c) the value of each Title Defect Property
(which shall be the Allocated Value thereof), (d) the information upon which
the Title Defect(s) are based, (e) Buyers requirement(s) to cure such Title
Defect(s), and (f) the amount which Buyer reasonably believes to be the Title
Defect Amount resulting from the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations
and information upon which Buyers belief is based. Upon request, Buyer must
provide reasonable supporting documentation for any Title Defect. Subject to
Buyers rights with respect to any breach by a Seller of Section 7.03 and
Buyers rights under Section 4.09, any matters that may otherwise constitute
Title Defects (irrespective of the Title Defect Threshold)

 



      
 

 



 

but that are not specifically disclosed to Sellers pursuant to a Title Defect
Notice delivered to the Seller Representative prior to the expiration of the
Title Examination Period shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, for all purposes, (i) except
as may otherwise be a breach of the representations and warranties of a Seller
in Section 6.01, (ii) other than a Sellers special warranty of title provided
in the assignments delivered at Closing, and (iii) except for Buyers rights
in connection with Sellers indemnity obligations in Article XII, in each
case, which will not be affected or diminished by this waiver.

 



 

Section 4.04 _Remedies for Title Defects_. Upon timely delivery of a Title
Defect Notice, Buyer and the Seller Representative shall meet and use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the validity thereof and, if
valid, the Title Defect Amount thereof. Each Seller shall have the option, but
not the obligation, to attempt to cure any Title Defect, and Buyer agrees to
reasonably cooperate with the Seller Representative with respect to any
attempt by a Seller to cure any such Title Defect. If, prior to Closing, Buyer
and the Seller Representative have not agreed on the validity of one or more
Title Defects asserted in accordance with this Article IV or on the Title
Defect Amount thereof or, if applicable, the Seller Representative cannot cure
such Title Defect(s) to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer prior to Closing,
then the Seller Representative shall at its sole election for each such Title
Defect:

 



 

(a) subject to Section 4.07, cause the Purchase Price to be adjusted downward
by an amount (the " **Title Defect Amount** ") determined in accordance with
Section 4.08 for such Title Defect, which amount shall be deducted from
amounts payable by Buyer to Sellers at the Closing; or

 



 

(b) with respect to any Title Defect other than the Title Defect described on
Schedule 4.05(b) for which, in Buyers good faith judgment, the Title Defect
Amount exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the Allocated Value for the Title Defect
Property attributable to such Title Defect, cause Sellers to retain such Title
Defect Property and reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value (or portion thereof allocable thereto) of the Title Defect
Property, in which event, subject to Section 11.01(c), the Parties shall
proceed to the Closing and the Title Defect Property shall be retained by the
applicable Sellers as an Excluded Asset (and any other Title Defect Property
that Sellers elect to retain pursuant to Section 4.05(d) or 4.08(b)(i)(A)
shall also be Excluded Assets); or

 



 

(c) cause Sellers to attempt to cure such Title Defect in accordance with
Section 4.05. Sellers shall attempt to cure the Title Defect described on
Schedule 4.05(b).

 



 

Section 4.05 _Curative Provisions_. The following shall apply with respect to
each Title Defect that a Seller attempts to cure pursuant to Section 4.04(c)
(each, a " **Subject Defect** "):

 



 

(a) The Assets affected by each Subject Defect shall be conveyed to Buyer at
the Closing; an amount equal to the Title Defect Amount of each Subject Defect
(as asserted in good faith by Buyer, unless the Parties have otherwise agreed
upon an amount) shall be deducted from amounts otherwise payable at the
Closing; and at the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing, Buyer shall deposit such amount into an escrow account established
with Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement in a form
acceptable to Escrow Agent and reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Seller
Representative pending the curing or resolution of the applicable Subject
Defect.

 



 

(b) Such Seller shall have a ninety (90)-day period after the Closing within
which to attempt to cure the Subject Defects; provided, however, that, (i)
such Seller shall have one hundred and eighty (180) days following the Closing
Date to attempt to cure any Subject Defect with respect to the matter
described in Schedule 4.05(b) and (ii) if such Sellers curative efforts with
respect to a Subject Defect require the initiation of proceedings before a
Governmental Authority, the applicable cure period with respect thereto shall
be extended for so long as such proceedings are diligently pursued by such
Seller until such proceedings are concluded pursuant to a final, non-
appealable judgment or are otherwise finally resolved (the applicable cure
period being hereinafter referred to as the " **Cure Period** "). Buyer agrees
to cooperate at such Sellers cost and expense with the Seller Representative
in connection with such Sellers curative efforts, including in connection
with any proceedings before a Governmental Authority.

 



 

(c) In the event that a Seller believes in good faith that it has cured a
Subject Defect within the Cure Period, the Seller Representative shall submit
the applicable curative efforts to Buyer for approval (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld). Buyer shall be deemed to have approved such
curative efforts in the event Buyer does not notify the Seller Representative
of its objection to the same (and the reasons therefor) within ten (10) days
after Buyers receipt thereof. In the event Buyer so objects, such Seller
shall have an additional period of ten (10) days within which to perform
additional curative efforts to satisfy Buyers objections (and the Cure Period
applicable thereto shall be extended accordingly). In any event: (i) except
with respect to curative efforts that Buyer has been deemed to have approved,
each Party retains the right to dispute whether or not a Subject Defect has
been cured and whether or not a Subject Defect constitutes a Title Defect
and/or the Title Defect Amount with respect to such Subject Defect, and (ii)
any such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution
procedures set forth in Section 4.08(b)(ii) and Section 4.08(b)(iii), which
dispute resolution procedures must be initiated on or before ten (10) days
after the end of the Cure Period.

 



 

(d) Except for each Subject Defect that is submitted to arbitration pursuant
to Section 4.05(c) (in which event the amount deposited in escrow with respect
thereto, if any, shall remain in escrow pending resolution of the applicable
Subject Defect), with respect to each Subject Defect that has neither been
cured to Buyers reasonable satisfaction prior to the expiration of the Cure
Period or waived by Buyer: (i) if the remaining Title Defect Amount exceeds
50% of the Allocated Value for the Title Defect Property attributable to such
Subject Defect, at Seller Representatives option, exercisable at any time
within ten (10) days after the end of the Cure Period or within three (3) days
after the date the remaining Title Defect Amount is determined, whichever is
later, the Seller Representative and Buyer shall instruct Escrow Agent to pay
the amount deposited into escrow on account thereof to Buyer; and (ii) Buyer
shall reconvey the portion of the Assets that are subject to such Subject
Defect to the applicable Seller

 



      
 

 



 

without warranty of title, except as to matters arising by, through or under
Buyer; provided that if the escrowed amount is less than the Allocated Value
for such reconveyed Assets, the applicable Seller will promptly pay the
remainder of such Allocated Value to Buyer. In connection with any such
reconveyance, the Parties shall account to one another to place each Party in
the position it would have been if the original conveyance had not taken
place. For all other Subject Defects subject to this Section 4.05(d), the
Seller Representative and Buyer shall instruct Escrow Agent to pay the amounts
deposited in escrow in respect of any portion of the Subject Defect that was
cured to the applicable Seller, and pay the amounts deposited in escrow in
respect of any portion of the Subject Defect that was not cured to Buyer,
provided that if such escrowed amount is less than the amount to be paid to
Buyer, the applicable Seller will promptly pay the remainder of such amount to
Buyer.

 



 

(e) With respect to each Subject Defect that has been cured in accordance with
the provisions hereof prior to the expiration of the Cure Period, the Seller
Representative and Buyer shall jointly instruct Escrow Agent to pay the amount
deposited into escrow on account thereof to Sellers.

 



 

(f) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if as a result of
Sellers curative efforts and/or successful resolution of Title Defects
pursuant to Section 4.08(b) or of Environmental Defects pursuant to Section
5.06, the sum of all Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts is
reduced below the Defect Deductible, (i) the Seller Representative and Buyer
shall jointly instruct Escrow Agent to pay to Sellers all remaining amounts
deposited with Escrow Agent on account of Title Defects or Environmental
Defects and (ii) Buyer shall pay to Sellers any amounts by which the Purchase
Price was previously reduced on account of Title Defects or Environmental
Defects to the extent such amounts have not been previously paid to Sellers.

 



 

Section 4.06 _Title Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Should any Party discover any Title Benefit on or before the end of the
Title Examination Period that would have a Title Benefit Amount greater than
$50,000 in the aggregate, each Seller shall have the right, and Buyer shall
have the obligation, to notify Buyer or the Seller Representative, as
applicable, thereof on or before the end of the Title Examination Period,
which notice shall include (i) a description of the Title Benefit(s), (ii) the
Assets affected (each " **Title Benefit Property** "), (iii) the Allocated
Value of each Title Benefit Property, (iv) documentation sufficient to
reasonably support the asserted Title Benefit(s), and (v) the amount by which
the asserting Party reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title
Benefit Property is increased by the alleged Title Benefit(s) and the
computations and information upon which such Partys belief is based.

 



 

(b) With respect to each Title Benefit Property reported under Section 4.06(a)
for which the Title Benefit Amount is greater than $50,000 in the aggregate if
the net revenue interest of the Title Benefit Property is greater than the net
revenue interest stated on Exhibit C for Sellers and the working interest of
the Title Benefit Property is not increased on a proportional basis more than
the proportional increase in net revenue

 



      
 

 



 

interest, then an amount equal to the product of the Allocated Value of the
Title Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
actual net revenue interest increase of Sellers and the denominator of which
is the net revenue interest stated on Exhibit C for Sellers will be used
solely to offset against any Title Defect Amounts that result in downward
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.04(a)(iii). All other
Title Benefit Amounts shall be determined using the same considerations set
forth in Section 4.08(a)(iv) for Title Defect Amounts. The amount by which the
Purchase Price is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section
4.06(b) on account of a Title Benefit shall be referred to herein as the "
**Title Benefit Amount**."

 



 

Section 4.07 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (a) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price
or other remedies available to Buyer for any Title Defect if the sum of all
Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts does not exceed 2% of
the Purchase Price (the " **Defect Deductible** "), (b) Buyer will only be
entitled to one recovery for a matter which constitutes a Title Defect even if
such matter breaches another provision of this Agreement, and (c) if the sum
of all Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts exceeds the
Defect Deductible, then any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Sellers pursuant to Section 4.04 shall be applicable only
to the portion thereof that exceeds the Defect Deductible.

 



 

Section 4.08 _Title Defect Amount_.

 



 

(a) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the
aggregate amount by which the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property
affected by the applicable Title Defect is reduced as a result of the
existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the
following terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and the Seller Representative agree on the Title Defect Amount,
then that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (i) the net revenue
interest of Sellers for any Title Defect Property and (ii) the net revenue
interest stated in Exhibit C for Sellers for such Title Defect Property, and
there is a proportional decrease in Sellers working interest stated in
Exhibit C for such Title Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount shall
be the product of the Allocated Value of such affected Title Defect Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual decrease in net
revenue interest from that stated in Exhibit C and the denominator of which is
the net revenue interest stated in Exhibit C for Sellers;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated

 



      
 

 



 

Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property
(including the depths) affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the
Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life
of the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer
and the Seller Representative and such other reasonable factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation;

 



 

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to each Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 



 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.08 (except for
Section 4.08(a)(ii), to which this clause (vi) will not apply), the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon
each Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property.

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) If Buyer and the Seller Representative are unable to agree upon the Title
Defect Amount under this Section 4.08, or the validity of a Title Defect or
any cure thereof, and Sellers have not elected to cure such Title Defect
pursuant to Section 4.04(c), the Parties shall proceed to the Closing and the
following will apply:

 



 

(A) In the event that the unresolved portion of the Title Defect Amount
asserted in good faith by Buyer in the Title Defect Notice with respect to
such Title Defect exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property, at Seller Representatives option, exercisable at any
time up to three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Title Defect
Property will be excluded from the Assets at Closing and treated as Excluded
Assets for all purposes of this Agreement, and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property.

 



 

(B) For all other Title Defects subject to this Section 4.08(b) not excluded
from the Assets pursuant to Section 4.08(b)(i)(A):

 



 

(I) the Title Defect Property shall be conveyed to Buyer, the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the unresolved portion of the Title
Defect Amount asserted in good faith by Buyer in the Title Defect Notice with
respect to such Title Defect and such amount shall be paid by Buyer into an
escrow account established with Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of an
escrow agreement in a form acceptable to Escrow Agent and reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and the Seller Representative.

 



      
 

 



 

(II) Such matter(s) will be exclusively and finally resolved by agreement, or
by arbitration pursuant to this Section 4.08(b).

 



 

(III) The amount deposited into escrow will remain there until the matter is
exclusively and finally resolved by agreement, or by arbitration pursuant to
this Section 4.08(b).

 



 

(ii) With respect to any arbitration under this Section 4.08, there shall be a
single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years
experience in oil and gas titles involving Texas properties, as selected by
mutual agreement of Buyer and the Seller Representative within fifteen (15)
days after the Cure Period (in the case of arbitration pursuant to Section
4.05(c)) or the Closing Date (in the case of arbitration pursuant to this
Section 4.08), and absent such agreement, by the Houston office of the
American Arbitration Association (the " **Title Arbitrator** "). The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted
in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this Section 4.08(b). The Title Arbitrators determination shall be
made within twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding upon all Parties, without right of appeal. In
making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set
forth in Section 4.08(a) and elsewhere in this Article IV and may consider
such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or
helpful to make a proper determination. Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may
consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the arbitrator,
including petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for
the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect Amounts
submitted by a Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any
Party with respect to any matter. Buyer and the Seller Representative shall
each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. The
Seller Representative shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the
Title Arbitrator and Buyer shall bear the other half of such costs and
expenses. The Parties will implement the Title Arbitrators determination
pursuant to Section 4.08(b)(iii).

 



 

(iii) Within three (3) days of the Title Arbitrators decision with respect to
a Title Defect Property:

 



 

(A) if such Title Defect Property is included at Closing pursuant to Section
4.05(a), the provisions of Section 4.05(d) and Section 4.05(e), as applicable,
will apply to such Title Defect Property; or

 



 

(B) if the Title Defect Property was included at Closing pursuant to Section
4.08(b)(i)(B), Seller Representative and Buyer shall instruct Escrow Agent to
pay the amounts determined to be owed to the applicable Parties from the
Escrow Defect Deposits.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.09 _Special Warranty of Title_. The assignments delivered to Buyer
at Closing will contain a special warranty of title from each Seller to Buyer
warranting title to the Assets against every Person whomsoever lawfully
claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof by, through or under such
Seller, but not otherwise.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Preferential Rights To Purchase_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all Preferential
Rights relative to the sale of any of the Assets (provided that no Seller
shall be required to provide consideration, incur any expense or undertake
obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of the Preferential Rights,
except to the extent Buyer has agreed in writing to provide or reimburse such
consideration, incur or reimburse such expense or undertake such obligations
upon the occurrence of Closing), and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are expressly subject to all validly existing and applicable
Preferential Rights. In accordance with this Agreement and the applicable
Contracts, promptly after the Execution Date, Sellers shall deliver written
notices of the proposed transfer of any Asset subject to the Preferential
Rights to the holders of such Preferential Rights. The Seller Representative
shall promptly notify Buyer if any Preferential Right is exercised or if the
requisite period has elapsed without said right having been exercised. If a
Third Party who has been offered an interest in any Asset pursuant to a
Preferential Right timely elects, prior to the Closing, to purchase such Asset
pursuant to the aforesaid offer, and Sellers receive written notice of such
election prior to Closing, the Asset or part thereof so affected will be
eliminated from the Assets, the Purchase Price will be reduced proportionately
by the Allocated Value attributable thereto and the Parties shall proceed to
the Closing. Otherwise the Assets shall be conveyed to Buyer at Closing
subject to any Preferential Right applicable to the transactions that has not
been waived. If a Third Party elects to purchase any Asset pursuant to a
Preferential Right applicable to the transactions after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall be obligated to convey such Asset to such Third Party and shall be
entitled to the consideration for the sale of such Asset.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Consents to Assignment_. Prior to Closing, Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents (provided that no
Seller shall be required to provide consideration, incur any expense or
undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such Consents,
except to the extent Buyer has agreed in writing to provide or reimburse such
consideration, incur or reimburse such expense or undertake such obligations
upon the occurrence of Closing). Sellers shall deliver written requests for
such Consents to the holders thereof. If (a) Sellers fail to obtain a Consent
three (3) days prior to Closing and (b) the failure to obtain such Consent
would cause the assignment of the Asset subject thereto to Buyer to be void or
would materially affect the operation of such Asset or any other Asset, then
the portion of the Assets subject to such failed consent shall constitute a
Title Defect (without giving effect to the duration of the Title Examination
Period, the requirements associated with the submission of Title Defect
Notices, the Title Defect Threshold or the Defect Deductible) and Sellers and
Buyer shall have the rights and remedies set forth in Section 4.04 and Section
4.08 with respect thereto.

 



       
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE V 
ENVIRONMENTAL**

 



 

Section 5.01 _Environmental Examination Period_.

 



 

(a) Commencing on the date hereof and ending May 9, 2014, at 6:00 p.m.
Houston, Texas time (the " **Environmental Examination Period** "), Sellers
shall, subject to Third Party operator and surface owner approval (which, upon
Buyers request, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
provided that Sellers shall not be required to provide consideration, incur
any expense or undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of
such approval rights) and the provisions of Section 7.01, permit Buyer and/or
its representatives, in a reasonable manner, at reasonable times and at
Buyers sole risk, cost and expense, to conduct a Phase I ESA of the Assets;
provided, however, that Buyer shall provide Seller Representative with at
least two (2) Business Days notice prior to conducting any on-site
inspections in connection with each such Phase I ESA; and provided, further,
that each such Phase I ESA shall be limited to a visual inspection of the
Assets (although Buyer may move dirt or ground coverings at the surface
location to obtain such a visual inspection, subject to the requirements of
subsection (f) below), it being understood that no soil or water tests, other
samplings or borings thereof may be conducted without the Seller
Representatives prior consent.

 



 

(b) In the event that Buyers Phase I ESA identifies actual or potential
"recognized environmental conditions" with respect to any Asset, then Buyer
may request (any such request, a " **Phase II Request** ") in writing the
Seller Representatives permission to conduct additional Phase II
environmental property assessments to further assess such conditions. Each
Phase II Request will state with reasonable specificity (i) the actual or
potential "recognized environmental conditions" identified and (ii) the
proposed scope of the Phase II assessment, including a description of the
activities to be conducted, and a description of the approximate location and
expected timing of such activities. The Seller Representative may, in its sole
discretion, approve said Phase II environmental property assessment plan, in
whole or in part, and Buyer shall not have the right to conduct any activities
set forth in such plan until such time that the Seller Representative has
approved such plan in writing. Any such approved Phase II environmental
property assessment plan shall be conducted by a reputable environmental
consulting or engineering firm. The Seller Representative shall have the right
to (x) condition any approval of said Phase II environmental property
assessment plan on the provision of proof of satisfactory insurance and (y) if
said plan is approved by the Seller Representative, have its representatives
witness all on-site activities set forth in said Phase II environmental
property assessment plan and split any samples collected in connection
therewith. If the Seller Representative does not provide its consent to any
Phase II Request delivered in accordance with the above terms within two (2)
Business Days of Buyers delivery of such request, Buyer may elect, at its
sole election, to (A) submit the "recognized environmental conditions"
identified in the Phase I ESA as the basis of an Environmental Defect pursuant
to this ARTICLE V or (B) exclude the Asset (or portion thereof) for which
consent is not provided from the Assets to be conveyed at Closing, in which
case, such Asset (or portion thereof so affected) shall become an Excluded
Asset, and at Closing, the Allocated Value of all Assets excluded pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

this Section 5.01(b) shall be deducted from amounts payable by Buyer to
Sellers at the Closing.

 



 

(c) Buyer agrees (i) to provide to the Seller Representative, upon request, a
copy of any portion of any written environmental assessments of the Assets
conducted by or on behalf of Buyer, including any reports, data and
conclusions, to the extent such portion relates to an Environmental Defect
described in any Environmental Defect Notice delivered by Buyer, and (ii)
prior to Closing, to maintain the confidentiality of the information set forth
in such assessments with respect to the Assets, except to the extent
disclosure is required under applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Each Party agrees that it will not (and will cause its officers and
Affiliates not to) use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.01
for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall coordinate its environmental site assessments and physical
inspections of the Assets with the Seller Representative to minimize any
inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by Sellers insofar
as possible without interfering with Buyers ability to conduct a thorough
examination of the Assets. Buyer shall abide by Sellers, and any Third Party
operators, safety rules, regulations and operating policies (to the extent
same have been previously provided to Buyer) while conducting its due
diligence evaluation of the Assets, including any environmental or other
inspection or assessment of the Assets.

 



 

(f) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and
expense and without any cost or expense to any Seller or any of its
Affiliates, (i) repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with
Buyers due diligence in accordance with recognized industry standards or
requirements of Third Party operators, (ii) restore the Assets to the
approximate same or better condition than existed prior to commencement of
Buyers due diligence, but limited to the full extent of any damage related to
Buyers due diligence, and (iii) remove all equipment, tools or other property
brought onto the Assets in connection with Buyers due diligence. Any
disturbance to the Assets (including any real property, platform or other
fixtures associated with the Assets) resulting from Buyers due diligence will
be promptly corrected by Buyer.

 



 

Section 5.02 _Environmental Defect_. An Asset shall be deemed to have an "
**Environmental Defect** " if Buyer discovers that such Asset is subject to
(a) a condition existing on or before the expiration of the Environmental
Examination Period with respect to air, soil, subsurface, surface waters,
ground waters and/or sediments that causes such Asset not to be in compliance
with Environmental Law or any provision of any Lease addressing environmental
issues, or the existence on or before the expiration of the Environmental
Examination Period of any environmental pollution, contamination, degradation,
damage or injury with respect to any Asset for which remedial or corrective
action is required (or upon the passage of time will be required) under
Environmental Laws or any provision of any Lease addressing environmental
issues; and (b) with respect to which the Lowest Cost Response therefor is
reasonably estimated to require an expenditure in excess of $50,000 in the
aggregate; provided that (A) an Environmental Defect shall not be deemed to
exist with respect to NORM in connection with in-

 



      
 

 



 

use equipment and (B) an Asset for which an SPCC is required, but is not in
place, will, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute the basis of an
Environmental Defect for purposes hereof.

 



 

Section 5.03 _Notice of Environmental Defects_. To assert a claim for an
Environmental Defect, Buyer must promptly notify the Seller Representative
thereof prior to the expiration of the Environmental Examination Period. To be
effective, such notice (an " **Environmental Defect Notice** ") shall be in
writing and shall include (a) a detailed description of the alleged
Environmental Defect(s), (b) the Assets affected thereby (each, an "
**Environmental Defect Property** "), (c) the value of each Environmental
Defect Property (which shall be the Allocated Value thereof), (d)
documentation sufficient to reasonably support the asserted Environmental
Defect(s), including a separate specific citation of the provisions of
Environmental Laws or Leases alleged to be violated and the related facts that
substantiate such violation, (e) Buyers requirement(s) to cure such
Environmental Defects(s), and (f) the amount which Buyer reasonably believes
is the Lowest Cost Response to cure the alleged Environmental Defect(s) and
the computations and information upon which Buyers belief is based. Any
matters that may otherwise constitute Environmental Defects (irrespective of
the $50,000 threshold referenced in the definition thereof) but that are not
specifically disclosed to the Seller Representative pursuant to an
Environmental Defect Notice prior to the expiration of the Environmental
Examination Period shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer, except (i) as
may otherwise be a breach of the representations and warranties of a Seller in
Section 6.01(l) and/or Section 6.01(r), (ii) for Buyers rights in connection
with Sellers indemnity obligations in item (b) of Section 12.03 to the extent
applicable to the representations and warranties in Section 6.01(l) and/or
Section 6.01(r), and (iii) for Buyers rights in connection with Sellers
indemnity obligations in items (a), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of Section 12.03, in
each case, which will not be affected or diminished by this waiver.

 



 

Section 5.04 _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Each Seller shall have the
option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure any Environmental Defect
prior to the Closing. Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Seller
Representative with respect to any attempt by a Seller to cure any such
Environmental Defect. In the event that any Environmental Defect asserted
prior to the expiration of the Environmental Examination Period is not cured
on or before the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, then,
subject to Section 5.06, the Seller Representative shall at its sole election
(subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.04) for such Environmental
Defect:

 



 

(a) subject to Section 5.05, cause the Purchase Price to be adjusted downward
by the Lowest Cost Response to cure such Environmental Defect (such adjustment
being herein referred to as the " **Environmental Defect Amount** "); or

 



 

(b) with respect to any Environmental Defect for which, in Buyers good faith
judgment, the Environmental Defect Amount exceeds seventy-five percent (75%)
of the Allocated Value for the Environmental Defect Property, cause the
applicable Sellers to retain the Environmental Defect Property attributable to
such Environmental Defect and reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to
the Allocated Value (or portion thereof allocable thereto) of each
Environmental Defect Property, in which event, subject to Section 11.01(c),
the Parties shall proceed to the Closing, the Environmental Defect Property
shall be retained by such applicable Sellers as an Excluded Asset.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will have the right to cause such
applicable Sellers to retain the Environmental Defect Property attributable to
any Environmental Defect for which, in Buyers good faith judgment, the
Environmental Defect Amount exceeds seventy-five percent (75%) of the
Allocated Value thereof, and reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to
the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property, in which event,
subject to Section 11.01(c), the Parties shall proceed to the Closing and the
Environmental Defect Property shall be retained by such Sellers as an Excluded
Asset.

 



 

Section 5.05 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (a) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price
or other remedies available to Buyer for any Environmental Defect if the sum
of all Environmental Defect Amounts and Title Defect Amounts does not exceed
the Defect Deductible, (b) Buyer will only be entitled to one recovery for a
matter which constitutes an Environmental Defect even if such matter breaches
another provision of this Agreement, (c) if the sum of all Environmental
Defect Amounts and Title Defect Amounts exceeds the Defect Deductible, then
any adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be applicable only to the portion
thereof that exceeds the Defect Deductible and (d) Section 5.04 (as limited by
this Section 5.05) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
but excluding (i) Section 6.01(l) and Section 6.01(r) and any remedies
described in this Agreement for a breach of such Sections and (ii) Buyers
rights in connection with Sellers indemnity obligations in item (b) of
Section 12.03 with respect to Section 6.01(l) and Section 6.01(r), and (iii)
Buyers rights in connection with Sellers indemnity obligations in items (a),
(c), (d), (e) or (f) of Section 12.03, be the exclusive right and remedy of
Buyer with respect to any Environmental Law, any other environmental matter
with respect to the Assets or any Sellers breach of any representation or
warranty with respect to Environmental Laws, and Buyer waives any and all
other rights, at Law or in equity, with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 5.06 _Environmental Arbitrator_. If Buyer and the Seller
Representative are unable to agree upon the Environmental Defect Amount with
respect thereto, or the validity of such Environmental Defect, the Parties
shall proceed to the Closing, the Environmental Defect Property will be
excluded from the Assets at Closing, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property and
such amount shall be paid by Buyer into an escrow account established with
Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement in a form acceptable
to Escrow Agent and reasonably acceptable to Buyer and such Sellers. The
amount deposited into escrow will remain there until the matter is exclusively
and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 5.06. There shall
be a single arbitrator, who shall be an attorney or environmental consultant
with at least ten (10) years experience in environmental issues involving
Texas oil and gas properties, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and the
Seller Representative within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date, and
absent such agreement, by the Houston office of the American Arbitration
Association (the " **Environmental Arbitrator** "). The arbitration proceeding
shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 5.06. The
Environmental Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20) days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon
all Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Article V
and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental
Arbitrator are necessary

 



      
 

 



 

or helpful to make a proper determination. Additionally, the Environmental
Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise
the arbitrator. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects
and/or Environmental Defect Amounts submitted by a Party and may not award
damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.
Anything in this Section 5.06 to the contrary notwithstanding: (a) Buyer may
not introduce or otherwise use information obtained by Buyer after the date of
the Environmental Defect Notice with respect to the Environmental Defect in
dispute or its Environmental Defect Amount, and in no event may the
Environmental Arbitrator consider or give weight to any such information, (b)
Buyer may not assert any violation of Environmental Law that is not specified
in the Environmental Defect Notice with respect to the Environmental Defect in
dispute, and (c) the Environmental Defect Amount of an Environmental Defect
may not exceed the amount thereof asserted in the Environmental Defect Notice
with respect thereto. Buyer and the Seller Representative shall each bear its
own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. The Seller
Representative shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the
Environmental Arbitrator and Buyer shall bear the other half of such costs and
expenses. Within three (3) days of the Environmental Arbitrators decision,
(i) Sellers shall convey the Environmental Defect Property to Buyer using the
form of Assignment, (ii) the Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect
Property shall be paid to Sellers from the Escrow Defect Deposits with respect
thereto (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 3.04 and as may be adjusted
downward by the Environmental Defect Amount therefor, if any, determined
pursuant to this Section 5.06) and (iii) the amount of any such downward
adjustment shall be paid to Buyer from such Escrow Defect Deposits (provided
that if the amount of such Escrow Defect Deposits is not sufficient to fund
the payment of such downward adjustment amount to Buyer, Sellers shall
directly pay the remaining amount of such adjustment to Buyer); provided,
however, that Buyer will have the right (in lieu of receiving the
Environmental Defect Property pursuant to the preceding clause) to forever
exclude any such Environmental Defect Property from the transactions
contemplated hereby in the event that, as a result of the Environmental
Arbitrators decision, it is determined that the Environmental Defect Amount
for the Environmental Defect Property exceeds seventy-five percent (75%) of
the Allocated Value thereof.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

 



 

Section 6.01 _Representations and Warranties of Each Seller_. Each Seller
severally represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

(c) _Authorization_. Such Seller has the power to enter into and perform this
Agreement and each Transaction Document to which it is or will be a party, and
to

 



      
 

 



 

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. If such Seller is
an entity, the execution and delivery by such Seller of this Agreement and
each Transaction Document to which it is or will be a party, and the
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly and
validly authorized by all requisite action by such Sellers governing body and

fifty (150) days following the Closing Date. During the foregoing periods of
time, any Party may at its own expense audit any other Partys books, accounts
and records relating to production proceeds, operating expenses and taxes paid

The occurrence of the Closing shall not relieve any Party of its obligation to
account to the other Parties after the Closing with respect to amounts that
are received or become due after the Closing and that are properly payable or
chargeable to a Party pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) If the Seller Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters
addressed in the Dispute Notice, each of Buyer and the Seller Representative

render a decision choosing either the Seller Representatives position or
Buyers position with respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice,
based on the materials described above. The Accounting Arbitrator may not
award damages or penalties to any Party. Any decision rendered by the
Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding
on Sellers and Buyer and will be enforceable against such Parties in any court
of competent jurisdiction. The costs of such Accounting Arbitrator shall be

with Governmental Authorities all documents required in connection therewith,
including those documents delivered pursuant to Section 9.03(d). Sellers do
not warrant or guarantee that Buyer will become the operator under any
applicable joint operating agreements; however, each Seller will reasonably
assist Buyer in its efforts to succeed Operator as operator of any Wells;

expense or undertake obligations to or for the benefit of Buyer except as
specifically provided in this Agreement.

Assets to Buyer and to accomplish the orderly transfer of the Assets to Buyer
in the manner contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the Party
requesting any such information, documents or other acts and things shall,

the Closing, the Parties will cooperate to have all proceeds received
attributable to the Assets to be paid to the proper Party hereunder and to
have all expenditures to be made with respect to the Assets to be made by the
proper Party hereunder.

 



 

Section 10.05 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing for a period of

with any Proceedings, (ii) information that has become part of the public
domain through no action of any Seller identified on Schedule 10.07(a), its
Affiliates or any of its Additional Obligated Persons after the Closing, (iii)
information that is acquired independently from a Third Party representing

disclosed pursuant to activities associated with securing capital and/or other
financing commitments for Persons engaged in the upstream oil and gas

industry in connection with the disclosure of confidential information in such
context, or (v) disclosures permitted in writing by the chief executive

(b) comment publicly on the transactions contemplated herein, except for (i)
disclosures required by Law or in connection with any Proceedings, or (ii)

Section 10.06 _Suspense Accounts_. At Closing, each Seller shall transfer to
Buyer all funds held by such Seller, or such Sellers rights to such funds if
held by Third Parties, in remaining suspense related to proceeds of production
and attributable to Third Parties interests in the Leases or Hydrocarbon
production therefrom, including those funds listed in Schedule 10.06 and all
other funds suspended under division orders and funds suspended for title and
other defects (collectively the " **Suspense Accounts** "). If such funds or
rights to such funds are transferred to Buyer, Buyer agrees to administer all
such accounts and assume all payment obligations relating thereto in
accordance with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations and shall be liable
for the payment thereof to the proper parties and such obligations shall
become part of the Assumed Obligations.

 



 

Section 10.07 _Certain Acquisitions by Sellers_.

 



 

(a) If, at any time prior to the first anniversary of the Closing, (i) any
Additional Obligated Person (in each case, an " **Acquiring Party** "),
directly or indirectly acquires any interest in any oil, gas and/or mineral
lease in the Restricted Area (an " **Acquired Interest** ," but limited to the
portion of such interest included in the Restricted Area), whether by lease,
sublease, purchase, farmout, acquisition of shares or other equity interests
in an entity directly or indirectly owning the Acquired Interest or otherwise,
the Acquiring Party shall, or the Seller to whom such Acquiring Party relates
shall cause such Acquiring Party to, provide written notice (an " **Offer
Notice** ") to Buyer. Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
acquire such Acquired Interest on the same

 



      
 

 



 

terms and conditions that the Acquiring Party acquired the Acquired Interest.
It is understood that Assets excluded pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement shall not constitute Acquired Interests.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of the Offer
Notice to notify the Acquiring Party in writing whether it elects to acquire
the Acquired Interest. Failure of Buyer to give timely notice of such election
shall be deemed an election not to acquire the Acquired Interest. In the event
any Acquiring Party fails to provide an Offer Notice with respect to any
Acquired Interest, Buyer may provide notice to such Acquiring Party that it
desires to acquire such Acquired Interest at any time after it learns of the
acquisition of such Acquired Interest, and any such notice will be deemed to
be a timely election to acquire such Acquired Interest. If Buyer timely elects
to acquire the Acquired Interest, then the Buyer and the Acquiring Party shall
enter into agreements (and the Seller to whom such Acquiring Party relates
shall cause such Acquiring Party to enter into such agreements) for the
transfer of the applicable interest from the Acquiring Party to Buyer. The
Buyer and the Acquiring Party shall execute and deliver the applicable
documents, including an assignment substantially in the form of the
Assignment, and take such other actions as shall be reasonably required to
accomplish the transfer promptly after Buyers exercise of its option (and the
Seller to whom such Acquiring Party relates shall cause such Acquiring Party
to take all such actions). Any such Acquired Interest shall be deemed to be an
Asset for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.08 _Indemnity Escrow_. In order to provide security for Sellers
indemnification obligations under this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow shall
be held by Escrow Agent, and disbursed by Escrow Agent after the Closing in
accordance with this Section 10.08 and the Escrow Agreement. With respect to
each claim for indemnification asserted by Buyer against Sellers pursuant to
Section 12.03 or special warranty claim pursuant to the Assignment during the
period from and after the Closing Date up to the date that is nine (9) months
following the Closing Date (the " **Escrow Termination Date** "), upon final
resolution or determination of such an indemnity or warranty claim by the
Parties or in accordance with Section 12.11, as applicable, Buyer and Seller
Representative shall jointly instruct Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer the
amount set forth in such joint instruction, which will be that portion of the
Indemnity Escrow being held in the Indemnity Escrow account as would satisfy
such finally resolved or determined indemnity or warranty claim, together with
a pro rata portion of the then-accrued interest on the Indemnity Escrow. On
the Escrow Termination Date, Sellers shall, subject to the remainder of this
sentence, be entitled to receive the Indemnity Escrow balance as of such time
and such amount shall be automatically distributed to Sellers in the
proportions requested by Seller Representative pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement (and Buyer and the Seller Representative shall jointly
instruct Escrow Agent to take any necessary actions in order to accomplish the
foregoing); provided, however, that Sellers at such time shall not be entitled
to, and Escrow Agent shall retain, any amounts necessary to satisfy any
unresolved Claim Notices that have been timely delivered by Buyer in
accordance with Section 12.11 (which amounts shall remain in the Indemnity
Escrow until such Claim Notices are finally resolved). If there are remaining
amounts due by any Seller to Buyer pursuant to its indemnity obligations under
Section 12.03 after the Indemnity Escrow balance is exhausted, then such
amounts shall be promptly paid to Buyer by such Seller as they are agreed by
the Parties or finally determined in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. If there are any funds

 



      
 

 



 

remaining in the Indemnity Escrow account after the resolution of all
previously outstanding Claim Notices, then the Seller Representative and Buyer
shall promptly jointly instruct Escrow Agent to release the remaining account
balance to Sellers in the proportions requested by Seller Representative
within three (3) Business Days of its receipt of such joint instruction.

 



 

Section 10.09 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing upon receipt by such
Seller of notice of any pending or threatened tax audits or assessments
relating to the income, properties or operations of such Seller that
reasonably may be expected to give right to a lien on the Assets. Buyer shall
promptly notify the Seller Representative and Sellers shall promptly notify
Buyer in writing upon receipt of any pending or threatened tax audit or
assessment challenging the allocation pursuant to Section 3.03.

 



 

(b) Any payments made to any Party pursuant to Article XII shall constitute an
adjustment of the Purchase Price for tax purposes and shall be treated as such
by Buyer and each Seller on their tax returns to the extent permitted by Law.

Section 12.09, Section 13.01 and Article XIV (other than Section 14.01, 14.02
and 14.07), this Agreement shall thereafter be null and void and no Party
shall have any rights or obligations under this Agreement, except that nothing
herein shall relieve any Party from Liability for any willful breach of its
covenants or agreements hereunder; provided that, anything in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, the retention of the Deposit shall be
Sellers sole and exclusive remedy as provided in Section 3.02 and shall
constitute full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages Sellers may
have against Buyer (excluding under Section 7.01 and under the Confidentiality
Agreement). If any Party to this Agreement resorts to legal proceedings to
enforce this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such proceedings shall be
entitled to recover all costs incurred by such Party including reasonable
attorneys fees, in addition to any other relief to which such Party may be
entitled; provided, however, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in no event shall any Party be entitled to receive any
indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, or damages for lost
profits of any kind or loss of business opportunity. Upon such termination,
each Seller shall be free to immediately enjoy all rights of ownership and to
sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of its interest in the Assets to
any other Person without any restriction under this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII 
ASSUMPTION AND INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

Section 12.01 _Assumption and Indemnity_. From and after the Closing, but
without limiting Buyers rights to indemnity under this Agreement (including
Section 12.03) or Buyers rights under any other express provision hereof,
Buyer assumes and agrees to pay, perform and discharge all obligations and
Liabilities with respect to the Assets regardless of whether such obligations
or Liabilities arose prior to, on or after the Effective Time, including:

 



 

(i) all obligations (whether arising by Law or by contract) to properly plug
and abandon all Wells and dismantle, decommission or remove all personal
property, fixtures and related equipment included in the Assets and now
located on the Lands covered by or attributable to the Leases, Wells or other
Assets or hereafter placed thereon, and all such obligations to cleanup and
restore such lands;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) all Liabilities attributable to the Assets arising from, attributable to
or alleged to be arising from or attributable to, a violation of, or the
failure to perform any obligation imposed by, any Environmental Law;

 



 

(iii) all obligations applicable to the lessee under any of the Leases; and

 



 

(iv) any obligations or Liabilities arising out of Section 10.05.

 



 

All such assumed obligations and Liabilities described above in this Section
12.01 being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " **Assumed
Obligations** "; provided, however, that Buyer does not assume (and the
Assumed Obligations hereunder shall not include) any Retained Liabilities.

 



 

Section 12.02 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of Closing, Buyer hereby defends, releases, indemnifies and
holds harmless each Seller and all of its Affiliates, and all of their
respective members, shareholders, partners, officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives, subsidiaries, successors and assigns (collectively,
the " **Seller Indemnitees** ") from and against any and all Liabilities
(whether or not relating to Third Party claims or incurred in the
investigation or defense of any of the same or in asserting, presenting or
enforcing any of their respective rights hereunder) caused by, arising from,
attributable to or alleged to be caused by, arising from or attributable to
(i) the Assumed Obligations, (ii) the breach by Buyer of any of its
representations or warranties contained in Section 6.02 of this Agreement or
in any certificate furnished by or on behalf of Buyer in connection with this
Agreement, (iii) the breach by Buyer of its covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement, provided that Buyer has no obligation to indemnify any
Seller Indemnitee for any Liability for which Sellers are obligated to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to Section 12.03 and (iv)
incorporation of the Financial Statements (and the information reflected
therein) into the SEC Documents (except to the extent of any material
misstatement therein or material omission therefrom attributable to any Seller
or Controlled Affiliate of a Seller). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
above, no Specified Affiliate of any Seller shall be entitled to
indemnification for the matters described in item (i) above, and no agent or
representative of any Seller (including any auditor) will be entitled to
indemnification for the matters described in item (iv) above.

 



 

(b) In addition to the indemnities set forth in Section 12.02(a), but subject
to Sellers retention of the Retained Liabilities and any rights Buyer may
have following the Closing with respect to any Environmental Defect pursuant
to Section 5.06 and any breach of the provisions of Section 6.01(l) and
Section 6.01(r), effective as of the Closing, Buyer and its successors and
assigns shall assume (as part of the Assumed Obligations), be responsible for,
shall pay on a current basis and hereby defend, indemnify, hold harmless and
forever release the Seller Indemnitees from and against any and all
Liabilities arising from, based upon, related to or associated with any
environmental condition or other environmental matter related or attributable
to the Assets, regardless of whether such Liabilities arose prior to, on or
after the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, including the presence, disposal or removal of any Hazardous Materials
or other material of any kind in, on or under the Assets and including any
Liability of any Seller Indemnitees with respect to the Assets under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended (42 U.S.C. §§ 9601 _et. seq_.), the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. § 6901 et. seq.), the Clean Water Act (33
U.S.C. §§ 466 _et. seq_.), the Safe Drinking Water Act (14 U.S.C. §§
1401-1450), the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. §§ 1801 _et.
seq_.), the Toxic Substance Control Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2629), the Clean
Air Act (42 U.S.C. § 7401 _et. seq_.) as amended, the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 and all state and local Environmental Laws, provided that Buyer has no
obligation to indemnify any Seller Indemnitee for any Liability for which
Sellers are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to Section
12.03.

 



 

Section 12.03 _Indemnification by Sellers_. From and after Closing, each
Seller hereby severally defends, indemnifies and holds harmless Buyer and all
of its Affiliates, and all of their respective members, shareholders,
partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, attorneys,
subsidiaries, successors and assigns (collectively, the " **Buyer
Indemnitees** ") from and against any and all Liabilities (whether or not
relating to Third Party claims or incurred in the investigation or defense of
any of the same or in asserting, presenting or enforcing any of their
respective rights hereunder) caused by, arising from or attributable to or
alleged to be caused by, arising from or attributable to (a) the Excluded
Assets owned by such Seller (including the ownership, use and operation
thereof), (b) the breach by such Seller of any of its representations or
warranties contained in Section 6.01 of this Agreement or in any certificate
furnished by or on behalf of such Seller in connection with this Agreement,
(c) the breach by such Seller of any of its covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement, (d) the actions, suits or proceedings, if any, described in
Schedule 6.01(f), (e) the continuing responsibility of such Seller under
Section 2.04, and (f) the Retained Liabilities. In the event one or more Buyer
Indemnitees is entitled to indemnification from Sellers pursuant to the terms
of this Section 12.03, and in such case the breach or other Liability giving
rise to such right to indemnification is not specific to a particular Seller
or a particular Sellers interest in the Assets, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that any such Liabilities with respect to such breach and/or
indemnification shall be based on each Seller partys proportionate share of
the Assets (determined based on the same proportions as the Purchase Price,
prior to any adjustment thereto, is distributed among Sellers as certified in
writing by the Seller Representative). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary above, no Specified Affiliate of Buyer shall be entitled to
indemnification for the matters described in items (a) or (f) above.

 



 

Section 12.04 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:
no Seller shall incur or have any liability to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees
under Section 12.03(b) (except with respect to breaches of any Fundamental
Representations or breaches of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(j)(i) (to the extent such breaches of Section
6.01(j)(i) arose during the period which the Assets have been owned by a
Seller)) unless (a) the individual amount of any Liability subject to
indemnification is greater than or equal to $100,000 and (b) where the
aggregate total of all such Liabilities for which all Sellers are liable under
this Agreement (after the application of the provisions of clause (a) above)
equals or exceeds 2% of the Purchase Price (the " **Indemnity Deductible** ").
In the event that the sum of all such Liabilities exceeds the Indemnity
Deductible,

 



      
 

 



 

then such Sellers obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees shall be
applicable only to the portion thereof that exceeds the Indemnity Deductible.
For avoidance of doubt, no Seller will have any obligation or Liability to
Buyer Indemnitees under this Article XII for amounts for which a downward
adjustment was made to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.04. For the
sole purpose of determining whether the amount of any Liability with respect
to a claim for indemnification associated with a breach of representation or
warranty hereunder exceeds the individual $100,000 threshold or collectively
with all other claims, the Indemnity Deductible, any dollar thresholds or
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers in such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded. Sellers aggregate liability under Section
12.03(b) for breaches of representations and warranties (other than breaches
of Fundamental Representations and breaches of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 6.01(j)(i) (to the extent such breaches of
Section 6.01(j)(i) arose during the period which the Assets have been owned by
any Seller)) shall be limited to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price.

 



 

Section 12.05 _Negligence and Fault_. THE DEFENSE, RELEASE, INDEMNIFICATION
AND HOLD HARMLESS OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING SECTION
12.02 AND SECTION 12.03) SHALL ENTITLE THE INDEMNITEE TO SUCH DEFENSE,
RELEASE, INDEMNIFICATION AND HOLD HARMLESS HEREUNDER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
TERMS HEREOF, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH OBLIGATION
IS THE RESULT OF: (A) STRICT LIABILITY, (B) THE VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OR OTHER
FAULT BY SUCH INDEMNITEE OR AS A RESULT OF A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, OR (C)
THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH
INDEMNITEE (BUT EXPRESSLY EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT
OF SUCH INDEMNITEE). BUYER AND SELLERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT IS
CONSPICUOUS.

 



 

Section 12.06 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to Section 12.06(c), it is the
intention of the Parties that this Article XII shall govern the allocation of
risks and Liabilities between Buyer and each Seller except to the extent that
it is expressly stated (whether elsewhere in this Article XII or in some other
Article of this Agreement) that the provisions of such other Article (or part
thereof) shall control over the terms of this Article XII.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(other than Section 12.06(c)), from and after Closing, this Article XII
contains the Parties exclusive remedy against each other with respect to
breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 6.01 and
6.02 of this Agreement and the covenants and agreements of the Parties
contained in this Agreement and the affirmations of such representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in any certificate delivered by
each Party at Closing.

 



 

(C) The provisions of Section 12.06(a) and Section 12.06(b) shall in no way
limit the Parties rights and remedies under the provisions of Article IV or
Article V, to

 



       
 

 



 

the extent that such rights and/or remedies may be exercisable or otherwise
applicable from and after the Closing in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

Section 12.07 _Expenses_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
foregoing defense, release, indemnity and hold harmless obligations shall not
apply to, and each Party shall be solely responsible for, all expenses,
including due diligence expenses and legal and accounting expenses, incurred
by such Party in negotiating this Agreement and consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.08 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of each Seller in
Section 6.01 (other than the Fundamental Representations and the
representation and warranty in Section 6.01(j)(i)) shall survive until the
Escrow Termination Date, the Fundamental Representations shall survive the
Closing without time limit and the representation and warranty in Section
6.01(j)(i) shall survive the Closing for two years. Representations and
warranties shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration; provided, however, that there shall be no termination of any bona
fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a
representation or warranty prior to its expiration date. Subject to the
foregoing, the remainder of this Agreement shall survive the Closing without
time limit; provided, however, that the indemnities in Section 12.03(b) shall
terminate as of the termination date of each respective representation or
warranty that is subject to indemnification pursuant thereto (except in each
case as to matters for which a bona fide claim was asserted pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such a representation or warranty prior to its
expiration date).

 



 

Section 12.09 _Non-Compensatory Damages_. NONE OF THE BUYER INDEMNITEES NOR
SELLER INDEMNITEES SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER FROM ANY SELLER OR BUYER, OR
THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, OF ANY KIND, OR LOSS OF
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH PARTY
SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES (INCLUDING COSTS OF DEFENSE AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS
FEES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH DEFENDING OF SUCH DAMAGES) TO A THIRD PARTY,
WHICH DAMAGES (INCLUDING COSTS OF DEFENSE AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES
INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH DEFENDING AGAINST SUCH DAMAGES), IF OTHERWISE
SUBJECT TO AN INDEMNITY HEREUNDER, SHALL NOT BE EXCLUDED BY THIS PROVISION AS
TO RECOVERY HEREUNDER. SUBJECT TO THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, BUYER, ON BEHALF OF
EACH OF THE BUYER INDEMNITEES, AND EACH SELLER, ON BEHALF OF EACH OF SELLER
INDEMNITEES OF SUCH SELLER, WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER PUNITIVE, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS OR
LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH OR WITH RESPECT TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

Section 12.10 _Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes_. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity
statute relating to

 



      
 

 



 

oilfield services and associated activities shall not be applicable to this
Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 12.11 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
this Article XII and Section 7.01 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Indemnitor** " when used in
connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Person having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such
Liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, and the term " **Indemnitee** " when
used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean a Person having the
right to be indemnified with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under this Article XII or Section
7.01, an Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor of its claim, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the
" **Claim Notice** "). In the event that the claim for indemnification is
based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnitee (a " **Claim** "),
the Indemnitee shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnitee
has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the Claim; provided that the failure of any
Indemnitee to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 12.11 shall
not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this Article XII except to
the extent (and only to the extent of such incremental Liabilities incurred)
such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the
Indemnitor to effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the
Indemnitors ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached.

 



 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
notify the Indemnitee whether or not it admits or denies its liability to
indemnify and defend the Indemnitee against such Claim under this Article XII
at the sole cost and expense of Indemnitor. The Indemnitee is authorized,
prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or
other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnitor and that is not prejudicial to the
Indemnitor.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnitor admits its liability to indemnify the Indemnitee, it
shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and
expense, the Claim. The Indemnitor shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof (subject to the
remainder of this Section 12.11(d)). If requested by the Indemnitor, the
Indemnitee agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnitor
elects to contest (provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall not be
required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The
Indemnitee may participate in, but not control, at its sole cost and expense,
any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnitor pursuant
to this Section 12.11. An

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnitee, settle
any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that
(i) does not result in a final resolution of the Indemnitees Liability with
respect to the Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional
written release of the Indemnitee from all Liability in respect of such Claim)
or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnitee (other than as a
result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

 



 

(e) If the Indemnitor (x) does not agree to indemnify the Indemnitee within
the thirty (30) day period specified in Section 12.11(c), (y) fails to give
notice to the Indemnitee within such thirty (30) day period regarding its
election or (z) admits its liability to indemnify but fails to diligently
defend or settle the Claim, then (in each case) the Indemnitee shall have the
right to defend against the Claim at the sole cost and expense of Indemnitor
with counsel of the Indemnitees choosing; provided, however, that the
Indemnitee shall make no settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgment
that would give rise to Liability on the part of any Indemnitor without the
prior written consent of such Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
(i) cure the Liability complained of, (ii) agree to indemnify the Indemnitee
for such Liability, or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liability. If such
Indemnitor does not respond to such Claim Notice within such thirty (30) day
period, such Person will be deemed to dispute the claim for Liability.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this Section 12.11, and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Buyer and its Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled
to deal exclusively with the Seller Representative (for and on behalf of
itself and any Seller) in connection with the above described procedures.

(d) OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 6.01(L) OR SECTION 6.01(R) OF
THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CERTIFICATE DELIVERED TO BUYER AT CLOSING, NO SELLER

Section 13.02 _Casualty/Condemnation Loss_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in Sections 13.02(b) and (c), Buyer hereby assumes all
risk of loss with respect to, and any change in the condition of, the Assets
from the Effective Time until Closing, including for production of
Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including the watering-out of any well,
collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well), the depreciation of
personal property due to ordinary wear and tear or any diminution of value
resulting from industry-wide or regional fluctuation in markets or economies.

 



 

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing, any part of the
Assets shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or if any part
of the Assets shall be taken in condemnation under the right of eminent domain
or if proceedings for such purposes shall be pending or threatened (each, a "
**Casualty/Condemnation Loss** "), and the loss as a result of such individual
Casualty/Condemnation Loss exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price,
Buyer shall not be required to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Should Buyer elect to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Seller Representative and Buyer shall agree in writing prior to
Closing, either (i) to cause the Assets affected by any such
Casualty/Condemnation Loss to be repaired, restored or replaced, as
applicable, to at least its condition prior to such Casualty/Condemnation
Loss, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work
may extend after the Closing Date), or (ii) to treat such
Casualty/Condemnation Loss as a Title Defect with respect to the affected
Asset or Assets under Section 4.04 (but without regard to the limitations of
Section 4.07). In each case, Sellers shall retain all rights to insurance and
other claims against Third Parties with respect to the Casualty/Condemnation
Loss except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

 



 

(c) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing, any portion of the
Assets is subject to a Casualty/Condemnation Loss, and the loss as a result of
such individual Casualty/Condemnation Loss is twenty percent (20%) or less of
the Purchase Price, Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Sellers shall, at Closing,
reduce the Purchase Price in an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the
Asset affected by the Casualty/Condemnation Loss. If Buyer agrees, Sellers
shall in lieu of a Purchase Price reduction contemplated above, pay to Buyer
and assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of
Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid
awards, and other rights against Third Parties (other than Affiliates of
Sellers that are not Specified Affiliates of Sellers, and its and their
directors, officers, employees and agents) arising out of the
Casualty/Condemnation Loss.

supplemented, amended, altered, modified or terminated. IN THE EVENT OF A
CONFLICT BETWEEN: (A) THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS
AND PROVISIONS OF ANY SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO, THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL; OR (B) THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, THE
TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE SCHEDULES OR EXHIBITS HERETO OR ANY
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OF TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS SHALL BE
GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 14.03.

 



 

Section 14.04 _Waiver_. Any of the terms, covenants, representations,
warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a written instrument
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving compliance. Except as provided
in the preceding sentence, no waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or rights hereunder shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of
any other provisions hereof or rights hereunder (whether or not similar), nor
shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided. The rights of the Parties under this Agreement shall be cumulative,
and the exercise or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude the
exercise of any other right.

 



 

Section 14.05 _Publicity_. Each Party shall consult with each other Party
prior to making any public release concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and, except as required by applicable Law or
by any Governmental Authority or stock exchange, no Party shall issue any such
publicity or other release without the prior written consent of each other
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Unless a
Party otherwise consents or unless required under applicable securities Laws,
no Party or any of its Affiliates shall disclose the name of any other Party
or its principals in press releases or other public disclosures, and, to the
extent permitted under applicable Law, shall cause the

 



      
 

 



 

name of such other Party or its principals to be redacted from any electronic
copy of this Agreement and from electronic copies of any other agreement or
document to be filed pursuant to applicable securities Laws. Sellers shall be
further subject to the terms and conditions of Section 10.05. In the event of
any inconsistency between the terms of this Section and Section 10.05, the
term of Section 10.05 shall prevail.

 



 

Section 14.06 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except with respect to Section
7.10 and the Persons included within the definition of Seller Indemnitees or
Buyer Indemnitees (and in such cases, only to the extent expressly provided
herein), nothing in this Agreement shall provide any benefit to any Third
Party or entitle any Third Party to any claim, cause of action, remedy or
right of any kind, it being the intent of the Parties that this Agreement
shall not be construed as a Third Party beneficiary contract; provided that
only a Party will have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement
on its own behalf or on behalf of any of its related indemnitee parties (but
shall not be obligated to do so).

 



 

Section 14.07 _Assignment_. Except as may be expressly set forth in this
Agreement, no Party may assign or delegate any of its rights or duties under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party and any
assignment made without such consent shall be void. Any assignment of this
Agreement made by a Party as permitted hereby shall not relieve such Party
from any Liability or obligation under this Agreement. Except as otherwise
provided herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors, assigns and
legal representatives.

 



 

Section 14.08 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS AMONG
THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF TEXAS, EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW RULE OR PRINCIPLE THAT MIGHT
REFER CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH PROVISIONS TO THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. ALL
OF THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO THE EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION IN PERSONAM BY
THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS FOR ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 14.09 _Notices_. Any notice, communication, request, instruction or
other document required or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing and
delivered in person or sent by United States mail (postage prepaid, return
receipt requested), recognized overnight delivery service or facsimile (with a
copy of such notice or other communication also delivered by electronic mail)
to the addresses of Sellers and Buyer set forth below. Any such notice shall
be effective upon receipt (which, for purposes of a facsimile transmission,

normal business hours or, if not received during normal business hours, on the
next Business Day.

Any Party may, by written notice so delivered, change its address for notice
purposes hereunder.

 



 

Section 14.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

 



 

Section 14.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original
instrument, but all such counterparts shall constitute but one instrument. Any
signature hereto delivered by a Party by facsimile transmission shall be
deemed an original signature hereto.

 



 

Section 14.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument
in writing executed by all Parties.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 14.13 _Schedules and Exhibits_. The inclusion of any matter upon any
Schedule or any Exhibit attached hereto does not constitute an admission or
agreement that such matter is material with respect to the representations and
warranties contained herein.

 



 

Section 14.14 _Seller Representative_. Each Seller (excluding Operator) hereby
constitutes and appoints Operator as such Sellers true and lawful agent,
representative and attorney-in-fact hereunder (including under any escrow
agreement entered in connection herewith, under which Operator will serve as
the party thereto on behalf of Sellers) (the " **Seller Representative** "),
to act in the name and on behalf of such Seller to take any action authorized
or required to be taken by the Seller Representative pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, each Seller agrees that Operator shall be
authorized on such Sellers behalf and responsible hereunder, to, among other
things, (a) deliver and receive all notices, statements, reports, and other
information given by or addressed to Sellers hereunder, (b) receive all
amounts payable to Sellers hereunder and distribute to Sellers their pro rata
portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price net of their pro rata portion of all
escrow fees, brokerage fees and attorneys fees directly related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) make, on a joint basis, all
decisions, elections and similar rights that Sellers are entitled to make
hereunder (including any amendments to this Agreement), and (d) otherwise
perform all of the obligations of Seller under this Agreement. Operator shall
be responsible for delivering to each Seller all such notices, statements,
reports, and other information, and disbursing to Sellers their respective
proportionate shares of all amounts received by Operator on their behalf.
OPERATOR AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS, AND EACH SELLER
RELEASES, BUYER AND ITS AFFILIATES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES IN
FAVOR OF SUCH SELLER ARISING OUT OF, OR RESULTING IN ANY WAY FROM, THE
PERFORMANCE AND DISCHARGE, OR THE FAILURE TO PERFORM OR DISCHARGE, BY OPERATOR
OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THIS SECTION 14.14. Each Seller has executed and
delivered to Buyer, or will execute and deliver to Buyer within three (3)
Business Days after the Execution Date, a power-of-attorney evidencing the
power-of-attorney granted by such Seller to Operator in connection with the
foregoing matters.

 



 

Section 14.15 _Section 1031 Exchange_. Each Seller and Buyer hereby agree
that Buyer shall have the right at any time prior to the Closing to assign all
or a portion of its rights under this Agreement to a "Qualified Intermediary"
(as that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) of the Treasury
Regulations) in order to accomplish the transaction in a manner that will
comply, either in whole or in part, with the requirements of a like-kind
exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code. Likewise, each Seller shall
have the right at any time prior to the Closing to assign all or a portion of
its rights under this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary for the same
purpose. In the event a Party assigns its rights under this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 14.15, such Party agrees to notify the other Parties in
writing of such assignment at or before the Closing. If a Seller assigns its
rights under this Agreement for this purpose, Buyer agrees to consent to such
Sellers assignment of its rights in this Agreement and pay such Sellers
portion of the Purchase Price (or designated portion thereof and as adjusted
pursuant hereto) into a qualified escrow or qualified trust account at the
Closing as directed in writing. If Buyer assigns its rights under this
Agreement for this purpose, each Seller agrees to (i) consent to Buyers
assignment of its rights in this Agreement, (ii) accept its portion

 



       
 

 



 

of the Purchase Price (or designated portion thereof and as adjusted pursuant
hereto) from the qualified escrow or qualified trust account at the Closing,
and (iii) at the Closing, convey and assign directly to Buyer the Assets upon
satisfaction of the other conditions to the Closing and other terms and
conditions hereof. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that (a) the
Closing shall not be delayed or effected by reason of any assignment of this
Agreement as described in this Section 14.15, (b) any assignment of this
Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary shall not release any Party from any of
their respective liabilities and obligations under this Agreement, (c) no
Party, by its consent granted under this Section 14.15, will be responsible in
any way for any other Partys compliance with the requirements of a like-kind
exchange under Section 1031 of the Code and (d) that no Party represents to
another Party that any particular tax treatment will be given to any Party as
a result thereof.

 



 

Section 14.16 _Jurisdiction_. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be brought in the courts of the State of Texas, in Harris County, and the
federal courts in the Southern District of Texas. Each of the Parties (i)
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding, (ii)
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum, (iii) will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and
(iv) will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Process in any
such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the
world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without
limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such
Party as provided in Section 14.09 will be deemed effective service of process
on such Party.

 



 

Section 14.17 _Several Liability_. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, it is understood that the obligations and Liabilities of
Sellers under this Agreement and in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby are several (and not joint and several).

 



 

Section 14.18 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and the Parties shall
be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof and immediate
injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy available at law or in
equity.

 



 

Section 14.19 _EXCLUSIVE REMEDY_. THE PARTIES HAVE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO
DEFINE THEIR RIGHTS, LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER
OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCLUSIVELY IN CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS AND
PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO
RELY ON THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH PARTY IN THIS
AGREEMENT, IN THE ASSIGNMENT, ANY ADDITIONAL

 



      
 

 



 

ASSIGNMENT OR IN ANY CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY A PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY
PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM THAT
THEY ARE OWED ANY DUTIES OR ARE ENTITLED TO ANY REMEDIES NOT EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY CERTIFICATE DELIVERED HEREUNDER), IN
THE ASSIGNMENT OR IN ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH. FURTHERMORE, THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AGREEMENT
EMBODIES THE JUSTIFIABLE EXPECTATION OF SOPHISTICATED PARTIES DERIVED FROM
ARMS LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS, AND ALL PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO PARTY HAS ANY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER PARTY THAT
WOULD JUSTIFY ANY EXPECTATION BEYOND THAT OF AN ORDINARY BUYER AND AN ORDINARY
SELLER IN AN ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION. THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY
BREACH OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN) SHALL BE THOSE REMEDIES
AVAILABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (AS SUCH REMEDIES MAY BE FURTHER LIMITED OR
EXCLUDED PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT), OR THE SPECIAL
WARRANTY OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE ASSIGNMENT AND ANY ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENT,
AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO RELY ON (X) THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH PARTY IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN THE
ASSIGNMENT OR ANY ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENT AND/OR (Y) ANY REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO
SUCH PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, THE PARTIES
HEREBY WAIVE AND RELEASE ANY AND ALL TORT CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION THAT MAY
BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY TORT CLAIM OR CAUSE
OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR AS AN INDUCEMENT TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT). WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, FROM AND
AFTER THE CLOSING, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF EACH SELLER AND BUYER
(OTHER THAN THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE ASSIGNMENT OR ANY
ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENT, AS APPLICABLE, OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS OR REMEDIES
AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT) FOR ANY AND ALL
(A) CLAIMS RELATING TO ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND
AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, (B) OTHER CLAIMS PURSUANT TO OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND (C) OTHER CLAIMS RELATING TO THE ASSETS AND
THE PURCHASE AND SALE THEREOF SHALL BE ANY RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION FROM SUCH
CLAIMS THAT IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND IF NO SUCH RIGHT OF
INDEMNIFICATION IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED AND NO REMEDY IS AVAILABLE PURSUANT TO
THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE ASSIGNMENT OR ANY ADDITIONAL
ASSIGNMENT OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, THEN SUCH
CLAIMS ARE HEREBY WAIVED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
