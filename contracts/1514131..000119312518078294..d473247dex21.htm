Consideration, shall be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 
---|---|--- 
 

(b) All of the shares of Seller Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any
such shares of Seller Common Stock, including, for this purpose,
any restricted stock outstanding pursuant to a Seller Restricted Stock Award
as evidenced by a certificate (each, an " _Old C_ _ertificate_ "; it being
understood that any reference herein to an " _Old Certificate_ " shall be
deemed to include reference to book-entry accounts evidencing ownership of
shares of Seller Common Stock) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (i) the Merger Consideration in accordance with, and subject
to, Section 1.6(a), (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares that the
shares of Seller Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.6 and Section
2.2(e), without any interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions
that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b).

number or kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other

 



3  similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary
dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be
made to the Merger Consideration to give holders of Seller Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all Excluded Shares (other than the Exception Shares) shall be

surrender agreement in a form acceptable to Seller and Parent, converted into
the right to receive from Seller Bank the amount by which the sum of $2.54 and
the Effective Time Value per share exceeds the exercise or strike price of
such Seller Stock Option. The number and terms of Seller Stock Options will
not exceed or differ from the number and terms disclosed in Section 3.2(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. If the exercise price of a Seller

restricted stock outstanding immediately prior thereto pursuant to the Seller
Stock Plans (" _Seller Restricted Stock Award"_ ) shall automatically lapse

shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Seller Bank shall cease. The
parties agree that the Bank Merger shall become effective at the time

ARTICLE II. EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available_.

 

At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, (a) New Certificates (if any, and if no
certificates are being issued, evidence of book entry ownership) representing
the aggregate Stock Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 and
Section 1.7 and exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(a), and (b) cash in an
amount sufficient to pay (i) the 

 



5  aggregate Cash Consideration payable to holders of Seller Common Stock
(including any restricted stock outstanding pursuant to a Seller Restricted
Stock Award) and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and
New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with
any future dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable or the amount of payments due under Section 1.7(a). Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five (5) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of shares of Seller Common Stock (including
any restricted stock outstanding pursuant to a Seller Restricted Stock Award)
(a " _Holder_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (that shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange
Agent), (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration to which such Holder
shall have become entitled in accordance with, and subject to, Section 1.6(a)
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares that the shares represented
by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to this Agreement) as well as any dividends or
distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). From and after the
Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal duly executed, the Holder
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New
Certificate representing the Stock Consideration to which such Holder shall
have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, Section
1.6(a) and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the Cash Consideration
that such Holder has the right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old
Certificate or Old Certificates in accordance with, and subject to, Section
1.6(a) (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares that such Holder has the
right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and (C) any dividends or distributions
that the Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares, or dividends payable to Holders. Until
surrendered as contemplated by Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as
contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate
until such Holder shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the Holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends
or other distributions, without any interest

 



6  thereon, that theretofore had become payable with respect to the Stock
Consideration that the shares of Seller Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Seller of the shares of Seller Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
applicable Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and
dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates
is entitled to, as provided in this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent; provided that, when determining the fractional
shares to be cashed out, all resulting fractional shares held by the same
Holder shall, to the extent practicable, be combined into the greatest number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock as possible, and thereafter the holder
shall receive cash in lieu of any remaining fractional share. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former
shareholder of Seller who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the Effective Time Value by (ii) the fraction of a share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent
Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 1.6. 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Seller for one (1) year after the Effective Time, if Parent
so elects by notice to the Exchange Agent, shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation. If Parent so elects, any former shareholders of Seller who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in
lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of 

 



7  Seller Common Stock (including any restricted stock outstanding pursuant to
a Seller Restricted Stock Award) such shareholder holds as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Seller, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Seller Common Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the applicable Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Seller Common
Stock, Exception Shares, Seller Stock Options or Seller Restricted Stock
Awards (Seller Stock Options and Seller Restricted Stock being referred to as
the " _Seller Eq_ _uity Awards_ ") such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over
to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Seller Common Stock or Seller Equity Award in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

 

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent or Parent, as applicable, will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the applicable
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Seller hereby represents and warrants to Parent as set forth in this Article
III, except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Seller to
Parent concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Seller
Disclosure Schedule_ "); _provided_ , that (a) the mere inclusion of an item
in the Seller Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Seller that such item represents
a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (b) any
disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article III shall be deemed
to qualify (i) any other section of this Article III specifically referenced
or cross-referenced and (ii) any other sections of this Article III to the
extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections.

 



8 3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Indiana and is registered with the
Federal Reserve Board as a savings and loan holding company under the Home
Owners Loan Act (" _HOLA_ "). Seller has the corporate power and authority to
own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted in all material respects. Seller is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Seller. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Mate_ _rial_ _Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Parent, Seller or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i)
the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (
_provided, however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse
Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the
date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GA_ _AP_ ")
or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, or changes in interest rates
or general economic conditions, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws,
rules or regulations, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental
Entities, that apply to financial and/or depository institutions and/or their
holding companies generally, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the financial
services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or
its Subsidiaries, (D) the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings
projections or internal financial forecasts or any decrease in the market
price of a partys common stock, but not including the underlying causes
thereof, (E) disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or actions expressly required by this Agreement in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (F) any claim, suit, action,
audit, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or other proceeding or order
initiated other than by a party to this Agreement that in any manner
challenges, seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay, or seeks damages as a
result of or in connection with, the transactions this Agreement
contemplates, (G) actions or omissions taken pursuant to the written consent
or request of Parent, in the case of Seller, or the written consent or request
of Seller, in the case of Parent, including expenses incurred by the parties
in consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (H) public
disclosure of any matter to the extent that (1) it is disclosed in reasonable
detail in the partys disclosure schedule delivered to the other party
pursuant to this Agreement or in the Parent Financial Statements or Seller
Financial Statements for periods prior to the date of this Agreement, as
applicable, and (2) such disclosed matter does not worsen in a
materially adverse manner; except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), (C)
or (D), to the extent that the effects of such change are materially
disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry
in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such
party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in
this Agreement,

 



9  the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party, means any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank, trust or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, that is (x)
consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes or (y) directly
or indirectly (through one or more intermediaries) controlled by or owned more
than fifty percent by such party. True and complete copies of the Articles of
Incorporation of Seller (the " _Seller Articles_ ") and the Bylaws of Seller
(the " _Seller Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by Seller to Parent.

(b) Each Subsidiary of Seller (i) is duly organized and validly existing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do
business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good
standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where
its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires
it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would
reasonably be likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Seller and (iii) has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of Seller to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of
a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. Section
3.1(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list
of all Subsidiaries of Seller as of the date hereof. There is no person whose
results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity or
financial position are consolidated in the financial statements of Seller
other than the Subsidiaries of Seller.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Seller consists of twenty-five million
25,000,000 shares of Seller Common Stock, and one million (1,000,000) shares
of serial preferred stock, par value, $0.01 per share (" _Seller Preferred S_
_tock_ "). No shares or other voting securities of Seller are issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding, other than (i) 4,472,023 shares of Seller Common
Stock issued and outstanding, which number includes 41,841 shares of Seller
Common Stock granted in respect of outstanding Seller Restricted Stock Awards,
(ii) 212,563 shares of Seller Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of outstanding Seller Stock Options, and (iii) 931,945 shares of
Seller Common Stock held in treasury. Since December 31, 2017 through the date
hereof, Seller has not issued or repurchased any Seller Common Stock, other
shares of its capital stock or other voting securities or securities
convertible or exchangeable into, or exercisable for, Seller Common Stock,
shares of its capital stock or other voting securities or any options,
warrants, or other rights of any kind to acquire Seller Common Stock, any
shares of its capital stock or other voting securities of Seller. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right
to vote on any matters on which shareholders of Seller may vote are issued or
outstanding. There are no contractual obligations of Seller or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which Seller or its Subsidiaries could be required to
register shares of capital stock or other securities of Seller or its

 



10  Subsidiaries under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "). No trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries are issued or outstanding. Other than Seller Equity
Awards issued prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of this
Agreement there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements obligating Seller to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, any shares of capital stock or voting securities of Seller
or any security exercisable for, exchangeable for, or convertible into shares
of capital stock or voting securities of Seller. Section 3.2(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all Seller
Equity Awards outstanding as of [December 31, 2017], specifying, on a holder-
by-holder basis, (A) the name of each holder, (B) the number of shares subject
to each such Seller Equity Award, (C) the grant date of each such Seller
Equity Award, (D) the Seller Stock Plan under which such Seller Equity Award
was granted, (E) the exercise price for each such Seller Equity Award that is
a Seller Stock Option, and (F) the expiration date of each such Seller Equity
Award that is a Seller Stock Option. Other than the Seller Equity Awards, no
equity-based awards (including any cash awards where the amount of payment is
determined in whole or in part based on the price of any capital stock of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
there are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has a
contractual or other obligation with respect to the voting or transfer of
the Seller Common Stock or other equity interests of Seller. As of the date
of this Agreement, Seller does not have in effect a "poison pill" or similar
shareholder rights plan (other than any such plan as to which the rights
granted thereunder have expired). Sellers Shareholders are not entitled to
dissenters rights under IBCL Chapter 23-1-44, because the shares of Seller
Common Stock are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ").

(c) Seller owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the
Subsidiaries of Seller, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Li_ _ens_ "), and all of
such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No
Subsidiary of Seller has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character
calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the
right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of such Subsidiary.

 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) Seller has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Seller. The
Board of Directors of Seller has 

 



11  determined that the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, is in the best interests of Seller and its shareholders and has
directed that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be
submitted to Sellers shareholders for adoption at a meeting of such
shareholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for
(i) the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of holders of
Seller Common Stock who are entitled to cast at least a majority of the total
votes that all holders of Seller Common Stock are entitled to cast on the
matter (the " _Requisite Seller Vote_ "), and (ii) the adoption and approval
of the Bank Merger Agreement by the Board of Directors of Seller Bank and
Seller as its sole shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Seller are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Seller and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent) constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms (except in
all cases as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting insured depository institutions and
their holding companies or the rights of creditors generally and subject to
general principles of equity, whether applied in a court of law or a court of
equity (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ")).

 

(b) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Seller nor the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated
hereby, will (i) violate any provision of the Seller Articles or the Seller
Bylaws or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to
in Section 3.4 are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute,

or other governmental authority or instrumentality or NASDAQ (each a "
_Governmental Entity_ ") are necessary in connection with (A) the execution
and delivery by Seller of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by Seller of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank
Merger). As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Seller, there is no
reason related to Seller why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents
will not be received in order to permit consummation of the Merger and Bank
Merger on a timely basis.

 

3.5 _Reports_.

 

(a) Seller and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished as
applicable) all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since July 1, 2012 with (i) any state
regulatory authority, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal Reserve Board, (iv) the
FDIC, (v) the OCC, (vi) any foreign regulatory authority, and (vii) NASDAQ
(collectively " _Regulatory Agencies_ "), and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except in any case which
failures to file (or furnish reports, registrations and statements), or pay
such fees and assessment, that would not reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a material effect on Sellers
compliance with requirements of the Regulatory Agencies. All such reports,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments made with respect
thereto, complied in all material respects with applicable requirements of
law and rules and regulations in effect at the time such reports,
registrations and statements were filed and contained in all material respects
the information required to be stated therein. Except for examinations of
Seller and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary
course of business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any
proceeding or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened any investigation into
the business or operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries since July 1,
2012. There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. 

 



13 (b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration
statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed
with or furnished to the SEC by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be since July 1, 2012
(the " _Seller SEC Reports_ "), is publicly available. No such Seller SEC
Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of
this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.
As of their respective dates, all Seller SEC Reports filed or furnished under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Seller
has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her
under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from, or material unresolved
issues raised by, the SEC with respect to any of the Seller SEC Reports.

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of Seller and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Seller SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (the " _Seller Financial Statements_ ") (i) have been
prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Seller and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders
equity and consolidated financial position of Seller and its Subsidiaries for
the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments
normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case,
as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and
records of Seller and its Subsidiaries have been since July 1, 2012, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. No auditing firm has resigned (or informed Seller that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Seller as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Seller on
a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether
due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Seller included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for

 



14  the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017 (including any notes thereto) and
for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since June 30, 2017, or in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Seller and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Seller or its Subsidiaries or accountants or vendors in the
ordinary course of business (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom). With respect to service provider oversight, Sellers and Seller
Banks information security program service conforms in all material respects
with the following to the extent applicable: Interagency Guidelines
Establishing Information Security Standards, 12 CFR Part 225 Appendix F; OCC
Bulletin 2013-29, OCC Bulletin 2017-21; Federal Reserve System "Guidance on
Managing Outsourcing Risk," December 5, 2013 (attached to FRB SR 13-19); and
The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council "Information Security
Booklet" as revised September 2016 and announced in Federal Reserve System
SR 16-14. Seller (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Seller, including its Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Seller
by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Sellers outside auditors and the audit committee of Sellers Board of
Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Sellers ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (B) to the knowledge of Seller, any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Sellers internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures were made in writing by management to Sellers auditors and audit
committee and a copy has previously been made available to Parent. To the
knowledge of Seller, there is no reason to believe that Sellers outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Since July 1, 2012, (i) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor,
to the knowledge of Seller, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Seller, oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and

 



15  (ii) no attorney representing Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Seller or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to
the Board of Directors of Seller or any committee thereof or to the knowledge
of Seller, to any director or officer of Seller.

 

3.7 _Broker_ __ _s Fees_.

 

Neither Seller, nor any Subsidiary of Seller, nor any of their respective
officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial advisor or
incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in
connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. pursuant to a letter
agreement, a true and complete copy of which has been previously provided to
Parent.

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

(a) Since June 30, 2017, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Seller.

(b) Since June 30, 2017, except with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, Seller and its
Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course.

 

3.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Section 3.9(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, or
governmental regulatory investigations of any nature that are pending, or to
the knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller or any of its subsidiaries.
Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are
no pending or, to knowledge of Seller, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their current or former directors or executive officers that, if adversely
determined against Seller or Seller Bank, (i) would have a Material Adverse
Effect on Seller or Seller Bank or (ii) would prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or declare the same to be unlawful or cause the rescission thereof.

 

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger,
would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates).

 

3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking into
account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which

 



16  Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are
complete and accurate in all material respects. Neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file
any material Tax Return. All material Taxes of Seller and its Subsidiaries
(whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and
timely paid or accurately accrued as liabilities on the balance sheet of
Seller and its Subsidiaries, and each of Seller and its Subsidiaries has
withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid
in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor,
shareholder, independent contractor or other third party. Neither Seller nor
any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation
period applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect. The federal
income Tax Returns of Seller and its Subsidiaries for all years up to and
including June 30, 2011 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service
(the " _IRS_ ") or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period
for assessment under applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or
waivers, has expired. No deficiency with respect to a material amount of Taxes
has been proposed, asserted or assessed against Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened (in writing) disputes,
claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any material Taxes
of Seller and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Seller and its Subsidiaries.
Since July 1, 2013, (such period, the " _Open Tax Year Period_ "), neither
Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed in writing by any
jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was not filed. Seller
has made available to Parent true, correct, and complete copies of any
private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition
agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed during the Open Tax
Year Period. There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not yet due
and payable) on any of the assets of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any
Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other
than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Seller and
its Subsidiaries). Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which was Seller) or (B) has any
liability for the Taxes of any person (other than Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has been,
since July 1, 2013 or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related
transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the
Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has
participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). At no time since July 1, 2011, has Seller
been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries will
be required to include any material item of income in, or to exclude any
material item of deduction from, taxable income in any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change
in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) closing 

 



17  agreement as described in Section 7121 of the Code, executed on or prior to
the Closing Date, (iii) intercompany transaction or excess loss account
described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (iv) installment sale or
open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, or (v)
prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date outside of the
ordinary course of business.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _T_ _ax_ " or " _Taxes_ " means all
federal, state, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, ad valorem,
profits, gains, property, capital, sales, transfer, use, license, payroll,
employment, social security, severance, unemployment, withholding, duties,
excise, windfall profits, intangibles, franchise, backup withholding, value
added, alternative or add-on minimum, estimated and other taxes, charges,
fees, levies or like assessments together with all penalties and additions to
tax and interest thereon.

(c) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Tax R_ _eturn_ " means any return,
declaration, report, claim for refund, estimate, or information return or
statement relating to Taxes, including any schedule or attachment thereto, and
including any amendment thereof, supplied or required to be supplied to a
Governmental Entity.

3.11 _Employees_.

 

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and
complete list of all Seller Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Seller B_ _enefit Plans_ " means all employee benefit plans (as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ER_ _ISA_ ")), whether or not subject to ERISA, whether or not
written, and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock
unit, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or
arrangements, and all retention, bonus, employment, termination, severance
plans, programs or arrangements or other contracts or agreements, and in each
case, whether or not funded and any trust, escrow or similar arrangement
related thereto, with respect to which Seller or any Subsidiary or any trade
or business of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated,
all of which together with Seller would be deemed a "single employer" within
the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (a " _Sell_ _er ERISA Affiliate_ "), has
any current or future obligation or that are maintained, contributed to or
sponsored by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any Seller ERISA Affiliate
for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer, director or
independent contractor of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any Seller
ERISA Affiliate.

 

(b) Seller has heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies of
each Seller Benefit Plan and the following related documents, to the extent
applicable, (i) the most recent copy of any summary plan descriptions,
amendments, modifications or supplements to any such Seller Benefit Plan, (ii)
the annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS for the last two
plan years, (iii) the most recently received IRS determination letter, if any,
relating to a Seller Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recently

 



18  prepared actuarial report for each Seller Benefit Plan (if applicable) for
each of the last two years, and (v) a written description of any unwritten
plan.

 

(c) Each Seller Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code, except as would not result
in any material liability. Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(c) of Sellers
Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has, within
the past three years, taken any action to take corrective action or make a
filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor
or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Seller Benefit Plan, and
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan
defect, whether or not it would qualify for correction under any such program.

 

(d) Section 3.11(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule identifies each Seller
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code (the " _Sell_ _er Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a favorable
determination letter (or in the case of a prototype plan, a favorable opinion
letter on which Seller may rely) with respect to each Seller Qualified Plan
and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation
been threatened in writing), and, to the knowledge of Seller, there are no
existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would have an adverse
effect on the qualified status of any Seller Qualified Plan or the related
trust or increase the costs relating thereto. No trust funding any Seller
Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code. 

(e) Section 3.11(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule identifies each Seller
Benefit Plan that is intended to be a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code); each such plan and any
award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code,
has (i) since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material
respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS
Notice 2005-1 and (ii) since January 1, 2008, been, in all material respects,
in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

(f) Seller has awarded Restricted Stock Awards and Seller Stock Options
pursuant to the Seller Stock Plans as described in Section 3.2(a). Seller has
not awarded any restricted stock units or performance share units pursuant to
the Seller Stock Plans.

 

(g) With respect to each Seller Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code: (i) no such
plan is in "at-risk" status for purposes of Section 430 of the Code, (ii) no
reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the
30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, (iii) all premiums
required to be paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PB_
_GC_ ") have been timely paid in full, (iv) no liability (other than for
premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) the PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any such Seller Benefit Plan; and (vi) such plan is
fully funded on a termination basis.

 



19 (h) None of Seller and its Subsidiaries nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate has,
at any time since January 1, 2011, contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has
two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer
Plan_ "), and none of Seller and its Subsidiaries nor any Seller
ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability to a Multiemployer Plan
or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as
those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that has not been satisfied in
full.

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has any
obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any
post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life
insurance benefits for retired or former employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof.

(j) All contributions required to be made to any Seller Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, all
applicable funding requirements applicable by law or by a plan document have
been met, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies
funding any Seller Benefit Plan, at any time since January 1, 2011, have been
timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid
on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and
records of Seller.

(k) There are no pending or, to knowledge of Seller, threatened claims (other
than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations
that have been asserted or instituted, and, to knowledge of Seller, no set of
circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit,
against the Seller Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to
their duties to the Seller Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts
under any of the Seller Benefit Plans that would, in any case, reasonably be
expected to result in any liability of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to
the PBGC, the IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple
Employer Plan, any participant in a Seller Benefit Plan or any other party.

 

(l) None of Seller, its Subsidiaries, nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate nor any
other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA)
that could subject any of the Seller Benefit Plans or their related trusts,
Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, any Seller ERISA Affiliate or any person
that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify to any
tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 

(m) Except as set forth in Sections 1.7 or 6.6, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event)
result in, cause or accelerate the vesting, exercisability or delivery of,
increase the amount or value of, any 

 



20  payment, right or other benefit, or result in any forgiveness of
indebtedness to, any employee, officer, director or individual independent
contractor of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any funding of,
or limitation on the right of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from, any Seller Benefit
Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of
benefits) by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(n) No Seller Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes
under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. Seller has made
available to Parent preliminary copies of Section 280G calculations (whether
or not final), which to the best of its knowledge are true, correct and
complete, with respect to any disqualified individual entitled to a
"parachute payment" as that phrase is used in Section 280G of the Code.

 

(o) No Seller Benefit Plan is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside
the United States.

 

(p) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing
material labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges
against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material
labor disputes against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Seller nor
any of its Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective bargaining or
similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices
agreed to with any labor organization or employee association applicable to
employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of
Seller, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking
to represent any employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. Seller and
each of its Subsidiaries is, and has at all relevant times been, in compliance
in all material respects with all applicable laws respecting employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, equal opportunity,
nondiscrimination, immigration, labor, wages, hours of work and occupational
safety and health, and is not engaged in any unfair labor practices defined
in the National Labor Relations Act or other applicable law.

(q) Seller sponsors and maintains an "employee stock ownership plan (" _ESOP_
") as defined in Section 4975(e) of the Code that satisfies the requirements
of such section. The shares of stock owned by the ESOP constitute
"employer securities" as defined in Section 409(l) of the Code and
"qualifying employer securities" as defined in Section 407(d)(5) of ERISA. To
Sellers knowledge, there have been no non-exempt "prohibited transactions"
or breaches of any of the duties imposed upon "fiduciaries" (within the
meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the ESOP
that could result in any liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code
being imposed upon Seller, its Subsidiaries, or any Seller ERISA Affiliate, or
any of the officers, directors, or employees of Seller, its Subsidiaries, nor
any Seller ERISA Affiliate.

ARTICLE IV. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

 

Parent hereby represents and warrants to Seller as set forth in this Article
IV, except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to
Seller concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (i) an item is required to be set forth as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article IV
shall be deemed to qualify (A) any other section of this Article IV

under the BHC Act. Parent has the corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified

 



33  would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. True and complete copies of the
Parent Articles and Parent Regulations, as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by Parent to Seller.

(b) Each Subsidiary of Parent (a " _Parent_ _Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,
and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There
are no restrictions on the ability of any Parent Subsidiary to pay dividends
or distributions except, in the case of a Parent Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each
Parent Subsidiary that is an insured depository institution are insured by the
FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by
law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith
have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such
insurance are pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened. Section
4.1(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list
of all Subsidiaries of Parent as of the date hereof. There is no person whose
results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity or

their terms (without amendment or waiver since December 31, 2017), or (B)
issued or awarded any options, restricted shares or any other equity based
awards under any of the Parent Stock Plans. All of the issued and outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock and the Series B Stock have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on
any matters on which shareholders of Parent may vote are issued or
outstanding. There are no contractual obligations of Parent or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which Parent or its Subsidiaries could be required to
register shares of capital stock or other securities of Parent or its
Subsidiaries under the Securities Act. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(a)
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, no trust
preferred or subordinated debt securities of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries are issued or outstanding. Other than the Series B Stock and

otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of
Parent.

 

(b) There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
a contractual or other obligation with respect to the voting or transfer of
the Parent Common Stock or other equity interests of Parent (other than as

shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of Parent Bank
and its other Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens except as disclosed on

preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. No Parent Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of

of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

 

4.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) Parent has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Parent. The
Board of Directors of Parent has determined that the Merger, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of Parent and
its shareholders and has directed that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby be submitted to Parents shareholders for adoption at
a meeting of such shareholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing
effect. Except for (i) the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote

approval of the Bank Merger Agreement by the Board of Directors of Parent Bank
and Parent as its sole shareholder, and (iii) the adoption of resolutions to
give effect to the provisions of Sections 6.10 and 6.14 in connection with the
Closing, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to
approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Seller) constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). The shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger have been validly authorized and, when issued,
will be (i) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no current or
past shareholder of Parent will have any preemptive right or similar rights in
respect thereof and (ii) will be issued in compliance with all
applicable state and federal securities laws. No vote or approval of the
holders of the Series B Stock is required in connection with the adoption of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Parent, nor the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated
hereby, will (i) violate any provision of the Parent Articles or the Parent
Regulations, or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings
referred to in Section 4.4 are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any

36  termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by,
or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of
clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations or creations that either
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

Except for (i) the filing of applications, filings and notices, as applicable,
with the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act and approval of such
applications, filings and notices, (ii) the filing of applications, filings

Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and
delivery by Parent of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by Parent of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Bank
Merger). As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, there is no
reason related to Parent why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents
will not be received in order to permit consummation of the Merger and Bank
Merger on a timely basis.

 

4.5 _Reports_.

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished as
applicable) all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2013 with any Regulatory
Agencies (including, without limitation, with the SEC and those required
under the federal securities laws), and have paid all fees and assessments due
and payable in connection therewith, except fees and assessments which the
failure to pay would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in
the aggregate, to have a material effect on Parents compliance with
requirements of the Regulatory Agencies. All such reports, registrations and
statements, together with any

 



37  amendments made with respect thereto, complied in all material respects with
applicable requirements of law and rules and regulations in effect at the time
such reports, registrations and statements were filed and contained in all
material respects the information required to be stated therein. Except for
examinations of Parent and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency
in the ordinary course of business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has
pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened any
investigation into the business or operations of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013. There is no unresolved
violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to
any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be since January 1, 2013
(the " _Parent SE_ _C Reports_ "), is publicly available. No such Parent SEC
Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date
of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date. As of their respective dates, all Parent SEC Reports filed or furnished
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of
Parent has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him
or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from, or material unresolved
issues raised by, the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Reports.

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") (i) have been
prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders
equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for
the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments
normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case,
as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and
records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been since January 1, 2012, and
are being, maintained in all material

 



38  respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. No auditing firm
has resigned (or informed Parent that it intends to resign) or been dismissed
as independent public accountants of Parent as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether
due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2017
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2017,
or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants or vendors in the
ordinary course of business (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom). With respect to service provider oversight, Parents and Parent
Banks information security program service conforms in all material respects
with the following to the extent applicable: Interagency Guidelines
Establishing Information Security Standards, 12 CFR Part 225 Appendix F; OCC
Bulletin 2013-29; OCC Bulletin 2017-21; Federal Reserve System "Guidance on
Managing Outsourcing Risk," December 5, 2013 (attached to FRB SR 13-19); and
The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council "Information Security
Booklet" as revised September 2016 and announced in Federal Reserve System
SR 16-14. Parent (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent
by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board of
Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (B) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures were made in writing by management to Parents auditors and audit
committee and a copy has previously been made available to Seller. To the
knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parents outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and

 



39  attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Parent,
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of Parent or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Parent, to
any director or officer of Parent.

4.7  _Broker_ __ _s Fees_.

Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers
or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial advisor or incurred
any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in
connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than Sandler, ONeill + Partners L.P.

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since December 31, 2017, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(b) Since December 31, 2017, except with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement or as
disclosed in Section 4.8(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent and its
Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course.

4.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of
any nature against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their current
or former directors or executive officers, including those that, if adversely
determined against Parent or Parent Bank, would prevent, impede or delay
the consummation of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or declare the same to be unlawful or cause the rescission thereof.

 



40 (b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or
regulatory restriction imposed upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the
Merger, would apply to the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates).

Parent and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since December
31, 2013, held, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct in all material respects of their respective
businesses and ownership of their respective properties, rights and assets
(and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith), and to the knowledge of Parent no suspension or cancellation of
any such necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened.
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects
with and are not in material default or violation under any applicable law,

the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer loans. Parent and
each of Parents Subsidiaries that is an insured depository institution is
"well-capitalized" and "well managed" (as those terms are defined under
applicable federal banking regulations). Each of Parents Subsidiaries that is
an insured depository institution has a Community Reinvestment Act rating of
"satisfactory" or better. None of Parent, or its Subsidiaries, or to the
knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, employee, agent or other person

(f) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or

may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against Parent
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to Parent

Plans, that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the DOL,

Parent Benefit Plan, or any other party.

(g) To the Knowledge of Parent, none of Parent and its Subsidiaries nor any
Parent ERISA Affiliate nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has
engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the IRC

their related trusts, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any Parent ERISA
Affiliate or any person that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has an

as competitively sensitive material, the receiving party shall request
confidential treatment of such information to the extent permitted by
applicable law, will permit the providing party to control at its expense the
defense of any challenge to such confidential treatment request and will not
disclose publicly any such information without the providing partys prior
consent. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult
with the other in advance of any meeting or

 



52  conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible,
including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of businesses or assets of Parent, Seller and their respective
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent or Seller or their
respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any actions specified in
this Section 6.1 that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a material and adverse effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (in each case, measured on a scale relative to Seller and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a " _Materiall_ _y Burdensome Regulatory
Condition_ ").

(d) Parent and Seller shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and Seller agrees, as to itself
and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the
time the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, is filed or
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the time of Seller Meeting and Parent Meeting
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statement was
made, not misleading and (iii) any statement, filing, notice or application
filed with any Governmental Entities to obtain the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals will contain, at the time each is filed, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of Parent and
Seller further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished
by it would cause any of the statements in the S-4 or the Proxy Statement to
be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate
steps to correct the S-4 or the Proxy Statement.

 



53 (e) Parent and Seller shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

6.2 _Access to Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of Parent and Seller, for the purposes of
verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for
the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, legal counsel, advisors and other representatives of
the other party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each
shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the
Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations
generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-
disclosure and similar agreements with such service providers and/or the other
party), and, during such period, each of Parent and Seller shall, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request, except to the extent such information relates to (i)
matters involving this Agreement, (ii) pending or threatened litigation or
investigations to the extent that, in the opinion of counsel, the availability
to the other party of such information would or might adversely affect any
privilege relating to that information, or, in the case of confidential
information that is not privileged, would reasonably be expected to either
cause Seller to breach or violate a legal obligation to a third party or have
a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or, (iii) matters involving an
Acquisition Proposal, except to the extent required by Section 6.11(c). Each
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference
with the other partys regular business operations during any such access.
Neither Parent nor Seller nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Parents or Sellers, as
the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due
consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or
similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will
attempt in good faith to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each of Parent and Seller shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated November 3, 2017, between Parent and Seller (the " _Con_
_fidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



54 (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein, except to the
extent it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the investigating
party had knowledge of the specific breach of the representation or warranty
in question prior to the date of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.2(a), Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide data processing, item processing and other
processing support and testing as reasonably required and requested by Parent
to result in a successful conversion of the data and other files and records
of Seller and its Subsidiaries to Parents production environment (the "
_Conv_ _ersion_ "). Those efforts of Seller shall be performed in a manner
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that a successful Conversion will
occur at the time provided herein. Parent may elect, by a writing to Seller
after the date hereof and prior to filing the application for approval of the
Merger and the Bank Merger from the Federal Reserve Board a Conversion time
that is either, (x) the time that is immediately following the Merger and the
Bank Merger (such an election in this clause (x), a " _Sim_ _ultaneous
Conversion Election_ ") or (y) such later date as may be specified by Parent,
in each case, subject to any applicable laws, including laws regarding the
exchange of information and other laws regarding competition. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall, subject to any such applicable
laws: (i) reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a project plan as
specified by Parent to effectuate the Conversion; (ii) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have Sellers outside contractors continue to support at
Parents expense, both the Conversion effort and Sellers incremental
Conversion needs until the Conversion can be established; (iii) provide, or
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any outside
contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably requested by
Parent, at Parents expense, for use in planning the Conversion, as soon as
reasonably practicable; (iv) provide reasonable access to Sellers personnel
and facilities and, with the consent of its outside contractors and at
Parents expense, its outside contractors personnel and facilities, to the
extent reasonably necessary to enable the Conversion effort to be completed on
schedule; and (v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon the completion
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the contracts of
outside data, item and other processing contractors or other third-party
vendors to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries are bound if reasonably
requested to do so by Parent to the extent permitted by such contracts;
_provided_ , that Seller shall not be required to take any action that would
prejudice or adversely affect in any material respect its rights under any
such contracts in the event the Closing does not occur. 

6.3 _Shareholder Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 6.11, Seller shall take, in accordance with applicable
law and the Seller Articles and Seller Bylaws, all action necessary to
convene a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Seller_ _Meeting_ ") to be held
as soon as reasonably practicable

 



55  after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Seller Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the
type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders
to adopt a merger agreement. Subject to the rights of the Board of Directors
set forth in Section 6.11, including the right to accept or approve a
Superior Proposal, cancel or delay the Seller meeting, change or withdraw its
recommendation of this Agreement and/or terminate this Agreement as
contemplated in Section 6.11(d), the Board of Directors of Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of
Seller the Requisite Seller Vote, including by communicating to its
shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Subject to Section 6.11, Seller shall adjourn or postpone the Seller
Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled
there are insufficient shares of Seller Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Seller has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the
Requisite Seller Vote; _provided_ , that Seller shall not be required to
adjourn or postpone the Seller Meeting more than two times pursuant to this
Section 6.3(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, including
in accordance with Section 6.11, the Seller Meeting shall be convened and
this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Seller at the Seller
Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the
other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve Seller of such obligation.

(c) Parent shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Parent
Articles and Parent Regulations, all action necessary to convene a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _Parent Meeting_ ") to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Parent Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of
the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of
shareholders to adopt a merger agreement. The Board of Directors of Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of
Parent the Requisite Parent Vote, including by communicating to its
shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) Parent shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting, if, as of the time
for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares
of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting Parent has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Parent Vote;
provided, that Parent shall not be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent
Meeting more than two times pursuant to this Section 6.3(d).

 



56 6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger._

 

Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 of this Agreement, each
of Parent and Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the
Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain
(and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by Seller or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_.

 

Parent shall take all steps necessary to cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.6 _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_. 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable good faith efforts to minimize the impact
of the Merger and the Bank Merger on employees of Seller and Seller Bank,
consistent with Parents and Parent Banks plans for the operations of the
business of the combined entities following the Effective Time; _provided,
however_ , that this Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of
Parent or Parent Bank to close a Seller Bank branch or other Seller Bank
facility or terminate the employment of any Seller employee. Parent and Parent
Bank will offer Seller Bank employees whose jobs are eliminated as a result
of the Bank Merger the opportunity to apply for open positions within Parent
and Parent Bank and, with respect to employees who are not employed by Parent
or Parent Bank, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay severance
to such employees in accordance with Section 6.6(d) of this Agreement. Parent
agrees that each employee who is considered an exempt employee and who is
terminated or who voluntarily terminates employment pursuant to this Section
6.6(a) shall receive outplacement services with a reputable outplacement firm
for a period of six (6) months from the date of the employees termination,
and Parent or Parent Bank shall pay all expenses related to the provision of
such outplacement services.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Pl_ _ans_ "), Parent
shall: (i) waive all exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and
their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Seller Benefit
Plan, (ii) to the extent permitted by the New Plans and commercially
practicable, provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with
credit for any co-payments or co-insurance and deductibles paid prior to
the Effective Time under a Seller Benefit Plan (to

 



57  the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Seller
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible, co-payment, co-insurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements
under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with
Seller and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same
extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous Seller
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that the foregoing
service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of
any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides retiree
welfare benefits, (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides
grandfathered benefits, or (D) to the extent prohibited by law or the plan
documents.

 

(c) Parent will honor all obligations under the employment and change in
control agreements that are identified in Section 6.6(c)-A of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, except to the extent any such agreement is superseded or
terminated as of, or following, the Effective Time. Concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall obtain from those persons named in
Section 6.6(c)-B of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, in the form included in
Section 6.6(c)-C of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, an executed settlement
agreement (a "Settlement Agreement") to accept full settlement of their rights
under their respective employment agreements. Parent agrees that the change in
control agreements noted in Schedule 6.6(c) - A of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule will be paid out as of the Effective Time, without regard to each
contracted employees continued employment by Parent or its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time. As noted in the change in control agreements
listed on Schedule 6.6(c) - A of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no payments
will be made or benefits provided to the contracted individuals in excess of
each contracted individuals 280G limit as set forth in Section 6.6(c)-C of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Distribution of benefits in connection with
the payment of the change in control benefits provided for under the change in
control agreements set forth in Section 6.6(c) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule will be paid in accordance with the process set forth in Section
6.6(k) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

(d) Parent will honor the obligations set forth in the Seller Banks Employee
Severance Compensation Plan, as amended effective January 15, 2018. In
addition to severance provided under Sections 6.6(c) and 6.6(d) of this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation will cooperate with Seller to create a
retention pool or other incentive bonus plan and pay retention bonuses to
certain employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries identified by Parent after
consulting with Seller, as critical to data processing or other transition
tasks or who are otherwise determined by Parent to be key officers or
employees. Retention bonuses may have a vesting term of up to one year, with
bonus forfeiture occurring for termination before vesting. Retention bonuses,
if any, would be in addition to any bonus for which any former officer or
employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries may be eligible as an employee of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent Bank.

(e) Seller shall take all actions as are necessary, including the adoption of
Board of Directors or compensation committee resolutions or consents, to
terminate Sellers 401(k) plan, effective no later than the day immediately
prior to the Effective Time, with such termination to be subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time. Prior

 



58  to taking any such action, Seller shall provide Parent with a copy of such
resolutions or consent in connection with such plan termination, and shall
consider any comments provided by Parent in good faith. To the extent
applicable, Parent shall cause the 401(k) plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries
to accept as soon as practicable cash rollover distributions from current and
former employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries with respect to
such individuals account balances (including loans to the extent permitted
by Parents 401(k) plan), if elected by any such individuals.

 

(f) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Seller will
request that the trustee(s) or other applicable named fiduciary of the ESOP
(the " _ESOP Trustee_ ") take all necessary actions required by the ESOP plan
documents and applicable law, including, but not limited to, Section 409(e)(2)
of the Code, to conduct a pass-through vote of the ESOP participants to
direct the ESOP Trustee to vote the shares of stock owned by the ESOP either
in favor or against the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_ESOP Vote_ "). Sellers will further request that the ESOP Trustee provide to
Parent for its review and comment, reasonably in advance of the ESOP Vote, but
in any event within the fifteen (15) business days after the initial filing of
the S-4, all materials (including the information statement and any similar
disclosure materials, frequently asked questions and meeting slides and/or
handouts, but excluding the Proxy Statement) proposed to be disclosed to the
ESOP participants in connection with the ESOP Vote. Sellers will consider in
good faith, and request the ESOP Trustee to so consider, any and all comments
provided by Parent as to the content, scope and suitability of the materials
proposed to be disclosed.

 

(g) Seller shall take all actions necessary to terminate the ESOP, effective
no later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time. The accounts
of all participants and beneficiaries in the ESOP as of the Effective Time
shall become fully vested upon termination of the ESOP. At least three (3)
days prior to the Effective Time, all outstanding indebtedness of the ESOP
shall be repaid by delivering a sufficient number of unallocated shares of
Seller Common Stock to Seller. At the Effective Time, any remaining shares of
Seller Common Stock held by the ESOP Trust shall be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, and the balance of the unallocated
shares and any other unallocated assets remaining in the ESOP Trust after
repayment of the ESOP loan shall be allocated as earnings to the accounts of
the ESOP participants who are employed as of the date of termination of the
ESOP based on their account balances under the ESOP as of the date of
termination of the ESOP. Account balances will be distributed to ESOP
participants after the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the
IRS, unless otherwise required by law. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller
shall take all such actions as are necessary (determined in consultation with
Parent) to submit the application for favorable determination letter in
advance of the Effective Time, and following the Effective Time, Parent shall
use its best efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable determination
letter as promptly as possible (including, but not limited to, making such
changes to the ESOP as may be required by the IRS as a condition to its
issuance of a favorable determination letter). Prior to the Effective time,
Seller will adopt all amendments to the ESOP necessary or desirable to effect
the provisions of this Section 6.6(g). If any further amendments to the ESOP
are necessary or desirable to give effect to this Section 6.6(g), Parent shall
adopt such amendments. Promptly following the

 



59  receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the
qualified status of the ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in the
ESOP shall either be distributed to participants and beneficiaries or
transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual
retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall continue to accrue and make
contributions to the ESOP trust from the date of this Agreement through the
termination date of the ESOP in an amount sufficient (but not to exceed) the
loan payments which become due in the ordinary course on the outstanding
loans to the ESOP prior to the termination of the ESOP and shall make a pro-
rated payment on the ESOP loan for the 2018 Plan Year through and including
the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the Closing, prior to
the termination of the ESOP.

(h) Seller shall take all actions as are necessary, including the adoption of
Board of Directors or compensation committee resolutions or consents, to
terminate any or all of Sellers welfare benefit plans (e.g. medical, long-
term disability, and life insurance plans), effective no later than the day
immediately prior to the Effective Time, with such termination to be subject
to the occurrence of the Effective Time, except for the post-retirement health
arrangements set forth in Section 6.6(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
Prior to taking any such action, Seller shall provide Parent with a copy of
such resolutions or consent in connection with such plan termination, and
shall consider any comments provided by Parent in good faith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any employees of Seller or its
Subsidiaries who become employees of Parent on or after the Effective Time
("Continuing Employees"), no coverage of any Continuing Employee or their
dependents shall terminate under any Seller welfare benefit plans prior to
the time such Continuing Employees or their dependents, as applicable, become
eligible to participate in the New Plans common to all employees of the Parent
and consequently no Continuing Employee shall experience a gap in health and
welfare coverage.

(i) All of the non-qualified deferred compensation to which either Seller
and/or Seller Bank is a party are identified on Section 3.11(e) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. All such arrangements have been fully funded by Seller
or fully accrued for on Sellers books and records as of the date of this
Agreement, except to the extent reflected in "Unfunded Benefit Analysis"
disclosed in Section 6.6(k) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The Seller
shall cause the Seller Bank to take any and all necessary actions to terminate
the non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements noted in Section 3.11(e)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule at or immediately prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. From and
after the Effective Time, such deferred compensation arrangements shall be
terminated without any further accruals or increased obligations or further
contributions by Parent, except as set forth in Section 6.6(i) of Seller
Disclosure Schedule. Distribution of benefits in connection with the
termination of the non-qualified deferred compensation plans identified in
Section 3.11(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule will be administered in
accordance with the terms of the respective plans and the process set forth in
Section 6.6(k) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

(j) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any
right to continue

 



60  in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, Seller, or any
Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any
way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Seller, Parent or any Subsidiary
or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify
any Seller Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any particular Seller Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of
Section 9.11, nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 

(k) In no event shall the expenses associated with the payments required of
Seller and Seller Bank under Sections 6.6(c) and 6.6(i) of this Agreement
exceed the liabilities currently reflected therefor on the financial
statements of Seller by more than $3,060,000, as detailed on Section 6.6(k) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, each present and former director and officer of Seller and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "
_Seller Inde_ _mnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective
Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such
person is or was a director or officer of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time
serving at the request of any such party as a director, officer, employee,
trustee or partner of another corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture,
employee benefit plan or other entity as set forth on Section 6.7(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters,
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred
by such Seller Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law; _provided_ that the Seller Indemnified Party to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Seller Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

 



61 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Seller
( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and
directors of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events
that occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); _provided, however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend in the aggregate pursuant to
this Section 6.7(b) more than 300% of the aggregate annual premiums paid as of
the date hereof by Seller for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if
such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap,
then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of
insurance that provide the maximum coverage available at an amount equal to
the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Seller, in consultation with,
but only upon the consent of Parent, may (and at the request of Parent,
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the
Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under Sellers existing directors and
officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in
the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for
an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap, which
policy Parent shall not cancel or terminate for any reason.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Seller Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) liquidate, dissolve,
or transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any
other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then, in each such case,
the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

(d) Following the Effective Time, the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and Seller under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated
or modified in a manner so as to adversely affect any Seller Indemnified Party
or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the
prior written consent of the affected Seller Indemnified Party.

6.8 _Termination of Agreements_.

 

Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, Parent and Seller will confer
in good faith in an effort to identify (i) any agreements of Seller or Seller
Bank that should be terminated as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) when and how those agreements should be terminated.
Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall allow a Seller Contract to
expire or be renewed without prior consultation with Parent.

 



62 6.9 _Advice of Changes_.

 

Parent and Seller shall each promptly advise the other party of any fact,
change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would
or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or
that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that any
failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to
constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition
set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a
breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each
case unless the underlying fact, change, event or circumstance would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2
or 7.3 to be satisfied.

 

6.10 _Board Members; Advisory Board_. __

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall increase by two the
number of members of its Board of Directors and shall appoint two (2) persons
determined mutually by Seller and Parent as members of the Parent Board of
Directors, and (ii) Parent Bank shall increase by three (3) the number of
members of the Parent Bank Board of Directors and elect three (3) persons
determined mutually by Seller and Parent as members of the Parent Bank Board
of Directors.

 

(b) Parent Bank will invite all directors of Seller Bank not identified in the
immediately preceding sentence to be members of a community advisory board,
which Parent Bank will maintain for at least two (2) years following the
Closing Date.

6.11  _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) From February 9, 2018, Seller has, and has caused its Representatives to,
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
From and after the date hereof, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and cause its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors
and representatives (collectively, " _Representative_ s") not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any
negotiations with any person concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to any person relating to, any Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 6.11(a), in the event that, after
the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Seller Vote, Seller
receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and
may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to,
furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data, participate
in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside legal
counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor)
that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably capable of
becoming, a

 



63  Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such actions would be more
likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law. Prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to this Section 6.11(b), Seller shall have provided such
information to Parent, and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with such third party on terms no less favorable to Seller than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Seller.

 

(c) Seller will promptly advise Parent orally, within one (1) business day,
and by writing, within three (3) business days, of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and
conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal), and will promptly (and in any event orally, within one
(1) business day, and by writing, within three (3) business days) advise
Parent of any related developments, discussions and negotiations, including
any amendments to, or revisions of, the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the
receipt of the Requisite Seller Vote, Seller may accept or approve a Superior
Proposal, cancel or delay the Seller Meeting, change or withdraw its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger and/or terminate this
Agreement (each such action an " _Exit Action_ "); _provided_ , that the
Sellers Board of Directors may not do any of the foregoing unless:



     | (i) | the Board of Directors of Seller has concluded in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel, and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor) that the Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to accept such
Superior Proposal would be more likely than not to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law, after taking into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement agreed to or proposed by Parent; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Seller shall have provided prior written notice to Parent
at least four (4) business days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking
any Exit Action, which notice shall advise Parent that the Seller has
received a Superior Proposal, and specifying the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the person or group
making the Superior Proposal); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | during the Notice Period, Seller shall negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and 
---|---|--- 
 



64 good faith (after consultation with Sellers financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that, after considering the results of such negotiations,
if any, and after giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications
offered or agreed to by Parent, if any, that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. 
---|---|--- 
 

(e) Other than pursuant to this Section 6.11, Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, agents,
advisors and representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, or other agreement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.

(f) As used in this Agreement:

 



     | (i) | " _Ac_ _quisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, or proposal relating
to, or any third party indication of interest in, (A) any acquisition or
purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of
Seller and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Seller or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Seller,
(B) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or
more of any class of equity or voting securities of Seller or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or
more of the consolidated assets of Seller, or (C) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange or other business combination involving Seller or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or
more of the consolidated assets of Seller. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal on
terms which the Seller Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with Sellers outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisors, and taking into account all the legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, including execution risk and
risks as to certainty and timing of consummation, the interests of Seller
Banks employees, suppliers, and customers, and the communities in which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are located would, if consummated, result
in a transaction that is more favorable to the holders of Seller Common Stock
than the terms of this Agreement (in each case, taking into account any
revisions to this Agreement made or proposed by Parent); _provided_ that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "25% or
more" in the 

---|---|--- 
 



65 shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more." 
---|--- 
 

6.12 _Public Announcements_.

 

Seller and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts (a) to develop
a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that all press releases and other
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (c) except in respect
of any announcement required by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a
request by a Governmental Entity or (iii) an obligation pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, Seller and Parent
agree to consult with each other and to obtain the advance approval of the
other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical,
otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

6.13 _Change of Method_.

 

Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger and the Bank
Merger (including by providing for the merger of Parent Bank with and into
Seller Bank) if and to the extent requested by Parent, and Seller agrees to
enter into such amendments to this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement as
Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; 
_provided, however_ , that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this
Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect
to Sellers shareholders or causes the Merger to no longer qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (iii) be
reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be prevented or materially
delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented
or materially delayed, (iv) otherwise adversely affect the holders of Seller
Common Stock.

 

6.14 _Restructuring Efforts_.

 

Subject to Section 6.11, if Seller or Parent shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite Seller Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote at the duly convened
Seller Meeting or Parent Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction
provided for herein (provided, however, that no party shall have any
obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any material term of this
Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided
for in this Agreement or (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the
Merger with respect to Sellers shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this
Section 6.14) to its shareholders for adoption.

6.15 _Takeover Statutes_.

 

Neither Parent nor Seller shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Parent and Seller shall
take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any 

 



66  applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover
Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Parent and Seller will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability
of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.16 _Exemption_ _from Liability Under Section_ __ _ 16(b)_.

 

Parent shall take all steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the
transactions contemplated by Article I and Article II and any other
acquisitions of equity securities of Parent by any insiders of Seller in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.17 _Litigation_ _and Claims_.

 

Each of Parent and Seller shall promptly notify each other in writing of any
action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit,
subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or
before, or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent or Seller, as applicable, threatened against
Parent, Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or
would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the
Bank Merger Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby
or any actions taken or to be taken by Parent, Seller or their respective
Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Seller
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at its own expense in the
defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against Seller and/or its
directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Parents prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

6.18 _Disclosure Supplements_. 

From time to time until the Effective time, each of Parent and Seller will
promptly supplement or amend its respective Disclosure Schedule to disclose
anything that, if existing, occurring, or known on the date of this Agreement
would have been disclosed in that Disclosure Schedule, or to correct any
inaccurate information in that Disclosure Schedule. No supplement to
or amendment to such Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article
VII.

following conditions:

Seller or by the shareholders of Parent:

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and Seller in a written instrument;

(b) by either Parent or Seller if any Governmental Entity that must grant a
Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank
Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable, or any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable
order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or
making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger;

(c) by either Parent or Seller if the Merger shall not have been consummated
on or before December 31, 2018 (the " _Termina_ _tion Date_ "), unless the

the party seeking to terminate 

 



70  this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth herein;

 

(d) by Parent ( _provided_ , that Parent is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if
there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of
the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty
shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Seller,
which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate
with all other breaches by Seller (or failures of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2 and that is
not cured by the earlier of the Termination Date and the date that is thirty
(30) days following written notice to Seller, or by its nature or timing
cannot be cured during such period;

(e) by Seller ( _provided_ , that Seller is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if
there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of
the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty
shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Parent,
which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate
with all other breaches by Parent (or failures of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3 and that is
not cured by the earlier of the Termination Date and the date that is thirty
(30) days following written notice to Parent, or by its nature or timing
cannot be cured during such period;

(f) by Parent, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Seller Vote
is obtained, Seller or the Board of Directors of Seller (A) submits this
Agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or
otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or discloses its
intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its recommendation
as contemplated by Section 6.3(a), recommends to its shareholders an
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or Seller has accepted a Superior
Proposal, or (B) materially breaches its obligations under Section 6.3 or
6.11; or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the
outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock is commenced (other than by Parent
or a Parent Subsidiary), and the Board of Directors of Seller recommends that
the shareholders of Seller tender their shares in such tender or exchange
offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such
tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) business days of the date such
tender offer is first publicly commenced;

(g) by Seller pursuant to Section 6.11; or

 

(h) by Seller, if the Seller Board of Directors so determines by a vote of the
majority of the members of the entire Seller Board of Directors, at any time
during the five-day period (the " _Determination Period_ ") commencing with
the Determination Date (as defined below), if both of the following conditions
are satisfied:

 



71 Price by the Starting Price (each as defined below) (the " _Parent Ratio_ ")
shall be less than eighty one-hundredths (0.80); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | (x) the Parent Ratio shall be less than (y) the number
obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Starting Index Price (each
as defined below) and subtracting twenty one-hundredths (0.20) from the
quotient in this clause (ii)(y) (such number in this clause (ii)(y) being
referred to herein as the "Index Ratio"); subject, however, to the following
three sentences.  
---|---|--- 

If Seller elects to exercise the termination right pursuant to this Section
8.1(h), Seller shall give written notice to Parent (provided that such notice
of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the Determination
Period). During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such
notice, Parent shall have the option to increase the Merger Consideration to
be received by the holders of Seller Common Stock hereunder, by adjusting the
applicable Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-
thousandth (1/1000)) to equal the lesser of (x) a number (rounded to the
nearest one one-thousandth (1/1000)) obtained by dividing (A) the product of
the Starting Price, eighty one-hundredths (0.80) and the applicable Exchange
Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Average Closing Price and (y) a number
(rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth (1/1000)) obtained by dividing (A)
the product of the Index Ratio and the applicable Exchange Ratio (as then in
effect) by (B) the Parent Ratio. If Parent so elects within such five-day
period, it shall give prompt written notice to Seller of such election and the
revised applicable Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have
occurred pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) and this Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms (except as the applicable Exchange Ratio
shall have been so modified).

For purposes of this Section 8.1(h), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

Street Journal, or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source)
during the twenty (20) consecutive full trading days ending on the trading
day immediately prior to the Determination Date.

" _Determination Date_ " means the last to occur of (i) the date on which the

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or Seller
as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, and none of Parent, Seller, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any

and this Section 8.2 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii)

terminated by either Parent or Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the
Requisite Seller Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (y) prior to the date
that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Seller enters
into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to above), then Seller shall, on the earlier of the date it enters
into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to
Three-and-One-Half Million Dollars ($3,500,000) (the " _Termina_ _tion Fee_
"). 
---|---|--- 
 



73 Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or by Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(g),
then Seller shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, the
Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical after the date of
termination (and, in any event within three (3) business days thereafter). 
---|---|--- 
 

(c) Each of Parent and Seller acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Seller fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against Seller for
the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Seller shall pay the costs and
expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. The amounts payable by Seller pursuant to Section
8.2(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the
case of fraud or willful material misconduct, shall be the sole monetary
remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this Agreement as specified
in such section.

ARTICLE IX. GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

9.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_.

than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive in accordance with its
terms) shall survive the Effective Time, except for Sections 6.6, 6.7 and

therein that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part
after the Effective Time.

Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards

the shareholders of Seller and/or shareholders of Parent, there may not be,
without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement

be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of
conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically

The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles,
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words " _include_ ," "
_includes_ " or " _including_ " are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." References to " _the
date hereof_ " shall mean the date of this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the " _knowledge_ " of Seller or words of similar import mean the
actual knowledge of any of the officers of Seller listed on Section 9.6 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, and the " _knowledge_ " of Parent or words of
similar import mean the actual knowledge of any of the officers of Parent

 



76  listed on Section 9.6 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. As used herein, (i)
" _business day_ " means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on
which banks in Ohio or Indiana are authorized by law or executive order to be

(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental
Entity or other entity of any kind or nature, (iii) an " _affiliate_ " of a
specified person is any person that directly or indirectly controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with, such specified person and (iv)
the term " _made available_ " means any document or other information that was
(a) provided by one party or its representatives to the other party and its
representatives prior to the date hereof, (b) included in the virtual data
room of a party prior to the date hereof or (c) filed by a party with the SEC
and publicly available on EDGAR prior to the date hereof. The Seller
Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other
schedules and all exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and
included in any reference to this Agreement but may be omitted from filing as
part of any exhibit to the S-4 as permitted by SEC rules. All references to
"dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to United States dollars. This
Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to require any person to take
any action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would violate any
applicable law.

 

9.7 _Counterparts_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including by
facsimile or other electronic means as set forth in Section 9.14), all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need
not sign the same counterpart.

9.8 _Entire_ _Agreement_.

 

This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to
herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

 

9.9 _Governing_ _Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Ohio, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law.

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court of competent
jurisdiction located in Cleveland, Ohio (the " _Ch_ _osen Courts_ "), and,
solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection
to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii)
waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process
upon such party in any

 



77  such action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance
with Section 9.5.

 

9.10 _Waiver_ _of Jury Trial_.

 

Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy that may arise under
this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and
therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right such party may have
to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly
or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and
acknowledges that: (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver, (ii) each party understands and has considered the implications of
this waiver, (iii) each party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each
party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things,
the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.10.

 

9.11 _Assignment_ _;_ _Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
parties. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided
in (a) Section 6.7, which is intended to benefit each Seller Indemnified Party
and his or her heir and representatives, (b) Section 6.6(c), which is
intended to benefit, to the extent expressly provided therein, each employee
of Seller that is a party to an employment, change in control or other
severance agreement, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments
referred to herein) is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the
parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

9.12 _Specific_ _Performance_. 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, including

 



78  an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

9.13  _Severability_.

Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.

9.14  _Delivery_ _by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_.

This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in
connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or
thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
by e-mail delivery of a .pdf format data file or other image file, shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to
any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or
e-mail delivery of a .pdf format data file or other image file, to deliver a
signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a .pdf format data file
or other image file, as a defense to the formation of a contract and each
party hereto forever waives any such defense.

9.15  _Further_ ___Assurances_.

In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, any
merger between a Parent Subsidiary, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of
Seller, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to
all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any
of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party
to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

80 _EXHIBIT A_

 

FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT

 

 _ _ _ _, 2018

 

Civista Bancshares, Inc.

100 E. Water Street

 

Sandusky, Ohio 44870

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

Concurrently with the execution of this letter agreement (this " _Voting
Agreement_ "), Civista Bancshares, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Parent"),
Parents wholly-owned subsidiary, Civista Bank, a commercial bank chartered
under the laws of the State of Ohio ("Parent Bank"), United Community Bancorp,
an Indiana corporation ("Seller") and United Community Bank, a savings bank
chartered under the laws of the United States ("Seller Bank") are entering
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated the date of this Voting Agreement
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), whereby Seller will merge into Parent (the "
_Merger_ ") and shareholders of Seller will receive cash and Parent common
shares on terms stated in the Merger Agreement, subject to the closing of the
Merger. All capitalized terms used as defined terms but not defined in this
Voting Agreement have the meanings given in the Merger Agreement.

In order to induce Parent to execute and deliver the Merger Agreement to
Seller and Seller Bank and to proceed with the consummation of the Merger, the
undersigned (hereafter referred to as " _Shareholder_ ") is executing and
delivering this Voting Agreement to Parent. If more than one person executes
this Voting Agreement below as Shareholder, all references to "Shareholder"
shall mean all of those persons jointly and severally.

 

Shareholder, intending to be legally bound, agrees and represents as follows:

 

(a) As of the date of this Voting Agreement Shareholder has, and at all times
during the term of this Voting Agreement will have, beneficial ownership of,
and good and valid title to, shares of Seller Common Stock.
Shareholder also holds options or rights to acquire  shares of
Seller Common Stock. Except as disclosed in writing to Parent, all of
Shareholders shares of Seller Common Stock and options or rights to acquire
Seller common stock are owned free and clear of any proxy or voting
restriction, claims, liens, encumbrances, and security interests and any other
limitation or restriction whatsoever (including any restriction on the right
to dispose of the securities). None of Shareholders shares of Seller Common
Stock and options or rights to acquire Seller Common Stock are subject to a
voting trust or other agreement or arrangement regarding voting rights of the
securities. For purposes of this Voting Agreement beneficial ownership is
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Except for
(i) Seller Common Stock or options or rights to acquire Seller Common Stock,
(collectively, the " _Subject Securities_ "), in the amounts listed in
paragraph (a) above, as of the date of this Voting Agreement, Shareholder does
not beneficially own any (x) shares of a Seller 

 



EXHIBIT A-1  Common Stock, other equity securities, or voting securities of Seller, (y)
securities of Seller convertible into or exchangeable for Seller Common Stock,
other equity securities, or other voting securities of Seller or (z) options
or other rights to acquire from Seller any Seller Common Stock, other equity
securities, other voting securities, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Seller Common Stock, other equity securities, or other
voting securities of Seller. The Subject Securities enumerated in paragraph
(a), together with all Subject Securities Shareholder acquires during the term
of this Voting Agreement, including through exercise of options or rights,
are subject to the terms of this Voting Agreement.

(b) At the Seller Meeting, at which the Merger Agreement and the Merger will
be voted upon, and on every action or approval by written consent of
shareholders of Seller regarding the same, Shareholder will vote or cause to
be voted all shares of Seller Common Stock over which Shareholder has voting
power (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity of which Shareholder is
not the beneficial owner, if any) in favor of approval and adoption of the
Merger Agreement, the Merger, and other transactions under the Merger
Agreement and in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone the meeting to
a later date if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger
Agreement, the Merger, and other transactions under the Merger Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Voting Agreement requires, or
shall be deemed to require, Shareholder to exercise any options or rights to
acquire shares of Seller Common Stock held by Shareholder.

(c) During the term of this Voting Agreement, Shareholder will not
voluntarily, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, transfer, pledge, encumber,
or otherwise dispose of (collectively, " _Transfer_ ") any of Shareholders
Subject Securities (or interest therein), and Shareholder will use
Shareholders best efforts to not permit the Transfer of any of Shareholders
Subject Securities, except as may be permitted by paragraph (e).

 

(d) Shareholder has the legal capacity to enter into this Voting Agreement.
Shareholder has duly and validly executed and delivered this
Voting Agreement. This Voting Agreement is a valid and binding obligation
enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions. No consent of Shareholders spouse (if any) is
necessary under any community property or other law in order for Shareholder
to enter into and perform Shareholders obligations under this Voting
Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Shareholder may Transfer
any or all of Shareholders Subject Securities to Shareholders spouse,
children, or grandchildren; _provided, however_ , that in any such case, prior
to and as a condition to the effectiveness of the Transfer, the person to whom
Shareholder may Transfer the Subject Securities must execute and deliver to
Parent an agreement to be bound by the terms of this Voting Agreement and such
person must have the legal capacity to enter into such agreement. A transfer
not preceded by the transferees executed Voting Agreement delivered
to Parent is not valid or effective and will not be honored.

Shareholder is signing this Voting Agreement solely in Shareholders capacity
as a shareholder of Seller and as an option holder if Shareholder holds
options or rights to acquire shares of Seller Common Stock. Shareholder is not
signing this Voting Agreement in any other capacity, such as a director or
officer of Seller or as a fiduciary holding any Subject Securities in

 



EXHIBIT A-2  trust (unless Shareholder is the beneficial owner of such Subject
Securities). Shareholder makes no agreement in this Voting Agreement in any
capacity other than in Shareholders capacity as a beneficial owner of Seller
common shares and, options. Nothing in this Voting Agreement limits or affects
any action or inaction by Shareholder or any of Shareholders representatives,
as applicable, as a director or officer of Seller or affects the rights of
any director of Seller to exercise the directors fiduciary duties, in
connection with a Superior Proposal, pursuant to Sections 6.11 and 8.1(g) of
the Merger Agreement.

 

This Voting Agreement terminates and is of no further force and effect on the
earliest to occur of (a) the favorable vote of Seller shareholders for
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, (b) the
Effective Time, (c) Parent and Shareholder entering into a written agreement
to terminate this Voting Agreement, or (d) any termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, except that termination is without
prejudice to Parents rights if termination is a result of Shareholders
breach of any covenant or representation in this Voting Agreement.

 

All notices and other communications under this Voting Agreement must be in
writing and will be deemed given if delivered personally, sent by facsimile,
mailed by registered or certified mail return receipt requested, or delivered
by an express courier, to the other party at the addresses contained on the
signature page.

 

This Voting Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties. This Voting Agreement constitutes
the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties concerning the subject matter of
this Voting Agreement.

 

Shareholder agrees and acknowledges that Parent may be irreparably harmed by,
and that there is no adequate remedy at law for, a violation of this Voting
Agreement by Shareholder. Without limiting other remedies, Parent is entitled
to enforce this Voting Agreement by specific performance or injunctive relief.
This Voting Agreement and all claims arising hereunder or relating hereto
are governed by and will be construed and enforced in accordance with the
laws of the State of Ohio, without giving effect to the State of Ohio
principles of conflicts of law. Shareholder hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Ohio state court
or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Voting Agreement.

 

If a term, provision, covenant, or restriction of this Voting Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants, and restrictions of this Voting Agreement remain in full force and
effect and are not affected, impaired, or invalidated so long as the effect on
the economic or legal substance is not materially adverse to a party. If a
term, provision, covenant, or restriction of this Voting Agreement is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be invalid,
void, or unenforceable, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify
this Voting Agreement to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible.

 

This Voting Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by electronic
delivery and by facsimile and e-mail transmission of a scanned signature,
.pdf or image file) in one or

 



EXHIBIT A-3  more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed is deemed to be an original but all
of which taken together constitute a single instrument.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

Concurrently with the execution of this letter agreement (this " _Voting
Agreement_ "), Civista Bancshares, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Parent"),
Parents wholly-owned subsidiary, Civista Bank, a commercial bank chartered
under the laws of the State of Ohio ("Parent Bank"), United Community Bancorp,
an Indiana corporation ("Seller") and United Community Bank, a savings bank
chartered under the laws of the United States ("Seller Bank") are entering
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated the date of this Voting Agreement
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), whereby Seller will merge into Parent (the "
_Merger_ ") and shareholders of Seller will receive cash and Parent common
shares on terms stated in the Merger Agreement, subject to the closing of the
Merger. All capitalized terms used as defined terms but not defined in this
Voting Agreement have the meanings given in the Merger Agreement.

In order to induce Seller to execute and deliver the Merger Agreement to
Parent and to proceed with the consummation of the Merger, the undersigned
(hereafter referred to as " _Shareholder_ ") is executing and delivering this
Voting Agreement to Parent. If more than one person executes this Voting
Agreement below as Shareholder, all references to "Shareholder" shall mean all
of those persons jointly and severally.

 

Shareholder, intending to be legally bound, agrees and represents as follows:

 

(a) As of the date of this Voting Agreement Shareholder has, and at all times
during the term of this Voting Agreement will have, beneficial ownership of,
and good and valid title to, shares of Parent Common Stock.
Shareholder also holds options or rights to acquire  shares of
Parent Common Stock. Except as disclosed in writing to Seller, all of
Shareholders shares of Parent Common Stock and options or rights to acquire
Parent common stock are owned free and clear of any proxy or voting
restriction, claims, liens, encumbrances, and security interests and any other
limitation or restriction whatsoever (including any restriction on the right
to dispose of the securities). None of Shareholders shares of Parent Common
Stock and options or rights to acquire Parent Common Stock are subject to a
voting trust or other agreement or arrangement regarding voting rights of the
securities. For purposes of this Voting Agreement beneficial ownership is
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Except for
(i) Parent Common Stock or options or rights to acquire Parent Common
Stock, (collectively, the " _Subject Securities_ "), in the amounts listed in

 



EXHIBIT B-1  paragraph (a) above, as of the date of this Voting Agreement, Shareholder
does not beneficially own any (x) shares of a Parent Common Stock, other
equity securities, or voting securities of Parent, (y) securities of Parent
convertible into or exchangeable for Parent Common Stock, other equity
securities, or other voting securities of Seller or (z) options or other
rights to acquire from Parent any Parent Common Stock, other equity
securities, other voting securities, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Parent Common Stock, other equity securities, or other voting
securities of Parent. The Subject Securities enumerated in paragraph
(a), together with all Subject Securities Shareholder acquires during the
term of this Voting Agreement, including through exercise of options or
rights, are subject to the terms of this Voting Agreement.

 

(b) At the Parent Meeting, at which the Merger Agreement and the Merger will
be voted upon, and on every action or approval by written consent of
shareholders of Parent regarding the same, Shareholder will vote or cause to
be voted all shares of Parent Common Stock over which Shareholder has voting
power (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity of which Shareholder is
not the beneficial owner, if any) in favor of approval and adoption of the
Merger Agreement, the Merger, and other transactions under the Merger
Agreement and in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone the meeting to a
later date if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement,
the Merger, and other transactions under the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Voting Agreement requires, or shall be deemed
to require, Shareholder to exercise any options or rights to acquire shares
of Parent Common Stock held by Shareholder.

(c) During the term of this Voting Agreement, Shareholder will not
voluntarily, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, transfer, pledge, encumber,
or otherwise dispose of (collectively, " _Transfer_ ") any of Shareholders
Subject Securities (or interest therein), and Shareholder will
use Shareholders best efforts to not permit the Transfer of any of
Shareholders Subject Securities, except as may be permitted by paragraph (e).

 

(d) Shareholder has the legal capacity to enter into this Voting Agreement.
Shareholder has duly and validly executed and delivered this
Voting Agreement. This Voting Agreement is a valid and binding obligation
enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions. No consent of Shareholders spouse (if any) is
necessary under any community property or other law in order for Shareholder
to enter into and perform Shareholders obligations under this Voting
Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Shareholder may Transfer
any or all of Shareholders Subject Securities to Shareholders spouse,
children, or grandchildren; _provided, however_ , that in any such case, prior
to and as a condition to the effectiveness of the Transfer, the person to whom
Shareholder may Transfer the Subject Securities must execute and deliver to
Seller an agreement to be bound by the terms of this Voting Agreement and such
person must have the legal capacity to enter into such agreement. A transfer
not preceded by the transferees executed Voting Agreement delivered
to Seller is not valid or effective and will not be honored.

Shareholder is signing this Voting Agreement solely in Shareholders capacity
as a shareholder of Parent and as an option holder if Shareholder holds
options or rights to acquire

 



EXHIBIT B-2  shares of Parent Common Stock. Shareholder is not signing this Voting
Agreement in any other capacity, such as a director of Parent or as a
fiduciary holding any Subject Securities in trust (unless Shareholder is the
beneficial owner of such Subject Securities). Shareholder makes no agreement
in this Voting Agreement in any capacity other than in Shareholders capacity
as a beneficial owner of Parent common shares and, options. Nothing in this
Voting Agreement limits or affects any action or inaction by Shareholder or
any of Shareholders representatives, as applicable, as a director of Parent
or affects the rights of any director of Parent to exercise the directors
fiduciary duties.

This Voting Agreement terminates and is of no further force and effect on the
earliest to occur of (a) the favorable vote of Parent shareholders for
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, (b) the
Effective Time, (c) Seller and Shareholder entering into a written agreement
to terminate this Voting Agreement, or (d) any termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, except that termination is without
prejudice to Sellers rights if termination is a result of Shareholders
breach of any covenant or representation in this Voting Agreement.

All notices and other communications under this Voting Agreement must be in
writing and will be deemed given if delivered personally, sent by facsimile,
mailed by registered or certified mail return receipt requested, or delivered
by an express courier, to the other party at the addresses contained on the
signature page.

 

This Voting Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties. This Voting Agreement constitutes
the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties concerning the subject matter of
this Voting Agreement.

 

Shareholder agrees and acknowledges that Seller may be irreparably harmed by,
and that there is no adequate remedy at law for, a violation of this Voting
Agreement by Shareholder. Without limiting other remedies, Seller is entitled
to enforce this Voting Agreement by specific performance or injunctive relief.
This Voting Agreement and all claims arising hereunder or relating hereto
are governed by and will be construed and enforced in accordance with the
laws of the State of Ohio, without giving effect to the State of Ohio
principles of conflicts of law. Shareholder hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Ohio state court
or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Voting Agreement.

 

If a term, provision, covenant, or restriction of this Voting Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants, and restrictions of this Voting Agreement remain in full force and
effect and are not affected, impaired, or invalidated so long as the effect on
the economic or legal substance is not materially adverse to a party. If a
term, provision, covenant, or restriction of this Voting Agreement is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be invalid,
void, or unenforceable, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify
this Voting Agreement to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible.

 



EXHIBIT B-3 This Voting Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by electronic
delivery and by facsimile and e-mail transmission of a scanned signature,
.pdf or image file) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed is deemed to be
an original but all of which taken together constitute a single instrument.
