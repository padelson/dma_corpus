 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have each declared it to be advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and their respective stockholders that Parent acquire the Company in order to advance each of their long-term business interests; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have each approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the terms and conditions set forth herein, which Merger will result in, among other things, the Company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and the stockholders of the Company becoming stockholders of Parent; and 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of, and an inducement to, Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement certain holders of shares of the Companys common stock are entering into voting agreements in substantially the form of _Exhibit_ _A_ attached hereto and with such changes therein as are agreeable to Parent (the " _Voting Agreements_ "). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows. 

  

1\. THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _The Merger_. In accordance with the DGCL and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. From and after the 

   ##### 

  

 

Closing, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, shall continue its
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. The Company as the surviving corporation after the
Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving
Corporation_." 

   

 1.2 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 7, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in Section 6, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at a time and on a date to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which date shall be no later than the second Business Day (as defined below) after all the conditions set forth in Section 6 (excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived, unless another time and/or date is agreed to in writing by the Parties. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., 666 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10017, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the Parties. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day other than Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday on which banks are permitted to be closed in New York, New York. 

  

 1.3 _Filing of Certificate of Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Parties shall cause the Merger to become effective by causing the Surviving Corporation to execute and file in accordance with the DGCL a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon such filing, or at such later date and time as is agreed to by Parent and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. Upon the Closing, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in Section 259 of the DGCL. 

  

 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended to read in its entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit_ _B_ hereto, and, as so amended, until amended as provided therein and under the DGCL, it shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Surviving Corporation, and (b) the Bylaws of the Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Closing shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
amended as provided therein and under the DGCL and the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 1.6 _Directors and Officers_. Subject to the requirements of Law (as defined in Section 1.7(c)), the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Closing shall be the initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. 

  

 1.7 _Conversion of Company Common Stock, Etc_. 

  

 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or the holders of the following securities: 

  

 (a) Each share of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any shares of common stock subject to a repurchase right, but excluding Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares as each are defined below, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive (i) $15.00 per share in cash (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) 0.12275 fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of Parent, par $0.01 par value per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 1.11. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which previously represented any such share of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Certificate_ " and, collectively, the " _Company Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive cash and the shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1.7 together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 1.12 hereof, in each case without interest 

     ##### 

  

    

(such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock together with any cash in lieu
of fractional shares being referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_
") and subject to Section 1.7(c) below. 

   

 (b) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, any shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a person who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its rights to appraisal or it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. If, after the Closing, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal rights, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, regulation, legal requirement or rule, ordinance or code of any Governmental Authority (as such term is defined in Section 2.4(d) of this Agreement) (" _Law_ "). The Company shall not, except with prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, unless and to the extent required to do so under Law. 

   

 1.8 _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock either owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 2.2(e)) of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment therefor. 

  

 1.9 _Company Stock Options and Stock Purchase Plans_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, all unexercised options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") then outstanding under the stock option plans listed in Section 1.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (together, the 

     ##### 

  

    

" _Company Stock Option Plans_ "), other than the Company Stock Options
issued under the Companys 2001 Stock Plan (collectively, the " _2001 Plan
Options_ "), will be terminated or cancelled, as the case may be, in
accordance with the terms of such Company Stock Option Plans and the
agreements entered into under such Company Stock Option Plans. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall give any notice required by the Company
Stock Option Plans (other than the Companys 2001 Stock Plan), which notice
shall have been provided to Parent for its review prior to delivery, to
holders of Company Stock Options (other than 2001 Plan Options) of (i) the
acceleration in full of the vesting of such Company Stock Options, effective
as of a date determined by the Company on or prior to the date of the
Effective Time and (ii) the termination or cancellation, as the case may be,
upon the Closing of any unexercised Company Stock Options. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding 2001 Plan Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent and shall become an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Companys 2001 Stock Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined as follows: 

   

 (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each 2001 Plan Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such 2001 Plan Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and 

  

 (ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each 2001 Plan Option shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such 2001 Plan Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Option Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent. 

  

 (c) Any restriction on the exercise of any 2001 Plan Option assumed by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such 2001 Plan Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the 

     ##### 

  

    

assumption of such 2001 Plan Option, in each case except to the extent
otherwise provided in any stock option, change in control or in any retention
agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement. The "Option Conversion
Ratio" shall be equal to 0.491. 

   

 (d) Within five Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the participants in the Companys 2001 Stock Plan an appropriate notice setting forth such participants rights pursuant to the 2001 Plan Options, as provided in this Section 1.9. 

   

 (e) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the 2001 Plan Options assumed in accordance with this Section 1.9. Within two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such 2001 Plan Options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding. 

   

 (f) The Company and Parent shall each take all corporate and other action reasonably necessary to cause all dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including Company Stock Options) or acquisitions of equity securities of Parent (including any options to acquire Parent Common Stock that may be granted by Parent) by each individual who (i) is a director or officer of the Company or (ii) at the Effective Time will become a director or officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. 

   

 (g) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares under the Companys 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 5.5. 

   

 (h) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to a Repurchase Right or a Right of Repurchase (as such terms are defined in each applicable Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement or Stock Option Agreement, as the case may be, between such holder of Company Common Stock and the Company (each, a " _Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement_ ")) shall be automatically converted on the same basis as all other 

     ##### 

  

    

shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares cancelled pursuant to
Section 1.8 or which are Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 1.7),
except that the Merger Consideration issued in connection with such conversion
shall remain subject to a Repurchase Right in accordance with the terms set
forth in the applicable Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement. 

   

 1.10 _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. 

  

 Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, $0.01 par value per share (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted automatically into one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, $0.01 par value per share. From and after the Effective Time, each stock certificate of Merger Sub which previously represented shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of an equal number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.11 _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. 

  

 The Exchange Ratio and the Option Conversion Ratio (and, in the case of any of the matters described in this Section 1.11 with respect to Company Common Stock, the Per Share Cash Consideration) shall each be appropriately adjusted, at any time and from time to time, to fully reflect the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or, if permitted by the terms of Section 4.1, Company Common Stock, as the case may be, occurring (or for which a record date occurs) during the Interim Period (as defined in Section 4.1). 

  

 1.12 _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Company Certificates for exchange, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Company Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive from Parent, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such 

   #####

With respect to the Parent Identified Products that are not yet being marketed, to the knowledge of Parent, after the same are marketed, such marketing would not infringe any Parent Third Party Intellectual Property Rights, except for any infringement that would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (e) As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, no other Person is infringing, misappropriating or making any unlawful or unauthorized use of any Parent Intellectual Property Rights.

 4.2 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall, and shall direct its officers, directors, employees, auditors, attorneys and financial advisors and any other agents (each, a " _Representative_ ") to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or written communications (other than communications solely directed at informing other parties of the restrictions contained in this Section 4.2 and only in response to an inquiry from such other parties) with any party or parties that commenced prior to the execution of this Agreement with respect to any Competing Proposal. As used in this Agreement, a "Competing Proposal" means any proposal, offer or indication of interest (other than this Agreement and the Merger), whether in writing or otherwise, from any Person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliates thereof (a " _Third Party_ "), relating to (i) any acquisition or purchase, directly or indirectly, of more than 20% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or more than 20% of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company; (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Third Party beneficially owning more than 20% of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company; or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale of substantially all the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company. 

   

 (b) During the Interim Period, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries to (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or otherwise knowingly facilitate, directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to, any Competing Proposal; (ii) directly or indirectly initiate or participate in any discussions, negotiations or communications (other than communications solely directed at informing other parties of the restrictions contained in this Section 4.2 and only in response to an inquiry from such other parties) regarding any Competing Proposal; or (iii) furnish to any Third Party any nonpublic information or data for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, or, except as 

    ##### 

  

    

required by applicable Law, provide access to the properties, offices, books,
records, officers, directors or employees of the Company for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, any Competing Proposal. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of any of
the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.2 by any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach by the
Company of this Section 4.2 by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, prior to obtaining
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Companys Board of Directors
determines (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor)
that a Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach by the Company of
this Section 4.2 constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Competing Proposal (as such term is defined below), then the Company may, to
the extent that the Companys Board of Directors determines in good
faith after consultation with the Companys outside counsel that failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable
law and subject to the Companys providing prompt (but in any event within 48
hours) written notice to Parent of its decision to take such action
and compliance by the Company with Section 4.2(d), (A) furnish information or
data with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Third Party
(and the Representatives of such Third Party); (B) participate in discussions
and negotiations (including solicitations of a revised Competing Proposal by
such Third Party) directly or through its Representatives with such Third
Party, subject to, in the case of clause (A) and, to the extent such
discussions or negotiations include the disclosure by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their Representatives of any material nonpublic
information, clause (B), a confidentiality agreement not materially
less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that any such confidentiality agreement into which the Company may
enter pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall not be required to contain a
standstill provision if, prior to or substantially concurrently with
the execution of any such confidentiality agreement, the Company releases
Parent from its standstill obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement),
provided, that all such nonpublic information (other than any immaterial
information) not already provided or made available to the Parent is provided
to the Parent as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 48
hours) after it is provided to such Third Party; and (C) amend, or grant a
waiver or release under, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to
any Company Common Stock, but only to the extent necessary to permit the
making and subsequent consummation of a Competing Proposal by a Third Party.
For 

    ##### 

  

    

purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Competing Proposal" shall mean a bona
fide written proposal or offer made by a Third Party to acquire, directly or
indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, sale of
shares of stock, sale of assets, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, more
than 50% of the capital stock of the Company then outstanding or more than
50% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i)
on terms the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consulting the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor) are
more favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account, among
other things, relevant legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects
of the offer and the Third Party making the offer and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (ii) which is reasonably capable of being
consummated. 

   

 (c) Neither the Companys Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or publicly resolve to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub the Board Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose or publicly resolve to approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal; (iii) approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, or publicly propose or publicly resolve to approve or recommend, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or similar agreement relating to a Competing Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.2(b) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 4.2(b)) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "); (iv) approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, or publicly propose or publicly resolve to approve or recommend, any agreement requiring it to terminate this Agreement or abandon or fail to consummate the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby; or (v) take any action necessary to render the provisions of any "moratorium", "control share", "fair price", "affiliate transaction", "business combination", or other anti-takeover laws and regulations of any state or other jurisdiction, including the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, inapplicable to any Competing Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Companys Board of Directors may, in response to a Superior Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach by the Company of this Section 4.2, (1) withdraw or modify the Board 

    ##### 

  

    

Recommendation, (2) approve or recommend the Superior Competing Proposal or
(3) terminate the Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(h), but in the
case of any action contemplated by clause (1) or any recommendation
contemplated by clause (2), only (x) if the Companys Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable law, and in each case, only (y) at a
time that is after 48 hours following Parents receipt of written notice
advising Parent that the Companys Board of Directors is prepared to take
such action (during which period the Company shall make its chief financial
officer and its counsel available to Parent to meet on at least two separate
occasions for a total of at least 12 hours, and shall consider in good
faith any amendment of the terms of the Merger proposed by Parent or Merger
Sub or any proposal by Parent or Merger Sub to amend the terms of this
Agreement or the Merger), specifying therein the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Competing Proposal and identifying the Person or
group making such Superior Competing Proposal, and (z) if, after the end of
such 48-hour period, the Companys Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) that such proposed transaction continues to be a
Superior Competing Proposal, after taking into account any bona fide proposal
by Parent or Merger Sub to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Merger,
which proposal shall be binding during such 48-hour period and capable of
acceptance by the Company. The Company shall not during the term of this
Agreement release any Third Party from, or agree to amend or waive any
provision of, any confidentiality agreement with any Third Party with respect
to a Competing Proposal entered into pursuant to this Section 4.2 other than
the standstill provision as provided above, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
each confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this Section 4.2. In
addition, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Companys Board of Directors may withdraw or modify the Board Recommendation
if the Companys Board of Directors determines, after consultation with
outside counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable law, but only at a time that is after
48 hours (or such shorter period as the Companys Board of Directors may
determine in good faith is required to comply with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law) following Parents receipt of written
notice advising Parent 

    ##### 

  

    

that the Companys Board of Directors is prepared to take such action,
specifying the reasons therefore. 

   

 (d) In addition to the obligations set forth in Sections 4.2(a), (b) and (c), the Company shall notify Parent orally and, if requested by Parent, in writing, within 48 hours of the receipt by the Company of any Competing Proposal, which notification shall include the material terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal and the identity of the person or group making or sending the Competing Proposal. The Company shall promptly (but in any event within 48 hours) advise Parent of any material change in the terms or conditions of a Competing Proposal or any other material development with respect thereto. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 4.2 or any other provision hereof shall prohibit the Company or the Companys Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders, if the Companys Board of Directors determines, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. 

   

 (f) Nothing in this Section 4.2 shall permit the Company to terminate this Agreement (except as expressly provided in Section 7).

    ##### 

  

    

Interim Period, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company and Parent agree to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to promptly consummate and make effective the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using their respective reasonable best efforts: (i) to obtain prior to the Closing Date all licenses, certificates, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company or its Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) to effect all necessary registrations and filings required by any Governmental Authority (in connection with which Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such registrations and filings, including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to the time of such filing and, if requested, will consider in good faith reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith); and

 (c) Each of Parent and the Company (i) shall as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof, make the filings required of such party or any Subsidiary under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate with the United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice and/or any other Governmental Authority in respect of such filings to prevent the issuance of any requests for additional information, documents or other materials under the HSR Act; and (iii) shall act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any such filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Authority under any antitrust Law (" _Antitrust Laws_ ") with respect to any such filing or any such transaction.

Each of the Company and Parent shall give the other reasonably prompt notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such transaction. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other prior notice (if practicable) of the meeting and discussing with Parent or the Company, as the case may be, the advisability of Parents or the Companys representatives, as the case may be, participating in such meeting or conversation. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Parent has advised the Company that Parent intends to seek financing of a portion of the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration (" _Financing_ "). The Parties agree that 

    ##### 

  

    

such Financing is not a condition to any Partys obligation to effect the
Merger and consummate the other transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with this Agreement, and that Parent and Merger Sub shall be
required to proceed with the Closing notwithstanding Parents inability or
failure to obtain such Financing. The Company agrees that it will use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with Parents
preparation of offering materials in connection with the Financing (provided
that the Company shall not be required to assume any liability therefor).
Subject to consent by the Companys independent accountants, Parent may
use the Companys financial statements in connection with the Financing. In
connection therewith, in each case at Parents expense, the Company shall (i)
provide any source of Financing with access to the Companys books and
records and provide such party with such other information
reasonably requested for purposes of verifying the Companys financial
statements (subject to a confidentiality undertaking reasonably acceptable to
the Company, and upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in
a manner that does not disrupt or interfere with the Companys business
operations) and (ii) do such other acts and things, as shall be reasonably
requested by Parent or any source of Financing in connection with the same.
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director, officer or Representative of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to the
Financing this Section 5.4. 

   

 5.5 _Termination of ESPP_. The Company shall take actions as are necessary to cause the Exercise Date (as such term is used in the ESPP) applicable to the then current Offering Period (as such term is used in the ESPP) to be the last Business Day on which the Company Common Stock is quoted on the NNM immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Final Company Purchase Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that such change in the Exercise Date shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. On the Final Company Purchase Date the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP within each participants payroll withholdings account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Any such shares purchased under the ESPP shall be automatically 

   ##### 

  

 

converted on the same basis as all other shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares), except that, with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock constituting a portion of the Merger
Consideration, such shares shall be converted automatically into shares of
Parent Common Stock without issuance of certificates representing issued
and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to ESPP participants. 

   

 5.6 _Employee Benefits_. Within a reasonable period of time prior to the Effective Time, so as to facilitate a transfer of Company employees who are employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries upon and after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") to the employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries ("Parent Plans" or "Parent Policy"), the Company shall terminate all Company Employee Plans which are cash or deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Code. In addition, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement and except for any Company Employee Plans providing group medical, dental or vision benefits and any Company Employee Plans covered by Section 125 of the Code (including any attendant health or dependent care flexible spending account arrangements), the Company shall terminate all Company Employee Plans as of the Effective Time. With respect to any Company Employee Plans providing group medical, dental or vision benefits and any Company Employee Plans covered by Section 125 of the Code (including any attendant health or dependent care flexible spending account arrangements), such plans shall continue to be maintained upon and after Effective Time ("Continuing Plans") in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Continuing Plans until the end of the applicable Continuing Plan year in which the Effective Time occurs at which time the Surviving Corporation shall terminate such Continuing Plans and Parent shall allow for the participation of former Continuing Plan participants in comparable Parent Plans under the terms and conditions of such comparable Parent Plans to the extent such participants remain employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries and who are otherwise eligible for participation in such comparable Parent Plans. Following the Effective Time, Parent will give each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of (a) eligibility, vesting and retirement status (but not benefit accruals) under any comparable Parent Plans and (b) determination of benefit levels under any comparable Parent Plan or Parent Policy relating to vacation or severance. Parent shall make Continuing Employees eligible for 

   ##### 

  

 

participation in a 401(k) Plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation immediately upon the Effective Time, which shall be comparable to
the 401(k) Plan maintained by Parent, and allow Continuing Employees to roll
over their applicable Company 401(k) Plan accounts at the discretion of
Continuing Employees to such 401(k) Plan maintained by Parent or
Surviving Corporation provided such rollovers do not adversely affect the
tax-qualified status of such 401(k) plan. In addition, Parent shall waive, or
cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent
such limitations are waived under any comparable Parent Plan except to the
extent a similar limitation or pre-existing condition limitation existed under
the comparable Company Employee Plan. Parent shall give Continuing Employees
credit towards any lifetime deductibles or limitations on out of pocket
expenses to the extent a Continuing Employee incurred the same with respect
to a Company Employee Plan and such deductibles or limitations are applicable
under the comparable Parent Plan. Parent shall take all reasonable actions
to effectuate the terms and conditions of this Section 5.6 including, without
limitation, amending or causing to be amended the comparable Parent Plans. 

   

 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon becoming aware of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur would reasonably be expected to result in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate such that the condition in Section 6.2(a) or 6.3(a) would not be satisfied and (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder such that the condition in Section 6.2(b) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice. 

  

 5.8 _Public Announcements_. 

  

 Except as otherwise required by Law or the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, or as provided elsewhere herein, prior to the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent and (b) Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other before

issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement. 

   

 5.9 _Accountant s Letters_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a "comfort" letter of Ernst and Young dated within two (2) Business Days before the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and addressed to Parent and the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent. 

   

 (b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company a "comfort" letter of KPMG, dated a date within two (2) Business Days before the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and addressed to the Company and Parent, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company. 

   

 5.10 _Directors and Officers Insurance/Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) The Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase a six (6) year extended reporting period endorsement (" _reporting tail coverage_ ") with respect to the Companys directors and officers liability insurance currently in effect, and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term, provided that Parent shall not be required to pay more than 275% of the aggregate premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the year ended December 31, 2004 for such reporting tail coverage, provided, further, should the cost of reporting tail coverage exceed such cap, Parent shall instead purchase the maximum reporting tail coverage available for 275% of the aggregate premium paid by the Company and its subsidiaries in the year ended December 31, 2004. Parent may also request that Company purchase the forgoing coverage on Parents behalf prior to the Effective Time and Company shall cooperate with Parent in doing so. 

   

 (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, with respect to claims or events existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all 

    ##### 

  

    

claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or by reason
of the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL
for officers and directors of Delaware corporations. 

   

 (c) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company. 

   

 (d) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 5.10 in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 5.10. 

   

 (e) The provisions of this Section are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company by Law, charter, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. 

   

 5.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. 

  

 The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any stockholder litigation brought, or threatened in writing, against the Company and/or the members of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall provide Parent with updates and such information as Parent shall reasonably request with respect to the status of the litigation and discussion between the parties thereto. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of and settlement discussions with respect to (but, in each case, not control) such litigation and the Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such litigation unless Parent shall 

   #####

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 5.14 _Certain Parent Agreements_. Without the prior written agreement of Company, which written agreement shall, in the case of clause (e) below, not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned, Parent agrees not to, prior to Closing, (a) amend Parents Certificate of Incorporation in any way adverse to the interests of the stockholders of the Company (including the holders of Company Common Stock who are issued Parent Common Stock in the Merger), (b) amend Merger Subs Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; (c) engage in any repurchase at a premium, recapitalization, restructuring or reorganization with respect to any of Parents capital stock; (d) declare, set aside or pay any extraordinary dividend or other extraordinary distribution (whether in cash, stock or other securities or property, or any combination thereof) in respect of any of Parents capital stock other than pursuant to Parents Shareholder Rights Plan, adopted September 27, 2000, any amendment thereto, or the adoption of a replacement shareholder rights plan (other than such a replacement plan that would treat the holders of Company Common Stock, as a class, differently than the holders of Parent Common Stock); or (e) acquire (by merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise) a significant portion of the capital stock or other equity interests in, or assets of, any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture or other business organization or division thereof, or enter into any definitive agreement with respect thereto, unless such acquisition or the entering into of such definitive agreement (I) would not require any vote of Parents stockholders or 

   ##### 

  

 

require that any pro forma or other additional financial statements or
information be added to the Registration Statement, and (II) would not
reasonably be expected to (A) impose any material delay in the obtaining of,
or increase in any material respect the risk of not obtaining,
any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Merger, (B) increase in
any material respect the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or (C) increase in any material respect the
risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise. 

   

 5.15 _Affiliates_.

 5.16 _Consultation_. 

  

 In addition to any other requirements set forth herein with respect to the following, the Company agrees, during the Interim Period, to consult with Parent prior to (i) hiring any unbudgeted employees or (ii) entering into any agreement, or amending or waiving the terms of any existing agreement, which grants to any Person supply, manufacturing, warehousing, production, marketing or distribution rights with respect to any of its products or technologies or entering into any material collaboration agreement, material license, co-marketing or copromotion agreement or any other such material agreement with respect to the Companys Intellectual Property Rights.

The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without 

    ##### 

 

   

limitation." The word "herein" and similar references mean, except where a
specific Section or Section reference is expressly indicated, the entire
Agreement rather than any specific Section or Section. The table of contents
and the headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. References in this Agreement to a contract or agreement mean such
contract or agreement as amended or otherwise modified from time to time.
References in this Agreement to a law include any rules, regulations and

 8.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

This Agreement (including all exhibits and schedules hereto), and other documents and instruments delivered in connection herewith constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings (other than the Confidentiality Agreement), both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 8.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that Merger Sub may assign all or any of its rights hereunder to another wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, provided that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement. 

  

 8.8 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. 

  

 8.9 _Governing Law; Enforcement_. This Agreement and the rights and duties of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of Delaware. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the Parties: (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County in the State of Delaware (or, if such court lacks jurisdiction, any appropriate state or federal court in New Castle County in the State of Delaware), in the event of any dispute related to or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby; (b) agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding related to or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby except in such courts; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby; and (e) consents to service of process by delivery pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof.

EXHIBIT A 
 VOTING AGREEMENT 

    ##### 

  

     

VOTING AGREEMENT 

   

 VOTING AGREEMENT, dated as of August ___, 2005 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and between OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and ___ (" _Stockholder_ "). Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement (as defined below). 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, Parent, Merger EP Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which (and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein), Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), and each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration; 

  

 WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Stockholder beneficially owns ___shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Owned Shares_ " and, together with any shares of Company Common Stock of which Stockholder acquires beneficial ownership after the date hereof and prior to the termination hereof, whether upon exercise of options, warrants, conversion of other convertible securities or otherwise, collectively referred to herein as, the " _Covered Shares_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Stockholder acknowledges that Parent is relying on the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements of Stockholder set forth in this Agreement in order to induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement and proceed with the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent and Stockholder hereby agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Agreement to Vote_. 

  

 (a) Prior to any termination of this Agreement, Stockholder hereby agrees that it shall, and shall cause any other holder of record of any Covered Shares to, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or 

  ##### 

  

    

postponed meeting), however called, (i) when a meeting is held, appear at such
meeting, submit a proxy to vote the Covered Shares at such meeting or
otherwise cause the Covered Shares to be counted as present thereat for the
purpose of establishing a quorum, (ii) vote (or caused to be voted) in person
or by proxy all Covered Shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and any other matters necessary for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as the Merger Agreement
may be modified or amended from time to time in a manner not adverse to
Stockholder, and (iii) vote (or cause to be voted) all Covered Shares against
any Competing Proposal. 

   

 (b) STOCKHOLDER HEREBY GRANTS TO, AND APPOINTS, PARENT, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF PARENT AND THE SECRETARY OF PARENT, IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CAPACITIES AS OFFICERS OF PARENT, AND ANY OTHER DESIGNEE OF PARENT, EACH OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY, THE STOCKHOLDERS IRREVOCABLE PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT (WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION) TO VOTE THE COVERED SHARES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN CLAUSE (a) OF THIS _SECTION 1_ , _PROVIDED_ ,  _HOWEVER_ , THAT THE PROXY GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS CLAUSE (b) SHALL IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE AND HAVE NO FURTHER FORCE AND EFFECT UPON THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. STOCKHOLDER INTENDS THIS PROXY TO BE IRREVOCABLE DURING THE TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT AND COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST. STOCKHOLDER WILL TAKE SUCH FURTHER ACTION OR EXECUTE SUCH OTHER INSTRUMENTS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS PROXY AND HEREBY REVOKES ANY PROXY PREVIOUSLY GRANTED BY STOCKHOLDER WITH RESPECT TO THE COVERED SHARES TO THE EXTENT INCONSISTENT WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth in clause (a) of this _Section 1_, Stockholder shall not be restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall give Parent or any of its officers or designees the right to vote any Covered Shares in connection with the election of directors. 

    ##### 

  

     

 2. _No Inconsistent Agreements_. Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that, except as contemplated by this Agreement, it (a) has not entered into, and shall not enter at any time while this Agreement remains in effect, any voting agreement or voting trust with respect to the Covered Shares and (b) has not granted, and shall not grant at any time while this Agreement remains in effect, a proxy or power of attorney with respect to the Covered Shares, in either case, which is inconsistent with its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 3. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest of (a) the Effective Time, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (c) written notice of termination of this Agreement by Parent to Stockholder, such earliest date being referred to herein as the "Termination Date". 

  

 4. _Representations and Warranties_. 

  

 (a) Representations and Warranties of Parent. Parent hereby represents and warrants to Stockholder as follows: 

   

 (i) _Valid Existence_. Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. 

  

 (ii) _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. Parent has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Stockholder, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (iii) _No Conflicts_. Except for the applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"), no filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is necessary on the part of Parent for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and the consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Representations and Warranties of Stockholder._ Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows: 

   

 (i) _Ownership of Securities_. As of the date of this Agreement, (A) Stockholder beneficially owns the Owned Shares, (B) Stockholder is the sole record holder (or, in the case of shares held in street name, beneficial owner) of ___Shares of Common Stock (all of which shares are included in the Owned Shares), free and clear of Liens (other than Liens for Taxes not yet due or payable, Liens created by this Agreement or in connection with the arrangements set forth on Schedule I attached to this Agreement), (C) Stockholder has sole voting power and sole power of disposition with respect to all Owned Shares, with no restrictions (other than those created by this Agreement or in connection with the arrangements set forth on Schedule I attached to this Agreement), subject to applicable federal securities laws on their rights of disposition pertaining thereto, and (D) Stockholder beneficially owns ___shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of currently exercisable stock options (collectively, the " _Stock Options_ "). Other than as created by this Agreement, Stockholder has not appointed or granted any proxy which is still in effect with respect to the Owned Shares. As used in this Agreement, the terms " _beneficial owner_ ", " _beneficial ownership_ ", " _beneficially owns_ " or " _owns beneficially_ ", with respect to any securities, refer to the beneficial ownership of such securities as determined under Rule 13d-3(a) of the Exchange Act. 

  

 (ii) _Existence, Power; Binding Agreement_. If Stockholder is an entity, Stockholder is duly organized, formed or created, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and all necessary corporate or other entity action on behalf of Stockholder has been taken to authorize this Agreement to be entered into on behalf of and to be performed by Stockholder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Stockholder and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equitable Exceptions. If Stockholder is married, and any of the Covered Shares constitute community property or otherwise need spousal or other approval for this Agreement to be legal, valid and binding, this Agreement has 

   ##### 

  

    

been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of, Stockholders spouse, enforceable against
such Stockholders spouse in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equitable Exceptions. 

  

 (iii) _No Conflicts_. Except for the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (A) no filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any state, federal or foreign governmental authority is necessary on the part of Stockholder for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder and the consummation by Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder, the consummation by Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by Stockholder with any of the provisions hereof will (1) result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any Covered Shares pursuant to, any contract to which Stockholder is a party or by which Stockholder or any property or asset of Stockholder is bound or affected or (2) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Stockholder or any of its properties or assets, except in the case of (2) for violations, breaches or defaults that would not in the aggregate materially impair the ability of Stockholder to perform its obligations hereunder. 

  

 5. _Certain Covenants._ Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees as follows: 

  

 (a) _No Solicitation._ Stockholder agrees that (i) he or it is a "Representative" of the Company for purposes of Section 4.2 of the Merger Agreement, (ii) in such capacity, he or it is subject to the restrictions of Section 4.2 of the Merger Agreement and (iii) that any breach by Stockholder of the terms of Section 4.2 of the Merger Agreement shall be a breach by Stockholder of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Restriction on Transfer, Proxies and Non-Interference._ Except in connection with the arrangements set forth on Schedule I attached to this Agreement, Stockholder hereby agrees, while this Agreement is in effect, and except as contemplated hereby, not to (i) sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, 

  ##### 

  

    

encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of, any of the Owned Shares or
Stock Options (other than the exercise of Stock Options), (ii) grant any
proxies or powers of attorney, deposit any Owned Shares into a voting trust
or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any Owned Shares or (iii)
knowingly take any action that would make any representation or warranty
of Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect
or have the effect of preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing its
obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the restrictions and
prohibitions on the trading of Owned Shares or Stock Options set forth in
this Section 5(b) and elsewhere in this Agreement, Stockholder shall be
permitted to effect transactions with respect to Owned Shares and Stock
Options pursuant to, and permitted under, approved trading plans established
under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act (" _Trading Plans_ "),
provided that such Trading Plans shall be in place on or prior to the date of
this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Additional Shares._ Stockholder agrees, while this Agreement is in effect, to promptly notify Parent of the number of any new shares of which Stockholder acquires beneficial ownership after the date hereof (including upon the exercise of Stock Options).

 7. _Fiduciary Duties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (a) Stockholder makes no agreement or understanding herein in any capacity other than in Stockholders capacity as a holder of Covered Shares, (b) if Stockholder is a director or officer of the Company, nothing herein shall be construed to limit or affect any action or inaction by Stockholder acting in such persons capacity as an officer or director of the Company and in compliance with Section 4.2 of the Merger Agreement, (c) Stockholder may provide information and engage in discussions with a Third Party, as and to the extent that the Company is permitted to do so, if, after the Company shall have received a Competing Proposal from such Third Party, the Companys Board of Directors has complied with the provisions of Section 4.2 of the Merger Agreement, and (d) Stockholder shall have no liability to Parent or any of its affiliates under this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement or otherwise as a result of any action or inaction by Stockholder in
such persons capacity as a director of the Company and in compliance with
Section 4.2 of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 8. _No Control_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent the right to control or direct the Company or the Companys operations. 

  

 9. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. 

  

 10. _Non-survival of Representations and Warranties_. The respective representations and warranties of Stockholder and Parent contained herein shall not survive the Termination Date. 

  

 11. _Notices_. All notices or other communications which are required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and sufficient if delivered personally or sent by nationally-recognized overnight courier or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or by electronic mail, with a copy thereof to be delivered by mail (as aforesaid) within 24 hours of such electronic mail, or by telecopier, with a copy thereof to be delivered by mail (as aforesaid) within 24 hours of such telecopy, in each case addressed as follows:

MANAGEMENT

    

 For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and in further definition and not in limitation of the powers of the Corporation and of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, conferred by the State of Delaware, it is further provided that: 

   ##### 

  

  

 A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation shall be vested in its board of directors (the " _Board of Directors_ "). The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the Corporations By-Laws (the " _By-laws_ ").

 D. The books of the Corporation may be kept at such place within or without the State of Delaware as the By-Laws may provide or as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. 

  

ARTICLE VII 

  

INDEMNIFICATION

    

 The Corporation shall provide indemnification as follows: 

  

 1. _Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of
the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or
in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such
persons being referred to hereafter as an " _Indemnitee_ "), or by reason
of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against
all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom,
if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon
a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
unlawful. 

  

 2. _Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made under this Section 2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of Chancery of Delaware 

   ##### 

  

    

shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including
attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware shall deem proper. 

  

 3. _Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article VII, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto. 

  

 4. _Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to an Indemnitees right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in this Section 4\. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the 

   ##### 

  

    

Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense
of Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been
authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to Indemnitee shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on
any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of
the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (iii) the
Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of
such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in each of which cases the
fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the
Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article VII. The
Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to
assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation
or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the
conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation shall not be
required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article VII for any amounts paid
in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation effected
without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any action,
suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any penalty
or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitees written consent. Neither the
Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to
any proposed settlement. 

  

 5. _Advance of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article VII, in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article VII of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Article VII, any expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VII; and further provided that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under this Article VII if it is determined (in the manner described in Section 6) that (i) Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee 

   ##### 

  

    

had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Such undertaking
shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to
make such repayment. 

  

 6. _Procedure for Indemnification_. In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article VII, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 30 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, unless the Corporation determines within such 30-day period that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1, 2 or 5 of this Article VII, as the case may be. Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to requests under Section 1 or 2 only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the Corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (" _disinterested directors_ "), whether or not a quorum, (b) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation. 

  

 7. _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article VII shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 of this Article VII that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing Indemnitees right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8. _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VII, except as set forth in Section 7 of this Article VII, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VII in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VII, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 8 shall be construed to require any Indemnitee to seek reimbursement under any insurance policy. 

  

 9. _Subsequent Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article VII or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal. 

  

 10. _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitees official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article VII shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article VII. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other 

   ##### 

  

    

persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or
greater or less than, those set forth in this Article VII. 

  

 11. _Partial Indemnification_. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article VII to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled. 

  

 12. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of Delaware. 

  

 13. _Savings Clause_. If this Article VII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VII that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 

  

 14. _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section 145(i) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i). 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE VIII 

  

RIGHT TO AMEND CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

    

 From time to time any of the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed, and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon the stockholders of the Corporation by this Certificate of Incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of this Article VIII. 

   ##### 

  

  

EXHIBIT C 

  

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

    

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as Exchange Agent in the Merger. 

  

 (b) _Parent to Provide Merger Consideration_. Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for exchange through the procedures set forth herein, sufficient cash and shares of Parent Common Stock to be exchanged pursuant to Section 1.7 of the Agreement plus cash for fractional shares. 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable, after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a Company Certificate, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive as part of the Merger Consideration and (B) a check for the cash that such holder is entitled to receive, including any cash consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7, and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Company Certificate shall be deemed from and after the Closing, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section (b) above, which remains undistributed to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock for 12 months after the Closing shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore 

   ##### 

  

    

complied with this _Exhibit_ _C_ shall thereafter be entitled to receive
from Parent payment of the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock to which such holders may be then entitled. 

  

 (d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Closing with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Closing will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered shares of Company Common Stock with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, until the holder of record of such Company Certificate shall surrender such Company Certificate. Subject to Law, following surrender of any such Company Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of record of such Company Certificate representing the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the applicable cash consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Closing theretofore paid with respect to such whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock or check is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer, and that the stockholder requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent, or any agent designated by it, any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is otherwise not payable. 

  

 (f) _Withholding of Tax_. Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent (or any Affiliate, including the Surviving Corporation) or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct 

   ##### 

  

    

and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable
Governmental Authority and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by
Parent. 

  

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and an indemnification against loss in customary form, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

August ___, 2005 

  

OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

   

[ADDRESS]

    

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

   

 The undersigned, a holder of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), of Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), is entitled to receive, in connection with the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of the Company with and into Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ", which definition, for purposes hereof, shall also include any shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise acquired or beneficially owned by the undersigned prior to the Merger). The undersigned has been advised that, as of the date hereof, he or it may be deemed an " _affiliate_ " of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 (" _Rule 145_") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), although nothing contained herein should be construed as an admission of such fact, nor as a waiver of any right the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter. 

  

 If, in fact, the undersigned were such an affiliate under the Securities Act, the undersigneds ability to sell, assign or transfer the shares of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in the Merger may be restricted unless such transaction is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions are limited and, to the extent the undersigned felt or feels necessary, the undersigned has obtained or will obtain advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act. The undersigned understands that Parent is under no obligation to register Parent Common Stock for sale, transfer or other disposition by the undersigned or take any action (other than as provided in the penultimate 

   ##### 

  

    

paragraph of this letter) to make compliance with an exemption from
registration available to the undersigned. 

  

 The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that the undersigned will not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the SEC specifically issued with respect to a transaction to be engaged in by the undersigned, is not required to be registered under the Securities Act. 

  

 In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, the undersigned will supply Parent or Parents transfer agent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of a customary letter and, to the extent required by the preceding paragraph, the opinion of counsel or no-action letter referred to in such paragraph. The undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided such transfer is not prohibited by any other provision of this letter agreement) upon receipt of such evidence of compliance, Parent shall cause the transfer agent to effectuate, on a timely basis, the transfer of the Parent Common Stock sold as indicated in such letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall revoke the stop transfer instructions with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock held by the undersigned or a transferee of the undersigned as to which the legend referred to below has been removed. 

  

 The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that there will be placed on the certificates for Parent Common Stock issued to the undersigned in connection with Merger, or, except as otherwise provided herein, any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

   

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED
(THE " _ACT_ "), APPLIES, AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, EXCHANGED, PLEDGED, 

   ##### 

  

   

TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT, AND OTHER CONDITIONS SPECIFIED IN THE COMPANY
AFFILIATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN EYETECH PHRAMACEUTUCALS, INC. AND THE HOLDER OF
THIS CERTIFICATE, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE INSPECTED BY THE HOLDER OF THIS
CERTIFICATE AT THE OFFICES OF EYETECH PHRAMACEUTUCALS, INC. OR WHICH WILL BE
FURNISHED BY EYETECH PHRAMACEUTUCALS, INC. WITHOUT CHARGE, TO THE HOLDER OF
THIS CERTIFICATE UPON WRITTEN REQUEST." 

  

 It is understood and agreed that certificates with the legend set forth in the preceding paragraph will be replaced by delivery of certificates without such legend, and Parent will cause its transfer agent to promptly issue such a certificate without such legend, and the sale restrictions described in this letter agreement will cease to apply, if: 

   

(i) one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the
Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule
145(d)(2) are then available to the undersigned; 

   

(ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the
Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule
145(d)(3) are then applicable to the undersigned; 

   

(iii) Parent has received either an opinion of counsel, which opinion and
counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no action" letter
obtained by the undersigned from the staff of the SEC, to the effect that the
restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Securities Act no longer apply to
the undersigned; or 

   

(iv) any registration statement registering the resale of Parent Common Stock
issued to the undersigned is declared effective by the SEC or automatically
becomes effective. 

  

 For so long as and to the extent necessary to permit the undersigned to sell its shares of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144 under the Securities Act, Parent shall file, on a timely basis, all reports and data required to be filed with 

   ##### 

  

    

the SEC by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule
144 (or, if applicable, Parent shall make publicly available the information
regarding itself referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 144), furnish to the
undersigned upon request a written statement as to whether Parent
has complied with such reporting requirements during the twelve months
preceding any proposed sale under Rule 144 and Rule 145 and otherwise take
all such actions as reasonably available to permit such sales pursuant to
Rule 145 and Rule 144\. Parent has filed, on a timely basis, all
reports required to be filed with the SEC under Section 13 of the Exchange
Act during the preceding twelve months. 

  

 The undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned has carefully read this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock. 

  

Very truly yours,
