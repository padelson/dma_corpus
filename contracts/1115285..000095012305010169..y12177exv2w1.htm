imposing such liability. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or have any
effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect

as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit

any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including
attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal
therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed
to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or
upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in,
or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the
request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a
similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) and, to the extent
permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of
Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if
Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made
under this Section&nbsp;2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have

provisions of this Article&nbsp;VII, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits
or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections&nbsp;1 and 2 of this
Article&nbsp;VII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such
action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expenses (including
attorneys&#146; fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection
therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the
merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i)&nbsp;the disposition being
adverse to Indemnitee, (ii)&nbsp;an adjudication that Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii)&nbsp;a
plea of guilty or nolo contendere by Indemnitee, (iv)&nbsp;an adjudication that Indemnitee did not act
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation, and (v)&nbsp;with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that
Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, Indemnitee shall be considered
for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U>Notification and Defense of Claim</U>. As a condition precedent to an Indemnitee&#146;s
right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as
practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which
indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of
which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at
its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its
election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in this Section&nbsp;4. Indemnitee shall have
the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the

unless (i)&nbsp;the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii)
counsel to Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or
position on any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of the
defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (iii)&nbsp;the Corporation shall not in
fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense of
the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article&nbsp;VII. The Corporation shall
not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by
or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have reasonably made
the conclusion provided for in clause (ii)&nbsp;above. The Corporation shall not be required to
indemnify Indemnitee under this Article&nbsp;VII for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation effected without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any penalty or
limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee&#146;s written consent. Neither the Corporation nor
Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any proposed settlement.

in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 of this Article
VII of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under
this Article&nbsp;VII, any expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee
in defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by
the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the
payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition
of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to
repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article&nbsp;VII; and further
provided that no such advancement of expenses shall be made under this Article&nbsp;VII if it is
determined (in the manner described in Section&nbsp;6) that (i)&nbsp;Indemnitee did not act in good faith and
in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, or (ii)&nbsp;with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee

without reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;<U>Procedure for Indemnification</U>. In order to obtain indemnification or advancement
of expenses pursuant to Section&nbsp;1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article&nbsp;VII, an Indemnitee shall submit to the
Corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any
event within 30&nbsp;days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of Indemnitee, unless
the Corporation determines within such 30-day period that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;1, 2 or 5 of this Article&nbsp;VII, as the case may be. Any
such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to requests under
Section&nbsp;1 or 2 only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the Corporation that
the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each
instance (a)&nbsp;by a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are
not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (&#147;<U>disinterested
directors</U>&#148;), whether or not a quorum, (b)&nbsp;by a committee of disinterested directors designated
by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c)&nbsp;if there are no
disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel
(who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written
opinion, or (d)&nbsp;by the stockholders of the Corporation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;<U>Remedies</U>. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted by
this Article&nbsp;VII shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither
the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section
6 of this Article&nbsp;VII that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a
defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct. Indemnitee&#146;s expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) reasonably incurred in connection
with successfully establishing Indemnitee&#146;s right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any
such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
