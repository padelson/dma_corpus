Principles</U>. The Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for each Taxable Year is intended to measure the decrease or
increase in the actual liability for Taxes of the Company for such Taxable Year attributable to the Tax Assets, determined using
a &ldquo;with and without&rdquo; methodology. The actual liability for Taxes will take into account the deduction of the portion
of the Tax Benefit Payment that must be accounted for as Imputed Interest under the Code based upon the characterization of Tax
Benefit Payments as additional consideration payable for the Class B Units or other equity acquired in an Exchange. Carryovers
or carrybacks of any Tax item attributable to the Tax Assets shall be considered to be subject to the rules of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations governing the use, limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type. If a carryover
or carryback of any Tax item includes a portion that is attributable to the Tax Assets (a &ldquo;<U>TRA Portion</U>&rdquo;) and
another portion that is not (a &ldquo;<U>Non-TRA Portion</U>&rdquo;), such respective portions shall be considered to be used in
accordance with the &ldquo;with and without&rdquo; methodology so that: (i) the amount of any Non-TRA Portion is deemed utilized
first, followed by the amount of any TRA Portion; and (ii) in the case of a carryback of a Non-TRA Portion, such carryback shall
not affect the original &ldquo;with and without&rdquo; calculation made in the prior Taxable Year. The parties agree that (i) to
the extent permitted by law, all payments under this Agreement attributable to Basis Adjustments (other than amounts accounted
for as Imputed Interest under the Code) and other Tax Benefit Payments will (A) be treated as upward purchase price adjustments
that give rise to Basis Adjustments to Reference Assets for the Company and (B) have the effect of creating Basis Adjustments to
Reference Assets for the Company in the year of payment, and (ii) as a result, such Basis Adjustments will be incorporated into
the then-current year calculation and into future year calculations, as appropriate. The parties further agree that amounts accounted
for as Imputed Interest may give rise to additional Tax Benefit Payments in the then-current and/or future years.</P>

Every time the Company delivers to a TRA Party an applicable Schedule under this Agreement, including any Amended Schedule delivered
pursuant to Section 2.3(b), and any Early Termination Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule, the Company shall also (x)
deliver to such TRA Party schedules, valuation reports, if any, and work papers providing reasonable detail regarding the preparation
of the Schedule and an Advisory Firm Letter and (y) allow such TRA Party reasonable access at no cost to the appropriate representatives
at the Company and the Advisory Firm in connection with a review of such Schedule. Without limiting the application of the preceding
sentence, every time the Company delivers to a TRA Party a Tax Benefit Schedule, in addition to the Tax Benefit Schedule duly completed,
the Company shall deliver to such TRA Party the reasonably detailed calculation by the Company or the Advisory Firm of the applicable
Hypothetical Federal Tax Liability and the applicable Actual Federal Tax Liability, as well as any other relevant work papers.
An applicable Schedule or amendment thereto shall become final and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days after the first
date on which the TRA Party has received the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto unless, in the case of a TRA Party, such
TRA Party (i) within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving an applicable Schedule or amendment thereto, provides the Company
with notice of a material objection to such Schedule (&ldquo;<U>Objection Notice</U>&rdquo;) made in good faith or (ii) provides
a written waiver of such right of any Objection Notice within the period described in clause (i) above, in which case such Schedule
or amendment thereto becomes binding on the date the waiver is received by the Company. If the Company and any objecting TRA Party,
for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in an Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by the Company of such Objection Notice, the Company and such TRA Party shall employ the reconciliation procedures as described
in Section 7.9 of this Agreement (the &ldquo;<U>Reconciliation Procedures</U>&rdquo;).</P>

no Tax Benefit Payment shall be made in respect of estimated tax payments, including federal estimated income tax payments. Each

For Tax purposes, the Interest Amount payable on account of an Exchange shall not be treated as interest but instead shall be treated
as additional consideration for the actual or deemed acquisition of Class B Units or other equity interests in Exchanges, unless
otherwise required by law. The &ldquo;<U>Net Tax Benefit</U>&rdquo; for a Taxable Year shall be an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (i) 85% of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit as of the end of such Taxable Year over (ii) the total amount of
payments previously made under Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement (excluding payments attributable to Interest Amounts). For the
avoidance of doubt, no TRA Party shall be required to return any portion of any previously made Tax Benefit Payment. The &ldquo;<U>Interest
Amount</U>&rdquo; in respect of a TRA Party shall equal the interest that would be due on the amount of the unpaid Net Tax Benefit
Attributable to such TRA Party for a Taxable Year if such amount were treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes,

of a Change of Control, all Tax Benefit Payments, whether paid with respect to the Class B Units that were Exchanged (i) prior

the assumptions described in clauses (1) and (3) of the definition of &ldquo;Valuation Assumptions,&rdquo; substituting, in each
case, the terms &ldquo;the date of a Change of Control&rdquo; for an &ldquo;Early Termination Date.&rdquo; In connection with any

the obligation to make payments under this Agreement will continue to accrue for the benefit of the applicable TRA Parties and
the Company will make such payments when it has made all payments due with regard to the Senior Obligation or the holder of the

of a written notice, in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit A</U> (the &ldquo;<B>Exercise Notice</B>&rdquo;), of the Holder&rsquo;s
election to exercise this Warrant and (ii)&nbsp; payment to the Company of an amount equal to the applicable Exercise Price multiplied
by the number of Warrant Shares as to which this Warrant is being exercised (the &ldquo;<B>Aggregate Exercise Price</B>&rdquo;)
in cash or by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by notifying the Company that this Warrant is being exercised pursuant
to a Cashless Exercise (as defined in Section 1(c)). The Holder shall not be required to deliver the original Warrant in order
to effect an exercise hereunder. Execution and delivery of the Exercise Notice with respect to less than all of the Warrant Shares
shall have the same effect as cancellation of the original Warrant and issuance of a new Warrant evidencing the right to purchase
the remaining number of Warrant Shares. On or before the first (1st) Business Day following the date on which the Company has received
each of the Exercise Notice and the Aggregate Exercise Price (or notice of a Cashless Exercise) (the &ldquo;<B>Exercise Delivery
Documents</B>&rdquo;), the Company shall transmit by facsimile an acknowledgment of confirmation of receipt of the Exercise Delivery
Documents to the Holder and the Company&rsquo;s transfer agent (the &ldquo;<B>Transfer Agent</B>&rdquo;). On or before the third
(3rd) Business Day following the date on which the Company has received all of the Exercise Delivery Documents (the &ldquo;<B>Share
Delivery Date</B>&rdquo;), the Company shall (X) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in The Depository Trust Company
(&ldquo;<B>DTC</B>&rdquo;) Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the Holder, credit such aggregate number
of Warrant Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the Holder&rsquo;s or its designee&rsquo;s balance
account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system, or (Y) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the
DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and dispatch by overnight courier to the address as specified in the Exercise
Notice, a certificate, registered in the Company&rsquo;s share register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number
of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise (or, if the Company desires to issue such shares
of Common Stock in book-entry form in lieu of certificates representing such shares of Common Stock, then the Company shall notify
the Holder of such issuance by any manner permitted under Section 6 hereof). Upon confirmation of receipt by the Company of the
Exercise Delivery Documents, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Warrant
Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date such Warrant Shares are credited to the
Holder&rsquo;s DTC account or the date of delivery of the certificates (or entries in book-entry form) evidencing such Warrant
Shares, as the case may be. If this Warrant is submitted in connection with any exercise pursuant to this Section 1(a) and the
number of Warrant Shares represented by this Warrant submitted for exercise is greater than the number of Warrant Shares being
acquired upon an exercise, then the Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable after any such exercise and at the expense
of the Holder, issue a new Warrant (in accordance with Section 5(d)) representing the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares
purchasable immediately prior to such exercise under this Warrant, less the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this
Warrant is exercised. The Company shall pay any and all taxes which may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of
Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant.</P>

outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares

upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares

shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &ldquo;<B>Exchange
Act</B>&rdquo;). For purposes of this Warrant, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may
rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (1) the Company&rsquo;s most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q,
Current Report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;<B>Reported</B>&rdquo;),

Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For purposes of enabling the Holder to comply with the restrictions
in this Section, upon the written request of the Holder, the Company shall within as promptly as reasonably practicable confirm
in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of
Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company by the Holder and
its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was Reported. By written notice to
the Company, the Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess
of 9.8% specified in such notice; provided that any such increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61<SUP>st</SUP>)
