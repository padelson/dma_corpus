                    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

            AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION, dated as of December 16, 2001
(this "Agreement"), by and among CONEXANT SYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Conexant"), WASHINGTON SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Conexant ("Washington"), and ALPHA INDUSTRIES,
INC., a Delaware corporation ("Alpha").

                           W I T N E S S E T H :

            WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Conexant and Washington are entering into a contribution and
distribution agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"Distribution Agreement") pursuant to which (a) all the Washington Assets
(as defined in the Distribution Agreement) will be assigned to Washington
and/or to one or more of the Washington Subsidiaries (as defined in the
Distribution Agreement) and all of the Washington Liabilities (as defined
in the Distribution Agreement) will be assumed by Washington and/or by one
or more of the Washington Subsidiaries, all as provided in the Distribution
Agreement (the "Contribution") and (b) all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Washington (the
"Washington Common Stock") will be distributed on a pro rata basis to
Conexant's stockholders as provided in the Distribution Agreement (the
"Distribution");

            WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Conexant, Washington and
Alpha deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and
its respective stockholders that Washington and Alpha enter into a merger
transaction in order to advance the long-term strategic business interests
of Conexant, Washington and Alpha;

            WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Conexant, Washington and
Alpha have determined to consummate such merger transaction by means of the
business combination transaction provided for herein in which, immediately
following the Distribution Washington will, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Alpha (the "Merger"), with
Alpha being the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in
such capacity as the "Combined Company") in the Merger;

            WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement intend that the
Contribution and the Distribution qualify under Sections 355 and 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as a
reorganization, that the Merger qualify under Section 368 of the Code as a
reorganization and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

            WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger; and

            WHEREAS, capitalized terms used in this Agreement will have the
respective meanings set forth (i) in Section 10.11 or (ii) in the Sections
of this Agreement or in the relevant Reorganization Agreement (as defined
in Section 10.11) set forth opposite such terms in Section 10.11.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
hereto agree as follows:


                                 ARTICLE I

                                 THE MERGER


            SECTION 1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.2(b)), Washington shall merge with and into Alpha. Alpha shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Washington shall terminate.

            SECTION 1.2 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME.

            (a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place
as soon as practicable, but in any event within three Business Days, after
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to Applicable Laws) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date (as defined below)) set forth in Article VIII, unless this
Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the
actual time and date of the Closing being referred to herein as the
"Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Chadbourne &
Parke LLP, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York, unless another place
is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

            (b) The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger relating thereto substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary") on the Closing Date (the
"Certificate of Merger"). The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and
time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificate of
Merger. The Effective Time shall occur immediately after the Time of
Distribution (as defined in the Distribution Agreement).

            SECTION 1.3 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. At and after the Effective
Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Washington shall vest in Alpha, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of Washington shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
Alpha.

            SECTION 1.4 CONVERSION OF WASHINGTON COMMON STOCK. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of Washington, Alpha or the holders of any capital stock of Washington or
Alpha:

            (a) Subject to Section 3.2(d), each share of Washington Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (after
giving effect to the Distribution), other than shares of Washington Common
Stock held in Washington's treasury or owned by Alpha or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Washington or Alpha, shall automatically be converted into
the right to receive 0.342 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock,
par value $.25 per share, of Alpha (including the associated preferred
share purchase rights, the "Alpha Common Stock"). If (i) between the date
hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Alpha Common
Stock, (ii) between the date hereof and the Time of Distribution, the
outstanding shares of Conexant Common Stock (as defined in Section
5.2(b)(i)) or (iii) following the Time of Distribution and prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Washington Common Stock, shall
have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities (or a record date within any such
period shall have been established for any of the foregoing) as a result of
a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization (other
than solely as a result of the Distribution or the Merger, but including
any increase or decrease in the outstanding shares of Conexant Common Stock
as a result of the issuance of any security in accordance with the Conexant
Rights Agreement (as defined in Section 5.2(b)(i)), an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio to the extent
necessary to reflect such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or
similar change in capitalization.

            (b) All shares of Washington Common Stock converted into the
right to receive Alpha Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate or book-entry credit previously evidencing
any such shares of Washington Common Stock (a "Washington Certificate")
shall thereafter evidence only the right to receive (i) the number of whole
shares of Alpha Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested) and (ii) cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Alpha Common Stock into which the shares of Washington
Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Washington Certificate have been
converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 3.2(d), without any
interest thereon.

            (c) All shares of Washington Common Stock held in Washington's
treasury or owned by Alpha, or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Washington or
Alpha shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no shares of Alpha
Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

            SECTION 1.5 ALPHA COMMON STOCK. At and after the Effective
Time, each share of Alpha Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of
common stock of the Combined Company and shall not be affected by the
Merger.

            SECTION 1.6 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. At the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Combined Company shall be in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, with such changes thereto as shall
be mutually agreed upon by Conexant and Alpha (the "Restated Certificate"),
until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof and
Applicable Laws (as defined in Section 10.11).

            SECTION 1.7 BY-LAWS. At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the
Combined Company shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, with
such changes as may be mutually agreed upon by Conexant and Alpha (the
"By-Laws"), until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof,
the Restated Certificate and Applicable Laws.

            SECTION 1.8 OFFICERS. At the Effective Time, David J. Aldrich
shall be Chief Executive Officer of the Combined Company and Moiz M.
Beguwala shall be President of the Combined Company and otherwise the
initial officers of the Combined Company shall be as Conexant and Alpha
shall agree prior to the Effective Time, and such officers shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified,
or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

            SECTION 1.9 BOARD OF DIRECTORS. At the Effective Time, until
duly changed in compliance with the Restated Certificate, the By-Laws and
Applicable Laws, the Board of Directors of the Combined Company shall
consist of either nine or eleven persons (as agreed by Conexant and Alpha
prior to the Effective Time), including (a) four (in the case of a
nine-person Board of Directors) or five (in the case of an eleven-person
Board of Directors) persons (one of whom shall be Chairman of the Board of
the Combined Company) to be named by the Board of Directors of Conexant,
(b) four (in the case of a nine-person Board of Directors) or five (in the
case of an eleven-person Board of Directors) persons to be named by the
Board of Directors of Alpha and (c) one person to be jointly named by the
Boards of Directors of Conexant and Alpha. The directors named by Conexant
and Alpha shall be allocated proportionately among the classes of the Board
of Directors of the Combined Company as shall be agreed between Conexant
and Alpha prior to the Effective Time.

            SECTION 1.10 NAME; CORPORATE OFFICES.

            (a) At the Effective Time, the name of the Combined Company
shall be as agreed by Conexant and Alpha prior to the Effective Time.

            (b) At the Effective Time, the Combined Company shall have
joint headquarters located in Newport Beach, California and Woburn,
Massachusetts.

            SECTION 1.11 FISCAL YEAR. The fiscal year of the Combined
Company will initially end on September 30 of each year.


                                ARTICLE II

                                  OPTIONS


            SECTION 2.1 OPTION CONVERSION. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Washington and Alpha will take all action necessary such that each
Washington Option (as defined in the Employee Matters Agreement) that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto (after giving effect
to the adjustments to Conexant Stock Options (as defined in Section
5.2(b)(i)) to be effected in connection with the Distribution as provided
for in the Employee Matters Agreement) shall cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of Washington Common Stock and shall, as of the Effective
Time, automatically be converted into a Converted Option exercisable for a
number of shares of Alpha Common Stock and at an exercise price determined
as provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the appropriate
Washington Stock Plan (as defined in the Employee Matters Agreement)
governing such option and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder):

                  (i) The number of shares of Alpha Common Stock to be
      subject to the Converted Option shall be equal to the product of the
      number of shares of Washington Common Stock subject to the
      unexercised portion of the Washington Option (as adjusted in
      connection with the Distribution) multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
      provided that any fractional shares of Alpha Common Stock resulting
      from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
      share; and

                  (ii) The exercise price per share of Alpha Common Stock
      under the Converted Option shall be equal to the exercise price per
      share of Washington Common Stock under the Washington Option (as
      adjusted in connection with the Distribution) divided by the Exchange
      Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the
      nearest whole cent.

            SECTION 2.2 INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. The adjustment provided
herein with respect to any options that are "incentive stock options" (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be and is intended to be effected
in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as
set forth in this Section 2.2, the duration and other terms of such
Converted Option shall be the same as the Washington Option, except that
all references to Washington shall be deemed to be references to the
Combined Company (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for
in the Washington Stock Plans by reason of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby).

            SECTION 2.3 SHARES RESERVED; REGISTRATION. Following the
Effective Time, the Combined Company shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Alpha
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Converted Options pursuant
to the terms set forth in this Article II. As soon as practicable but in
any event not later than five days following the Effective Time, the shares
of Alpha Common Stock subject to the Converted Options will be covered by
an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or
another appropriate form and the Combined Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
for so long as the Converted Options remain outstanding.


                                ARTICLE III

                             EXCHANGE OF SHARES


            SECTION 3.1 ALPHA TO MAKE SHARES AVAILABLE. From time to time,
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, Alpha shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company appointed by Conexant
and reasonably acceptable to Alpha (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit
of the holders of the Washington Certificates, for exchange in accordance
with this Article III, the shares of Alpha Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.4 and delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(a) in
exchange for Washington Certificates (such shares of Alpha Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the
"Exchange Fund").

            SECTION 3.2 EXCHANGE OF SHARES.

            (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall make book-entry credits as of the Closing Date for
each holder of record of Washington Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time for that number of whole shares of Alpha Common Stock into
which the shares of Washington Common Stock formerly evidenced by such
holder's Washington Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement and shall deliver to each such holder (x) an account statement
indicating the number of whole shares of Alpha Common Stock that such
holder owns of record as of the Effective Time and (y) a check representing
the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.2(d) in respect of such holder's
Washington Certificate. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in
lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions
payable to holders of Washington Certificates.

            (b) If any certificate or book-entry credit evidencing shares
of Alpha Common Stock is to be registered in a name other than that in
which the Washington Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
the issuance thereof that an appropriate instrument of transfer of
Washington Certificates be delivered and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate or
book-entry credit evidencing shares of Alpha Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Washington Certificate formerly
held, or required for any other reason, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

            (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of Washington of the shares of Washington Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

            (d) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Alpha
Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued in exchange
for Washington Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Alpha Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Alpha. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Alpha shall pay to each
holder of Washington Certificates who otherwise would be entitled to
receive such fractional share an amount in cash determined in the manner
provided in clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 3.2(d).

            (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (x) the number of full
shares of Alpha Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Alpha
pursuant to Section 3.1 for issuance to holders of Washington Certificates
pursuant to Section 1.4 over (y) the aggregate number of full shares of
Alpha Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Washington Certificates
pursuant to this Section 3.2 (such excess being herein referred to as the
"Excess Alpha Shares"). As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of Washington
Certificates, shall sell the Excess Alpha Shares at then prevailing prices
on the Nasdaq National Market System, all in the manner provided in clause
(iii) of this Section 3.2(d).

            (iii) The sale of the Excess Alpha Shares by the Exchange Agent
shall be executed on the Nasdaq National Market System through one or more
member firms of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and
shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net
proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of
Washington Certificates, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in
trust for such holders as part of the Exchange Fund. The Combined Company
shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such
sale or sales of Excess Alpha Shares. In addition, the Combined Company
shall pay the Exchange Agent's compensation and expenses in connection with
such sale or sales. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such
net proceeds to which each holder of Washington Certificates shall be
entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of Washington Certificates is entitled (after
taking into account all Washington Certificates then held by such holder)
and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share
interests to which all holders of Washington Certificates are entitled. As
soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any,
to be paid to holders of Washington Certificates with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such
amounts to such holders of Washington Certificates subject to and in
accordance with this Section 3.2.

            (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
holders of Certificates for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Combined Company, and any holders of Washington
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to the Combined Company for payment of the shares of
Alpha Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Alpha Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each share of Washington Common Stock formerly evidenced by such
Washington Certificate as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without
any interest thereon. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Washington Certificates five years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(iii)) shall, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Laws, become the property of the Combined Company free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

            (f) None of the Combined Company, Conexant, Washington, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of
Washington Certificates for any shares of Alpha Common Stock, cash in lieu
of fractional shares thereof and any dividend or other distribution with
respect thereto delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Laws.

            (g) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund, as directed by the Combined Company, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Combined Company promptly upon request by the Combined Company.

            (h) The Combined Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Washington Certificates such amounts as the
Combined Company or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Combined Company or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Alpha Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Combined Company or the
Exchange Agent.

            SECTION 3.3 AFFILIATES. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no certificates or
book-entry credits evidencing shares of Alpha Common Stock or cash shall be
issued or delivered pursuant to this Article III to a Person who may be
deemed an "affiliate" of Washington in accordance with Section 7.12 hereof
for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), until such Person has executed and delivered an
Affiliate Agreement (as defined in Section 7.12) pursuant to Section 7.12.

                       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


            SECTION 5.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ALPHA. Except as
set forth in the Alpha Disclosure Schedule delivered by Alpha to Conexant
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Alpha Disclosure Schedule")
(each section of which, to the extent specified therein, qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant of Alpha
contained herein and, to the extent it is apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure qualifies another representation and
warranty of Alpha contained herein, such other representation and warranty
of Alpha), Alpha represents and warrants to Conexant as follows:

(a)      Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.

                  (i) Each of Alpha and its Subsidiaries is a corporation
      or other organization duly organized, validly existing and in good
      standing (where applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction of
      incorporation or organization, has the requisite power and authority
      to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
      as now being conducted and as it will be conducted through the
      Effective Time, except where the failure to be so organized, existing
      and in good standing or to have such power and authority,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries, and is
      duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each
      jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
      leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other
      than in such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or to be
      in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and
      its Subsidiaries. The copies of the certificate of incorporation and
      by-laws of Alpha which were previously furnished or made available to
      Conexant are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as
      in effect on the date of this Agreement.

                  (ii) Exhibit 21 to Alpha's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
      the year ended April 1, 2001 includes all the Subsidiaries of Alpha
      which as of the date of this Agreement are Significant Subsidiaries
      of Alpha (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Securities
      and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")). All the --- outstanding shares
      of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such
      Significant Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid
      and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by Alpha, free
      and clear of all material pledges, claims, liens, charges,
      encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
      (collectively, "Liens") and free of any other material -----
      restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
      otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity interests,
      but excluding restrictions under the Securities Act). None of Alpha
      or any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity or
      similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable
      or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any
      corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association
      or entity (other than Subsidiaries of Alpha), that is or would
      reasonably be expected to be material to Alpha and its Subsidiaries
      taken as a whole.

            (b) Capital Structure.

                  (i) The authorized capital stock of Alpha consists of
      100,000,000 shares of Alpha Common Stock. As of December 14, 2001,
      44,174,096 shares of Alpha Common Stock were issued and outstanding
      and no other shares of capital stock of Alpha were issued and
      outstanding. As of December 14, 2001, 10,370,507 shares of Alpha
      Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of options
      outstanding under Alpha Stock Plans. As of December 14, 2001, no
      shares of Alpha Common Stock were held as treasury shares. Since
      December 14, 2001 to the date of this Agreement, no shares of capital
      stock of Alpha or any other securities of Alpha have been issued
      other than shares of Alpha Common Stock issued pursuant to options or
      rights outstanding as of December 14, 2001 under the Alpha Stock
      Plans. All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Alpha
      are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
      and no class of capital stock of Alpha is entitled to preemptive
      rights. There are outstanding as of the date hereof no options,
      warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock from Alpha other
      than options and other rights to acquire Alpha Common Stock from
      Alpha ("Alpha Stock Options") representing in the aggregate the right
      to purchase 6,619,900 shares of Alpha Common Stock under the Alpha
      Stock Plans. Section 5.1(b) of the Alpha Disclosure Schedule sets
      forth a complete and correct list as of a recent date of all
      outstanding Alpha Stock Options and the exercise prices thereof.

                  (ii) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
      Alpha having the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders
      of Alpha may vote ("Alpha Voting Debt") are issued or outstanding.

                  (iii) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section
      5.1(b), as of the date of this Agreement, there are no securities,
      options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements,
      arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which Alpha or any of its
      Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound obligating
      Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause
      to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock
      or other voting securities of Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries or
      obligating Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend
      or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right,
      commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking. As of the date of
      this Agreement, there are no outstanding obligations of Alpha or any
      of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
      shares of capital stock of Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (c) Authority; No Conflicts.

                  (i) Alpha has all requisite corporate power and authority
      to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
      contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of the consummation of the
      Merger, to the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger
      by the Required Alpha Vote (as defined in Section 5.1(g)). The
      execution and delivery of this Agreement by Alpha and the
      consummation by Alpha of the transactions contemplated hereby have
      been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
      Alpha, subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to the
      approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the
      Required Alpha Vote. This Agreement has been duly executed and
      delivered by Alpha and, assuming the due authorization and valid
      execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Conexant and
      Washington, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Alpha,
      enforceable against Alpha in accordance with its terms, except as
      such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
      reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and similar
      Applicable Laws relating to or affecting creditors generally or by
      general equity principles (regardless of whether such enforceability
      is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

                  (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
      Alpha does not, and the consummation by Alpha of the Merger and the
      other transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or
      result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default (with
      or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
      right of or result by its terms in the termination, amendment,
      cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a
      material benefit under, or the creation of a Lien, charge, "put" or
      "call" right or other encumbrance on, or the loss of, any assets (any
      such conflict, breach, violation, default, right of termination,
      amendment, cancellation or acceleration, loss or creation, a
      "Violation") pursuant to: (A) any provision of the certificate of
      incorporation or by-laws or similar organizational documents of Alpha
      or any Significant Subsidiary of Alpha or (B) except as, individually
      or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries or, to the
      Knowledge of Alpha, the Combined Company and its Subsidiaries
      following the Merger, subject to obtaining or making the Alpha
      Necessary Consents (as defined in paragraph (iii) below), (I) any
      loan or credit agreement, note, instrument, mortgage, bond,
      indenture, lease, benefit plan or other contract, agreement or
      obligation (a "Contract") to which Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries
      is a party or by which any of them or any of their respective
      properties or assets is bound, or (II) any permit, concession,
      franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance,
      rule or regulation applicable to Alpha or any Subsidiary of Alpha or
      their respective properties or assets.

                  (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
      registration, declaration or filing with, any supranational,
      national, state, municipal, local or foreign government, any
      instrumentality, subdivision, court, administrative agency or
      commission or other authority thereof, or any quasi-governmental or
      private body exercising any regulatory, taxing, importing or other
      governmental or quasi-governmental authority (a "Governmental
      Entity") or any other Person is required by or with respect to Alpha
      or any Subsidiary of Alpha in connection with the execution and
      delivery of this Agreement by Alpha or the consummation by Alpha of
      the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except for
      those required under or in relation to (A) the Required Alpha Vote,

      amended (the "HSR Act"), (C) state securities or "blue sky" laws, (D)
      the Securities Act, (E) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
      amended (the "Exchange Act"), (F) the DGCL with respect to the filing
      of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary, (G) the
      rules and regulations of Nasdaq, (H) antitrust or other competition
      laws of other jurisdictions and (I) such consents, approvals, orders,
      authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure
      of which to make or obtain, individually or in the aggregate, would
      not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha
      and its Subsidiaries. Consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
      registrations, declarations and filings required under or in relation
      to any of the foregoing clauses (A) through (H) or set forth in
      Section 5.1(c)(iii) of the Alpha Disclosure Schedule are hereinafter
      referred to as "Alpha Necessary Consents".

                  (d) Reports and Financial Statements.

                  (i) Alpha has filed all registration statements,
      prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
      documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1,
      2000 (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the "Alpha SEC
      Reports"). No Subsidiary of Alpha is subject to the periodic
      reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. None of the Alpha SEC
      Reports, as of their respective dates (or, if amended or superseded
      by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of
      such filing) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
      omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
      necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
      circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
      financial statements (including the related notes) included in the
      Alpha SEC Reports fairly presents, in all material respects, the
      consolidated financial position and consolidated results of
      operations and cash flows of Alpha and its consolidated Subsidiaries
      as of the respective dates or for the respective periods set forth
      therein, all in conformity with generally accepted accounting
      principles ("GAAP") consistently applied during the ---- periods
      involved except as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the case
      of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal and recurring
      year-end adjustments that have not been and are not expected to be
      material in amount. All Alpha SEC Reports, as of their respective
      dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the respective Alpha
      SEC Report), complied as to form in all material respects with the
      applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
      and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

                  (ii) Except as disclosed in the Alpha SEC Reports filed
      and publicly available prior to the date hereof (the "Alpha Filed SEC
      Reports"), since April 1, 2001, Alpha and its Subsidiaries have not
      incurred any liabilities that are of a nature that would be required
      to be disclosed on a balance sheet of Alpha and its Subsidiaries or
      in the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than
      liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business or that,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries.

                  (e) Information Supplied.

                  (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
      Alpha for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the Form S-4
      (as defined in Section 7.1(a)) will, at the time the Form S-4 is
      filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at
      the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
      untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
      fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
      statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
      were made, not misleading and (B) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as
      defined in Section 7.1(a)) will, on the date it is first mailed to
      Conexant stockholders or Alpha stockholders or at the time of the
      Alpha Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 7.1(b)), contain
      any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
      fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
      statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
      were made, not misleading.

                  (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
      Section 5.1(e), no representation or warranty is made by Alpha with
      respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form
      S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied
      by Conexant or Washington for inclusion or incorporation by reference
      therein, or based on information with is not included or incorporated
      by reference in such documents but which should have been disclosed
      therein pursuant to Section 5.2(e).

            (f) Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Alpha, by
resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and
held and, other than as provided for in Section 7.5, not subsequently
rescinded or modified in any way, has duly (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of Alpha
and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the Merger, (iii)
resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Alpha approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger and directed that this Agreement and the Merger be
submitted for consideration by Alpha's stockholders at the Alpha

(A) the limitations on business combinations contained in Section 203 of
the DGCL (or any similar provision) and (B) the provisions of Article
Fifteenth of Alpha's Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby. To the Knowledge of Alpha, except for the
limitations on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
(which have been rendered inapplicable), no state takeover statute is
applicable or purports to be applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

            (g) Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Alpha Common Stock (the "Required
Alpha Vote") to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger is the only
vote of the holders of any class or series of Alpha capital stock necessary
to approve or adopt this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

            (h) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

                  (i) Except as set forth in the Alpha Filed SEC Reports,
      there is no suit, action, proceeding or regulatory investigation
      pending or, to the Knowledge of Alpha, threatened, against or
      affecting Alpha or any Subsidiary of Alpha or any property or asset
      of Alpha or any Subsidiary of Alpha which, individually or in the
      aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
      Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries, nor is there any judgment,
      decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or
      arbitrator outstanding against Alpha or any Subsidiary of Alpha
      which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
      to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries.

                  (ii) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
      not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha
      and its Subsidiaries, Alpha and its Subsidiaries hold all permits,
      licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of
      all Governmental Entities which are necessary for the operation of
      the businesses of Alpha and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the
      "Alpha Permits"), and no suspension or cancellation of any of the
      Alpha Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of Alpha, threatened,
      except for suspensions or cancellations which, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries. Alpha and its
      Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Alpha Permits,
      except where the failure so to comply, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries. None of Alpha or any of
      its Subsidiaries is in violation of, and Alpha and its Subsidiaries
      have not received any notices of violations with respect to, any
      Applicable Laws, except for violations which, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries.

Reports, since April 1, 2001, there has not been any event, change,
circumstance or development which, individually or in the aggregate, has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
Alpha and its Subsidiaries. Since April 1, 2001 through the date of this
Agreement, none of Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action
that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of Section 6.1 (other than
Section 6.1(a)(i)).

            (j) Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in the Alpha
Filed SEC Reports and except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and
its Subsidiaries, (i) the operations of Alpha and its Subsidiaries have
been and are in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws (as
defined below) and with all Alpha Permits required by applicable
Environmental Laws, (ii) there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Alpha, threatened, actions, suits, claims, investigations or other
proceedings (collectively, "Actions") under or pursuant to Environmental
Laws against Alpha or its Subsidiaries or involving any real property
currently owned or, to the Knowledge of Alpha, formerly owned, or currently
or formerly operated or leased, by Alpha or its Subsidiaries and (iii) to
the Knowledge of Alpha, Alpha and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any
Environmental Liabilities (as defined below), and no facts, circumstances
or conditions relating to, arising from, associated with or attributable to
any real property currently or formerly owned, operated or leased by Alpha
or its Subsidiaries or operations thereon would reasonably be expected to
result in Environmental Liabilities for Alpha or its Subsidiaries. The
representations and warranties in this Section 5.1(j) constitute the sole
representations and warranties of Alpha concerning environmental matters in
this Agreement.

Filed SEC Reports and except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Alpha and its Subsidiaries: (i) Alpha and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or
is licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any Liens), all

conduct of its business as currently conducted; (ii) to the Knowledge of
Alpha, the use of any Intellectual Property by Alpha and its Subsidiaries
does not infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any Person; (iii)
the use of Intellectual Property by or on behalf of Alpha and its

Property; (iv) to the Knowledge of Alpha, no Person is challenging,

Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by and/or
licensed to Alpha or its Subsidiaries; and (v) Alpha does not have any
Knowledge of any pending claim, order or proceeding with respect to any use
of Intellectual Property by Alpha and its Subsidiaries and, to the
Knowledge of Alpha, no Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by Alpha
or its Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation or
unenforceability of such Intellectual Property. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Intellectual Property" shall mean trademarks, service marks,

            (l) Title to Properties. Each of Alpha and its Subsidiaries has
good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets,
valid leasehold interests in, all of its tangible properties and assets,
except where the failure to have such good and valid title, or valid
leasehold interest, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and its
Subsidiaries.

            (m) Brokers or Finders. No agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any
broker's or finder's fee or any other similar commission or fee in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Alpha or any of its
Subsidiaries, except U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray (the "Alpha Financial
Advisor"), whose fees and expenses will be paid by Alpha in accordance with
Alpha's agreement with such firm.

            (n) Opinion of Alpha Financial Advisor. Alpha has received the
opinion of the Alpha Financial Advisor, dated the date of this Agreement,
to the effect that, as of such date, the consideration to be paid to
Washington's stockholders in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of
view, to Alpha and its stockholders.

            (o) Taxes.

                  (i) Each of Alpha and its Subsidiaries has timely filed
      or has caused to be timely filed all Tax returns or reports required
      to be filed by it, or requests for extensions to file such returns or
      reports have been timely filed, granted and have not expired, and all
      such returns and reports are complete and correct, except to the
      extent that such failures to file, to have extensions granted that
      remain in effect or to be complete or correct, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries. Alpha and each of its
      Subsidiaries has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes shown as due on
      such returns and the most recent financial statements contained in
      the Alpha Filed SEC Reports reflect an adequate reserve in accordance
      with GAAP for all Taxes payable by Alpha and its Subsidiaries for all
      taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such
      financial statements.

                  (ii) No deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed,
      asserted or assessed in writing against Alpha or any of its
      Subsidiaries that are not adequately reserved for, except for
      deficiencies that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and
      its Subsidiaries. The U.S. federal income Tax returns of Alpha and
      each of its Subsidiaries consolidated in such returns have been
      either examined by and settled with the IRS or closed by virtue of
      the applicable statute of limitations and no requests for waivers of
      the time to assess any such Taxes are pending.

                  (iii) None of Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries has taken
      any action, and Alpha has no Knowledge of any fact, agreement, plan
      or other circumstance, that is reasonably likely to prevent the
      Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
      Section 368(a) of the Code.

                  (iv) None of Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
      to any Tax sharing or Tax indemnity agreements (other than agreements
      between or among Alpha and its Subsidiaries).

                  (v) Within the past five years, none of Alpha or any of
      its Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a
      "controlled corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify under
      Section 355(a) of the Code.

                  (vi) Except as would not, individually or in the
      aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
      on Alpha and its Subsidiaries, none of Alpha or any of its
      Subsidiaries is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any
      contract that could obligate it to make any payments, that would not
      be deductible by reason of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the
      Code.

                  (vii) None of Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries has agreed
      to make, or is required to make, any material adjustment under
      Section 481(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state, local
      or foreign law by reason of a change in accounting methods or
      otherwise.

            (p) Certain Contracts. As of the date hereof, none of Alpha or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any non-competition
agreement or any other Contract that limits or otherwise restricts Alpha or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or any
successor thereto, or that would, after the Effective Time, to the
Knowledge of Alpha, limit or restrict the Combined Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or any successor
thereto, from engaging or competing in any line of business in any
geographic area, which agreements or other Contracts, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Combined Company and its Subsidiaries, after giving effect to
the Merger or (ii) any employee benefit plan, employee contract or any
other material Contract, pursuant to which any benefits will arise or be
increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by
the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All material
Contracts of Alpha and its Subsidiaries are valid and binding on Alpha and
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect except to the
extent they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or if
the failure to be valid, binding and in full force and effect, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries. None of Alpha or any of its
Subsidiaries has Knowledge of, or has received notice of, any violation or
default under (nor to their Knowledge does there exist any condition which
with the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a
violation or default under) the provisions of any Contract of Alpha or any
of its Subsidiaries, except for violations or defaults which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries.

(q)      Employee Benefits.

                  (i) With respect to each Alpha Plan, except for Alpha
      Plans the liabilities under which, individually or in the aggregate,
      would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
      Alpha and its Subsidiaries, Alpha has made available to Conexant a
      true, correct and complete copy of: (A) all plan documents, trust
      agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles; (B)
      the three most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) and
      accompanying schedules and exhibits, if any; (C) the current summary
      plan description and any material modifications thereto, if any (in
      each case, whether or not required to be furnished under ERISA); (D)
      the three most recent annual financial reports, if any; (E) the three
      most recent actuarial reports, if any; (F) the most recent
      determination letter from the IRS, if any; and (G) the annual
      compliance testing under Sections 401(a) through 416 of the Code for
      the three most recently completed plan years, if any.

                  (ii) With respect to each Alpha Plan, Alpha and its
      Subsidiaries have complied with, and are now in compliance with, all
      provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other Applicable Laws and
      regulations applicable to such Alpha Plans and each Alpha Plan has
      been administered in accordance with its terms, in each case except
      as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and its
      Subsidiaries. Each Alpha Plan that is required by ERISA to be funded
      is fully funded in accordance with reasonable actuarial assumptions,
      except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and its
      Subsidiaries.

                  (iii) All Alpha Plans subject to the Applicable Laws of
      any jurisdiction outside of the United States (A) have been
      maintained in accordance with all applicable requirements, (B) if
      they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all
      requirements for such treatment, and (C) if they are intended to be
      funded and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book-reserved, as
      appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions, in each
      case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and
      its Subsidiaries.

                  (iv) None of Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries has any
      liability under or obligation to any Multiemployer Plan.

            (r) Labor Relations. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) none
of Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining
agreement, (ii) except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Alpha and its
Subsidiaries, no labor organization or group of employees of Alpha or any
of its Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or

or petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to
the Knowledge of Alpha, threatened to be brought or filed, with the
National Labor Relations Board or any other domestic or foreign labor
relations tribunal or authority and (iii) except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries, there are no organizing activities,
strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, arbitrations or grievances,

against or involving Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries.

            (s) Insurance. Alpha maintains insurance coverage with
reputable insurers in such amounts and covering such risks as is deemed
reasonably appropriate for its business (taking into account the cost and
availability of such insurance).

            (t) Liens. No Liens exist on any assets of Alpha or any of its
Subsidiaries, except (i) Liens expressly set forth in the notes to Alpha's
audited consolidated financial statements as of April 1, 2001 included in
the Alpha Filed SEC Reports, (ii) Liens consisting of zoning or planning
restrictions, easements, permits or other restrictions or limitations on
the use of real property or irregularities in title thereto which do not
materially detract from the value of, or impair the use of, such property
by Alpha and its Subsidiaries, (iii) Liens for current taxes, assessments
or governmental charges or levies on property not yet due or which are
being contested in good faith and for which appropriate reserves in
accordance with GAAP have been created and (iv) Liens which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Alpha and its Subsidiaries.

            SECTION 5.2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CONEXANT. Except
as set forth in the Conexant Disclosure Schedule delivered by Conexant to
Alpha prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Conexant Disclosure
Schedule") (each section of which, to the extent specified therein,
qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or
covenant of Conexant contained herein and, to the extent it is apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such disclosure qualifies another
representation and warranty of Conexant contained herein, such other
representation and warranty of Conexant), Conexant represents and warrants
to Alpha as follows:

            (a) Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.


                  (i) Conexant and each Subsidiary of Conexant engaged in
      the Washington Business (as defined in the Distribution Agreement) is
      a corporation or other organization duly organized, validly existing
      and in good standing (where applicable) under the laws of its
      jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, except where the
      failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington Business. Each of
      the Washington Companies (as defined in Section 10.11) has the
      requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its
      properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as
      it will be conducted through the Effective Time, except where the
      failure to have such power and authority, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect on the Washington Business, and is duly qualified and
      in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
      nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties
      makes such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions
      where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington Business. The copies
      of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Conexant which
      were previously furnished or made available to Alpha are true,
      complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the
      date of this Agreement.

                  (ii) Washington is a corporation duly incorporated,
      validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
      Delaware. Washington is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Conexant.
      The copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
      Washington which were previously furnished or made available to Alpha
      are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect
      on the date of this Agreement.

                  (iii) Section 5.2(a)(iii) of the Conexant Disclosure
      Schedule sets forth a list of the Washington Companies which as of
      the date of this Agreement would be Significant Subsidiaries of
      Washington (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) if
      the Distribution had occurred immediately prior to the date hereof
      (the "Washington Significant Subsidiaries"). All the outstanding
      shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
      Washington Significant Subsidiary have been validly issued and are
      fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by
      Conexant, free and clear of all material Liens and free of any other
      material restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
      sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity
      interests, but excluding restrictions under the Securities Act). None
      of the Washington Companies directly or indirectly owns any equity or
      similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable
      or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any
      corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association
      or entity (other than Subsidiaries of Conexant) that is or would
      reasonably be expected to be material to the Washington Business
      taken as a whole.

            (b) Capital Structure.

                  (i) The authorized capital stock of Conexant consists of
      1,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the

      without par value (the "Conexant Preferred Stock"), 1,500,000 shares

      designated as "Series B Voting Preferred Stock" were issued and
      outstanding and no other shares of capital stock of Conexant were
      issued and outstanding. As of November 30, 2001, 84,082,811 shares of

      to preemptive rights. There are outstanding as of the date hereof no
      options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock from

      the holders of Conexant Common Stock pursuant to the Rights Agreement
      dated as of November 30, 1998, as amended as of December 9, 1999,
      between Conexant and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C., as
      Rights Agent (the "Conexant Rights Agreement"), (x) options and other
      rights to acquire Conexant Common Stock from Conexant ("Conexant

      51,394,095 shares of Conexant Common Stock under the Conexant Stock
      Plans, (y) $94,849,000 aggregate principal amount of Conexant's 4
      1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 and $615,000,000

      respectively, per share (collectively, the "Conexant Convertible
      Notes") and (z) Exchangeable Shares of Philsar Semiconductor Inc.
      which are exchangeable into, or subject to retraction in exchange
      for, an aggregate of 357,640 shares of Conexant Common Stock. Section
      5.2(b) of the Conexant Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
      correct list as of a recent date of all outstanding Conexant Stock
      Options and the exercise prices thereof.

                  (ii) On the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of
      Washington consists of 1,000 shares of Washington Common Stock, all
      of which are issued and outstanding.

                  (iii) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section
      5.2(b) or as provided for in the Reorganization Agreements, as of the
      date of this Agreement, there are no securities, options, warrants,
      calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings
      of any kind to which Conexant or any member of the Washington Group
      (as defined in the Distribution Agreement) is a party or by which any
      of them is bound obligating any of Conexant or any member of the
      Washington Group to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
      delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or other voting
      securities of Conexant or any member of the Washington Group or
      obligating Conexant or any member of the Washington Group to issue,
      grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call,
      right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking. As of the
      date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding obligations of
      Conexant or any member of the Washington Group to repurchase, redeem
      or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Conexant or any
      member of the Washington Group.

            (c) Authority; No Conflicts.

                  (i) Conexant has all requisite corporate power and
      authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
      transactions contemplated hereby, subject to further action of the
      Board of Directors of Conexant to establish the Record Date and the
      Distribution Date (each as defined in the Distribution Agreement) and
      provided that the effectiveness of the declaration of the
      Distribution by the Board of Directors of Conexant is subject to the
      satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Distribution
      Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
      Reorganization Agreements by Conexant and the consummation by
      Conexant of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
      been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
      Conexant, subject to further action of the Board of Directors of
      Conexant to establish the Record Date and the Distribution Date and
      provided that the effectiveness of the declaration of the
      Distribution by the Board of Directors of Conexant is subject to the
      satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Distribution
      Agreement. This Agreement and the Distribution Agreement have been,
      and the other Reorganization Agreements will be, duly executed and
      delivered by Conexant and, assuming the due authorization and valid
      execution and delivery of this Agreement by Alpha, constitute or will
      constitute valid and binding agreements of Conexant, enforceable
      against Conexant in accordance with their respective terms, except as
      such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
      reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and similar
      Applicable Laws relating to or affecting creditors generally or by
      general equity principles (regardless of whether such enforceability
      is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

                  (ii) Washington has all requisite corporate power and
      authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
      transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
      Agreement by Washington and the consummation by Washington of the
      transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
      necessary corporate action on the part of Washington. Conexant, as
      the sole stockholder of Washington, has duly approved and adopted
      this Agreement and the Merger and has duly approved the transactions
      contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
      delivered by Washington and constitutes a valid and binding agreement
      of Washington, enforceable against Washington in accordance with its
      terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
      insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and
      similar Applicable Laws relating to or affecting creditors generally
      and by general equity principles (regardless of whether such
      enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

                  (iii) The execution and delivery by Conexant and

      documents of Conexant, Washington or any Washington Significant
      Subsidiary or (B) except as, individually or in the aggregate, would

                  (iv) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or

      and the effectiveness of the declaration of the Distribution by the
      Board of Directors of Conexant (which is subject to the satisfaction
      of the conditions set forth in the Distribution Agreement) and (I)
      such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
      declarations and filings the failure of which to make or obtain,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington Business. Consents,
      approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
      filings required under or in relation to any of the foregoing clauses
      (A) through (H) or set forth in Section 5.2(c)(iv) of the Conexant
      Disclosure Schedule are hereinafter referred to as the "Conexant
      Necessary Consents".

                  (v) The Board of Directors of Conexant, by resolutions
      duly adopted by a unanimous vote of those in attendance at a meeting
      duly called and held, a quorum being present, has duly (i) determined
      that this Agreement is advisable and in the best interests of
      Conexant and its stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement and
      the Distribution Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
      and thereby. The Board of Directors of Washington, by resolutions
      duly adopted by a unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and held,
      or by action by unanimous written consent, has duly (i) determined
      that this Agreement is advisable and in the best interests of
      Washington and its stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement and
      the transactions contemplated hereby.

            (d)   Reports and Financial Statements.

                  (i) No member of the Washington Group is subject to the
      periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. With respect to
      the Washington Business, none of the registration statements,
      prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
      documents required to be filed by Conexant and its Subsidiaries with
      the SEC since January 1, 2000 (collectively, including all exhibits
      thereto, the "Conexant SEC Reports"), as of their respective dates
      (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
      Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contained any untrue
      statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
      required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
      therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
      not misleading.

                  (ii) Included in Section 5.2(d)(ii) of the Conexant
      Disclosure Schedule are a special purpose statement as of September
      30, 2001 of tangible assets and liabilities to be contributed by
      Conexant and its Subsidiaries to the Washington Group (together with
      the notes thereto, the "Unaudited Special Purpose Statement of
      Tangible Net Assets") and a special purpose product line contribution
      statement with respect to the Washington Business for the year ended
      September 30, 2001 (together with the notes thereto, and collectively
      with the Unaudited Special Purpose Statement of Tangible Net Assets,
      the "Washington Financial Statements"). The Washington Financial
      Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the tangible
      assets and liabilities to be contributed by Conexant and its
      Subsidiaries to the Washington Group as of September 30, 2001 and the
      product line contribution of the Washington Business for the year
      ended September 30, 2001.

                  (iii) Except as disclosed in the Conexant SEC Reports
      filed and publicly available prior to the date hereof (the "Conexant
      Filed SEC Reports") or in the Washington Financial Statements, since
      September 30, 2001, Conexant and its Subsidiaries have not incurred
      any liabilities that are of a nature that would be required to be
      disclosed on a statement of assets and liabilities of the Washington
      Business or in the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity with
      GAAP, other than liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
      business or that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
      Washington Business.

            (e) Information Supplied.

                  (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
      Conexant or Washington for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
      (A) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the
      SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it
      becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
      statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
      required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
      therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
      not misleading and (B) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, on the
      date it is first mailed to Conexant stockholders or Alpha
      stockholders or at the time of the Alpha Stockholders Meeting,
      contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
      material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
      make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
      which they were made, not misleading.

                  (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
      Section 5.2(e), no representation or warranty is made by Conexant
      with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the
      Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information
      supplied by Alpha for inclusion or incorporation by reference
      therein, or based on information which is not included or
      incorporated by reference in such documents but which should have
      been disclosed pursuant to Section 5.1(e).

            (f) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

                  (i) Except as set forth in the Conexant Filed SEC Reports
      or in the Washington Financial Statements, there is no suit, action,
      proceeding or regulatory investigation pending or, to the Knowledge
      of Conexant, threatened, against or affecting any of the Washington
      Companies or any property or asset included in the Washington Assets
      which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
      to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington Business, nor is
      there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
      Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against any of the
      Washington Companies which, individually or in the aggregate, would
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
      Washington Business.

                  (ii) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
      not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
      Washington Business, the Washington Companies hold all permits,
      licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of
      all Governmental Entities which are necessary for the operation of
      the Washington Business, taken as a whole (the "Washington Permits"),
      and no suspension or cancellation of any of the Washington Permits is
      pending or, to the Knowledge of Conexant, threatened, except for
      suspensions or cancellations which, individually or in the aggregate,
      would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
      the Washington Business. The Washington Companies are in compliance
      with the terms of the Washington Permits, except where the failure so
      to comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington
      Business. None of the Washington Companies is in violation of, and
      the Washington Companies have not received any notices of violations
      with respect to, any Applicable Laws, except for violations which,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington Business.

            (g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth
in the Conexant Filed SEC Reports or in the Washington Financial
Statements, since September 30, 2001, the Washington Companies have
conducted the Washington Business only in the ordinary course, consistent
with past practice. Except as set forth in the Conexant Filed SEC Reports,
since September 30, 2001, there has not been any event, change,
circumstance or development which, individually or in the aggregate, has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Washington Business. Since September 30, 2001 through the date of this
Agreement, none of the Washington Companies has taken any action that, if
taken during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, would constitute a breach of Section 6.2 (other than
Section 6.2(a)(i)). Washington has not conducted any activities other than
in connection with the organization of Washington, the negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the Reorganization
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

            (h) Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in the Conexant
Filed SEC Reports or in the Washington Financial Statements and except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington Business, (i) the operations of
the Washington Companies have been and are in compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws and with all Washington Permits required by
applicable Environmental Laws, (ii) there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Conexant, threatened, Actions under or pursuant to
Environmental Laws against the Washington Companies or involving any real
property currently owned or formerly owned, or currently or formerly
operated or leased, by the Washington Companies and (iii) to the Knowledge
of Conexant, the Washington Companies are not subject to any Environmental
Liabilities and no facts, circumstances or conditions relating to, arising
from, associated with or attributable to any real property currently or
formerly owned, operated or leased by the Washington Companies or
operations thereon would reasonably be expected to result in Environmental
Liabilities for the Washington Companies. The representations and
warranties in this Section 5.2(h) constitute the sole representations and
warranties of Conexant concerning environmental matters in this Agreement.

            (i) Intellectual Property. Except as set forth in the Conexant
Filed SEC Reports or in the Washington Financial Statements and except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington Business: (i) the Washington
Companies own, or are licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any
Liens), all Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the conduct of
the Washington Business as currently conducted; (ii) to the Knowledge of
Conexant, the use of any Intellectual Property by the Washington Companies
does not infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any Person; (iii)
the use of Intellectual Property by or on behalf of the Washington
Companies is in accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which
the Washington Companies acquired the right to use any Intellectual
Property; (iv) to the Knowledge of Conexant, no Person is challenging,
infringing on or otherwise violating any right of the Washington Companies
with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by and/or licensed to the
Washington Companies; and (v) Conexant does not have any Knowledge of any
pending claim, order or proceeding with respect to any use of Intellectual
Property by the Washington Companies and, to the Knowledge of Conexant, no
Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by the Washington Companies is
being used or enforced in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such
Intellectual Property.

            (j) Title to Properties. Each of the Washington Companies has
good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets,
valid leasehold interests in, all of the tangible properties and assets
that are Washington Assets, except where the failure to have such good and
valid title, or valid leasehold interest, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Washington Business.

            (k) Brokers or Finders. No agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any
broker's or finder's fee or any other similar commission or fee in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Conexant or any of its
Subsidiaries, except Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation (the "Conexant
Financial Advisor"), whose fees and expenses will be paid by Conexant in
accordance with Conexant's agreement with such firm.

            (l) Opinion of Conexant Financial Advisor. Conexant has
received the opinion of the Conexant Financial Advisor, dated the date of
this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the Exchange Ratio is
fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Conexant Common Stock.

            (m) Taxes.

                  (i) Each of the Washington Companies has timely filed or
      has caused to be timely filed all Tax returns or reports required to
      be filed by it with respect to Taxes for which the Washington Group
      will have liability following the Time of Distribution pursuant to
      the Tax Allocation Agreement, or requests for extensions to file such
      returns or reports have been timely filed, granted and have not
      expired, and all such returns and reports are complete and correct,
      except to the extent that such failures to file, to have extensions
      granted that remain in effect or to be complete or correct,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington Business. The
      Washington Companies have paid or caused to be paid all Taxes shown
      as due on such returns, other than Taxes for which the Conexant Group
      will have liability following the Time of Distribution pursuant to
      the Tax Allocation Agreement.

                  (ii) No deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed,
      asserted or assessed in writing against the Washington Companies that
      are not adequately reserved for, except for deficiencies that,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington Business and
      deficiencies with respect to Taxes for which Conexant will have
      liability following the Time of Distribution pursuant to the Tax
      Allocation Agreement. The U.S. federal income Tax returns required to
      be filed with respect to Taxes for which the Washington Group will
      have liability following the Time of Distribution pursuant to the Tax
      Allocation Agreement have been either examined by and settled with
      the IRS or closed by virtue of the applicable statute of limitations
      and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are
      pending.

                  (iii) None of Conexant or its Subsidiaries has taken any
      action, and Conexant has no Knowledge of any fact, agreement, plan or
      other circumstance, that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger
      from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
      368(a) of the Code.

                  (iv) No member of the Washington Group is a party to any
      Tax sharing or Tax indemnity agreements (other than agreements
      between or among members of the Washington Group) that will be in
      effect after the Time of Distribution.

                  (v) Within the past five years, no member of the
      Washington Group has been a "distributing corporation" or a
      "controlled corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify under
      Section 355(a) of the Code.

                  (vi) Except as would not, individually or in the
      aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
      on the Washington Business, no member of the Washington Group is
      obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any contract that
      could obligate it to make any payments, that would not be deductible
      by reason of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.

                  (vii) No member of the Washington Group has agreed to
      make, or is required to make, any material adjustment under Section
      481(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or
      foreign law by reason of a change in accounting methods or otherwise.

            (n) Certain Contracts. As of the date hereof, none of the
Washington Companies is a party to or bound by (i) any non-competition
agreement or any other Contract that will be binding on any member of the
Washington Group following the Time of Distribution that limits or
otherwise restricts the Washington Companies or any of their respective
affiliates or any successor thereto, or that would, after the Effective
Time, to the Knowledge of Conexant, limit or restrict the Combined Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or any
successor thereto, from engaging or competing in any line of business in
any geographic area, which agreements or other Contracts, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Combined Company and its Subsidiaries, after giving effect to
the Merger or (ii) any employee benefit plan, employee contract or any
other material Contract that will be binding on any member of the
Washington Group following the Time of Distribution, pursuant to which any
benefits will arise or be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of
which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which
will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. All material Contracts that will be included in the
Washington Assets are valid and binding on the Washington Companies, as
applicable, and in full force and effect except to the extent they have
previously expired in accordance with their terms or if the failure to be
valid, binding and in full force and effect, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Washington Business. None of the Washington Companies has
Knowledge of, or has received notice of, any violation or default under
(nor to their Knowledge does there exist any condition which with the
passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a violation or
default under) the provisions of any Contract of the Washington Companies
that will be included in the Washington Assets, except for violations or
defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington Business.

            (o) Employee Benefits.

                  (i) With respect to each Washington Plan, except for
      Washington Plans the liabilities under which, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect on the Washington Business, Conexant has made
      available to Alpha a true, correct and complete copy of: (A) all plan
      documents, trust agreements, and insurance contracts and other
      funding vehicles; (B) the three most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500
      Series) and accompanying schedules and exhibits, if any; (C) the
      current summary plan description and any material modifications
      thereto, if any (in each case, whether or not required to be
      furnished under ERISA); (D) the three most recent annual financial
      reports, if any; (E) the three most recent actuarial reports, if any;
      (F) the most recent determination letter from the IRS, if any; and
      (G) the annual compliance testing under Sections 401(a) through 416
      of the Code for the three most recently completed plan years, if any.

                  (ii) With respect to each Washington Plan, Conexant and
      its Subsidiaries have complied with, and are now in compliance with,
      all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other Applicable Laws and
      regulations applicable to such Washington Plans and each Washington
      Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms, in each case
      except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington
      Business. Each Washington Plan that is required by ERISA to be funded
      is fully funded in accordance with reasonable actuarial assumptions,
      except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Washington
      Business.

                  (iii) All Washington Plans subject to the Applicable Laws
      of any jurisdiction outside of the United States (A) have been
      maintained in accordance with all applicable requirements, (B) if
      they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all
      requirements for such treatment, and (C) if they are intended to be
      funded and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book-reserved, as
      appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions, in each
      case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
      Washington Business.

                  (iv) None of the Washington Companies has any liability
      under or obligation to any Multiemployer Plan that will be included
      in the Washington Liabilities.

            (p) Labor Relations. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) none

seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to the Knowledge
of Conexant, threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor
Relations Board or any other domestic or foreign labor relations tribunal
or authority and (iii) except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Washington Business, there are no organizing activities, strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, arbitrations or grievances, or other labor
disputes pending or, to the Knowledge of Conexant, threatened against or
involving any of the Washington Companies.

            (q) Insurance. The Washington Companies maintain insurance
coverage with reputable insurers in such amounts and covering such risks as
is deemed reasonably appropriate for its business (taking into account the

            (r) Liens. No Liens exist on any of the Washington Assets,
except (i) Liens expressly set forth in the Washington Financial

from the value of, or impair the use of, such property in the Washington
Business, (iii) Liens for current taxes, assessments or governmental
charges or levies on property not yet due or which are being contested in
good faith and for which appropriate reserves in accordance with GAAP have
been created and (iv) Liens which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Washington Business.

            (s) Ownership of Alpha Common Stock. Conexant, together with
its affiliates and associates (as those terms are defined in Rule 12b-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act), is not the beneficial owner of 5% or
more of the outstanding shares of Alpha Common Stock. For purposes of this
Section 5.2(s), a Person shall be deemed to be the "beneficial owner" of
Alpha Common Stock if such Person, directly or indirectly, controls the
voting of such Alpha Common Stock or has any options, warrants, conversion
or other rights to acquire such Alpha Common Stock.

                 COVENANTS RELATING TO CONDUCT OF BUSINESS


            SECTION 6.1 COVENANTS OF ALPHA. During the period from the date
of this Agreement and continuing until the Effective Time, Alpha agrees as
to itself and its Subsidiaries that (except as required or otherwise
expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or Section 6.1

by a Governmental Entity or to the extent that Conexant shall otherwise
consent in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed):

            (a) Ordinary Course.

                  (i) Alpha and its Subsidiaries shall carry on their
      respective businesses in the ordinary course, in substantially the
      same manner as heretofore conducted, and shall use all reasonable
      efforts to preserve intact their present business organizations, keep
      available the services of their current officers and other key
      employees and preserve their relationships with customers, suppliers
      and others having business dealings with them to the end that their
      ongoing businesses shall not be materially impaired at the Effective
      Time; provided, however, that no action by Alpha or its Subsidiaries
      with respect to matters specifically addressed by any other provision
      of this Section 6.1 shall be deemed a breach of this Section
      6.1(a)(i) unless such action would constitute a breach of one or more
      of such other provisions.

            (d) Governing Documents. Except to the extent required to
comply with its obligations hereunder or with Applicable Laws, Alpha shall
not amend or propose to so amend its certificate of incorporation, by-laws
or other governing documents.

            (e) No Acquisitions. Alpha shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire by merger or

substantial portion of the assets of, or by any other manner, any business
or any corporation, partnership, limited liability entity, joint venture,
association or other business organization or division thereof or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any material assets (excluding the acquisition
of assets used in the operations of the business of Alpha and its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, which

continue activities otherwise permitted by this Agreement.

            (f) No Dispositions. Other than (i) internal reorganizations or

            (g) Investments; Indebtedness. Alpha shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) make any loans, advances or capital
contributions to, or investments in, any other Person, other than (A) loans

contained in this Section 6.1, Alpha will consult with Conexant in any
efforts by Alpha to obtain financing with respect to Alpha's obligations

reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.

            (i) Compensation. Except (x) as set forth in Section 6.1(c),
(y) as required by Applicable Laws or by the terms of any collective
bargaining agreement or other agreement currently in effect between Alpha
or any Subsidiary of Alpha and any executive officer or employee thereof or
(z) in the ordinary course of business, Alpha shall not increase the amount
of compensation or employee benefits of any director, officer or employee
of Alpha or any Subsidiary or business unit of Alpha, pay any pension,
retirement, savings or profit-sharing allowance to any employee that is not
required by any existing plan or agreement, enter into any Contract with
any of its employees regarding his or her employment, compensation or
benefits, increase or commit to increase any employee benefits, issue any
additional Alpha Stock Options, adopt or amend or make any commitment to

accelerate the vesting of, or the lapsing of restrictions with respect to,
any stock options or other stock-based compensation, except as required by
Applicable Laws or in the ordinary course of business or in accordance with
this Agreement, and any option committed to be granted or granted after the
date hereof shall not accelerate as a result of the approval or
consummation of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Alpha may, without Conexant's consent but
only after consultation with Conexant, enter into retention or other
similar agreements with employees of Alpha on terms, and with such number
of employees, as are substantially comparable to the severance or other
similar agreements to be entered into between the Washington Companies and
their employees.

            (j) Accounting Methods; Income Tax Elections. Except as

limit or otherwise restrict Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective affiliates or any successor thereto, or that would, after
the Effective Time, limit or restrict the Combined Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or any successor
thereto, from engaging or competing in any line of business in any
geographic area which agreements or arrangements, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Combined Company and its Subsidiaries following the Merger.

            (l) No Related Actions. Alpha will not, and will not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, agree or commit to do any of the foregoing actions.

            SECTION 6.2 COVENANTS OF CONEXANT AND WASHINGTON. During the

      with customers, suppliers and others having business dealings with
      them to the end that the Washington Business shall not be materially
      impaired at the Effective Time; provided, however, that no action by
      the Washington Companies with respect to matters specifically
      addressed by any other provision of this Section 6.2 shall be deemed
      a breach of this Section 6.2(a)(i) unless such action would
      constitute a breach of one or more of such other provisions.

      exercisable for, or any rights, warrants, calls or options to
      acquire, any such shares, or enter into any commitment, arrangement,
      undertaking or agreement with respect to any of the foregoing, other

      with the Conexant Rights Agreement.

                  (ii) Following the Time of Distribution and prior to the
      Effective Time, no member of the Washington Group will issue,

      wholly-owned Subsidiary of Washington.

            (d) Governing Documents. Except to the extent required to
comply with its obligations hereunder or under the Reorganization
Agreements or with Applicable Laws, Washington shall not amend or propose
to so amend its certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other governing
documents.

            (e) No Acquisitions. The Washington Companies shall not acquire

each case, that would be part of the Washington Business; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (x) internal reorganizations
or consolidations involving existing Subsidiaries of Conexant or (y) the
creation of new direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Conexant
organized to conduct or continue activities otherwise permitted by this
Agreement.

            (h) Tax-Free Qualification. Conexant and Washington shall use
their reasonable best efforts not to, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts not to permit any of their Subsidiaries to, take any action
(including any action otherwise permitted by this Section 6.2) that would

                                ARTICLE VII

                           ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS


            SECTION 7.1  PREPARATION OF PROXY STATEMENT; STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.

            (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, Alpha and Conexant shall prepare and Alpha shall file with the SEC
proxy materials which shall constitute the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
mailed to Alpha's stockholders in connection with the Alpha Stockholders
Meeting (such proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus") and Conexant and Alpha shall
prepare and Alpha shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-4 with respect to the issuance of Alpha Common Stock in the Merger (the
"Form S-4"). The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included in and will
constitute a part of the Form S-4 as Alpha's prospectus and will be mailed
to Conexant's stockholders as an Information Statement in connection with
the Distribution. The Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder. Alpha shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable after filing with the SEC, to have the Form S-4 declared
effective by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing
with the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. Alpha
shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide to
Conexant copies of any written comments and advise Conexant of any oral
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4
received from the SEC. Alpha shall provide Conexant with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the
Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus prior to filing such with the
SEC, and with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding
any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement
(including by incorporation by reference) to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Form S-4 shall be made without the approval of both Conexant and
Alpha, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Alpha
will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
be mailed to Alpha's stockholders, and Conexant will use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Conexant's
stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Alpha shall also take any action (other
than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now
so qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required
to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with
the issuance of Alpha Common Stock in the Merger and Alpha and Conexant
shall furnish all information concerning Alpha, Washington and Conexant and
the holders of Conexant Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. Alpha will advise Conexant, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become
effective, the issuance of any stop order with respect to the Form S-4, the
suspension of the qualification of the Alpha Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Alpha or Washington, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Alpha or Conexant which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the
extent required by Applicable Laws, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of Alpha and Conexant.

            (b) Alpha shall duly take all lawful action to call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders on a date
determined in accordance with the mutual agreement of Alpha and Conexant
(the "Alpha Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the
Required Alpha Vote with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall take all lawful action to solicit the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Required Alpha Vote, and
the Board of Directors of Alpha shall recommend approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders of Alpha to the effect as
set forth in Section 5.1(f) (the "Alpha Recommendation"), and shall not
withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify)
such recommendation (a "Change in the Alpha Recommendation"); provided,
however, that the Board of Directors of Alpha may make a Change in the
Alpha Recommendation pursuant to Section 7.5. Notwithstanding any Change in
the Alpha Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
stockholders of Alpha at the Alpha Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of
approving and adopting this Agreement and the Merger, and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve Alpha of such obligation.

            SECTION 7.2 COMBINED COMPANY BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT.
At or prior to the Effective Time, the parties will take all action
necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections 1.8 and 1.9.

            SECTION 7.3 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Upon reasonable notice, each
of Conexant and Alpha shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to
the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives of the other reasonable access during normal business
hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its books,
records, properties, plants and personnel (in the case of Conexant and its
Subsidiaries, only with respect to the Washington Business) and, during
such period, such party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to the other party all information concerning it and its business,
properties and personnel (as to Conexant and its Subsidiaries, only with
respect to the Washington Business) as such other party may reasonably
request; provided, however, that either party may restrict the foregoing
access to the extent that (i) any Applicable Laws or Contract requires such
party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information or (ii) the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a third party. The parties will hold any
such information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.3 in confidence in
accordance with, and will otherwise be subject to, the provisions of the
Mutual Confidentiality Agreement dated September 28, 2001 between Conexant
and Alpha (as it may be amended or supplemented, the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). Any investigation by either Alpha or Conexant shall not affect
the representations and warranties contained herein or the conditions to
the respective obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

            SECTION 7.4 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.

            (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing or causing to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and Applicable Laws to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i)
taking all reasonable actions to cause the conditions set forth in Article
VIII to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable; (ii) preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all

promptly as practicable the Tax Ruling, all Alpha Necessary Consents and
Conexant Necessary Consents and all other consents, waivers, licenses,
orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and
clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the
"Required Approvals") and (iii) taking all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain all Required Approvals. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as

Applicable Laws or by such authorities and to use reasonable best efforts
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act and the receipt of the Required Approvals under such
other Applicable Laws or from such authorities as soon as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.4 shall require
any of Alpha and its Subsidiaries, Conexant and its Subsidiaries,
Washington and its Subsidiaries or the Combined Company and its
Subsidiaries to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets of
Alpha, Conexant, Washington, the Combined Company or their respective
Subsidiaries (including the capital stock of any Subsidiary) or conduct
their business in a specified manner, or agree to do so, whether as a
condition to obtaining any approval from a Governmental Entity or any other
Person or for any other reason, if such sale, holding separate or other
disposition or the conduct of their business in a specified manner is not
conditioned on the Closing or, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Combined
Company and its Subsidiaries, after giving effect to the Merger (or, only
with respect to Conexant and its Subsidiaries, to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Conexant and its Subsidiaries, after giving effect to the
Distribution).

            (b) Each of Alpha, on the one hand, and Conexant and
Washington, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 7.4(a) to obtain all Required Approvals, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given
by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental Entity or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other
Person, and to the extent appropriate or permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or
such other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

            (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
the parties contained in Section 7.4(a) and Section 7.4(b), if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding
by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
any Applicable Laws, or if any statute, rule, regulation, executive order,
decree, injunction or administrative order is enacted, entered, promulgated
or enforced by a Governmental Entity which would make the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prohibit
or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Conexant and Alpha shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable
best efforts, including, subject to the last sentence of Section 7.4(a),
selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of any assets of Alpha or
its Subsidiaries or the Washington Companies (including the capital stock
of any Subsidiary) or conducting their business (in the case of Conexant,
only with respect to the Washington Business) in a specified manner, or
agreeing to do so, to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent,
that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
have such statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or
administrative order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 7.4 shall limit a party's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or Section 9.1(c) so long as such
party has complied with its obligations under this Section 7.4.

            (d) Each of Alpha, Conexant and Washington shall cooperate with
each other in obtaining opinions of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
LLP, counsel to Alpha, and Chadbourne & Parke LLP, counsel to Conexant and
Washington, to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(c) and
Section 8.3(c). In connection therewith, each of Alpha and Conexant shall
deliver to such counsel customary representation letters in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel.

            SECTION 7.5 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.

            (a) Without limiting Alpha's other obligations under this
Agreement (including under Article VI hereof), Alpha agrees that from and
after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees,
agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or

principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or
other similar agreement related to any Alpha Acquisition Proposal.

            (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Alpha Acquisition
Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person with respect
to (A) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Alpha or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (as
defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC), (B) any purchase or
sale or other disposition of 20% or more of the consolidated assets
(including stock of its Subsidiaries) of Alpha and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (C) any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer
for, or similar transaction with respect to, the equity securities of Alpha
that, if consummated, would result in any Person (or the stockholders of
such Person) beneficially owning securities representing 20% or more of the
total voting power of Alpha (or of the surviving parent entity in such
transaction) or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, including in the case
of each of clauses (A) through (C), any single or multi-step transaction or
series of related transactions (other than a proposal or offer made by
Conexant or a Subsidiary thereof).

            (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Alpha or its Board of Directors shall be permitted to (i) to the extent
applicable, comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to an Alpha Acquisition Proposal, (ii) effect a
Change in the Alpha Recommendation or (iii) engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person in response to
an unsolicited bona fide written Alpha Acquisition Proposal by any such
Person (which has not been withdrawn) in order to be informed with respect
thereto in order to make any determination permitted in clause (ii), if and
only to the extent that, in any such case referred to in clause (ii) or
(iii), (A) the Alpha Stockholders Meeting shall not have occurred, (B) it
has received an unsolicited bona fide written Alpha Acquisition Proposal
from a third party (which has not been withdrawn) and (x) in the case of
clause (ii) above, its Board of Directors concludes in good faith that such
Alpha Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Alpha Proposal and (y) in
the case of clause (iii) above, its Board of Directors concludes in good
faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Alpha Acquisition
Proposal would constitute a Superior Alpha Proposal, (C) its Board of
Directors, after consultation with its outside counsel, determines in good
faith that such action is required by its fiduciary duties to stockholders
under Applicable Laws as a result of such Alpha Acquisition Proposal, (D)
in the case of clause (ii) above, it shall provide Conexant immediate
written notice of such action, (E) prior to providing any information or
data to any Person in connection with an Alpha Acquisition Proposal by any
such Person, it receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms substantially the same as the Confidentiality
Agreement and (F) prior to providing any information or data to any Person
or entering into discussions or negotiations with any Person, it notifies
Conexant promptly of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any
such information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations
sought to be initiated or continued with, such Person or any of its
representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of
such Person and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries,
proposals or offers, and furnishes to Conexant a copy of any such written
inquiry, proposal or offer. Alpha agrees that it will promptly keep
Conexant informed of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers
and the status and terms of any such discussions or negotiations and will
promptly provide Conexant with any such written proposals or offers. Alpha
agrees that it will, and will cause its officers, directors and
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Alpha
Acquisition Proposal, and request the return or destruction of all
non-public information furnished in connection therewith. Alpha agrees that
it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform its directors,
officers, key employees, agents and representatives of the obligations
undertaken by Alpha in this Section 7.5. Nothing in this Section 7.5 shall
(x) permit Alpha to terminate this Agreement (except as specifically
provided in Article IX) or (y) affect any other obligation of Alpha or
Conexant under this Agreement. Alpha shall not submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Alpha Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

            (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Alpha Proposal"
means a bona fide written Alpha Acquisition Proposal (for purposes of this
definition of "Superior Alpha Proposal", references to 20% in the
definition of "Alpha Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references
to 50%) made by a Person other than a party hereto which is on terms which
the Board of Directors of Alpha in good faith concludes (following receipt
of the advice of its financial advisors), taking into account, among other
things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal
and the Person making the proposal, (x) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable to its stockholders (in their capacities
as stockholders), from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (y) is reasonably likely to be
completed.

            (e) Without limiting Conexant's other obligations under this
Agreement (including under Article VI hereof), Conexant agrees that from
and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries)

knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a
transaction to effect, any Washington Acquisition Proposal (as defined

Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person with respect
to any purchase or sale or other disposition of 20% or more of the
consolidated assets (including stock of subsidiaries) of the Washington
Business, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of
related transactions (other than a proposal or offer made by Alpha or a
Subsidiary thereof).

            SECTION 7.6 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS.

            (a) Continuation and Comparability of Benefits. Subject to the
Employee Matters Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, the employee
benefit plans established or assumed by Washington pursuant to the Employee
Matters Agreement and the Alpha Plans in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and at the Effective Time shall remain in effect with respect to
Washington Participants (as defined in the Employee Matters Agreement) and
employees and former employees of Alpha and its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Combined Company Employees"), covered by such plans at the Effective
Time, until such time as the Combined Company shall otherwise determine,
subject to Applicable Laws and the terms of such plans. Prior to the
Effective Time, or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, Conexant
and Alpha shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the
Washington Plans and the Alpha Plans with a view towards developing
appropriate new benefit plans for Combined Company Employees. It is the
intention of Conexant and Alpha, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Laws, to develop new benefit plans prior to the Effective Time or as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time which, among other
things, (i) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially
equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including
duties, geographic location, tenure, qualifications and abilities and (ii)
do not discriminate between Combined Company Employees who were covered by
Washington Plans, on the one hand, and those covered by Alpha Plans, on the
other, at the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be
interpreted as preventing the Combined Company from amending, modifying or
terminating any employee benefit plans established or assumed by Washington
pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement or any Alpha Plan or other
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding, in accordance with its
terms and Applicable Laws.

            (b) Pre-Existing Limitations; Deductibles; Service Credit. With
respect to any employee benefit plans in which any Combined Company
Employees who were employees of Conexant or Alpha (or their Subsidiaries)
prior to the Effective Time first become eligible to participate on or
after the Effective Time, and in which the Combined Company Employees did
not participate prior to the Effective Time (the "New Combined Company
Plans"), the Combined Company shall: (A) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Combined Company Employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Combined Company Plans in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except
to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods
would apply under the analogous Washington Plan or Alpha Plan, as the case
may be; (B) provide each Combined Company Employee and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
the Effective Time under a Washington Plan or an Alpha Plan (to the same
extent such credit was given under the analogous employee benefit plan
prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under any New Combined Company Plans in which
such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time; and
(C) recognize all service of the Combined Company Employees with Conexant
and Alpha, and their respective affiliates, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting credit, entitlement to benefits and, other than with
respect to defined benefit pension plans, benefit accrual, in any New
Combined Company Plan in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, to the extent such service is taken
into account under the applicable New Combined Company Plan; provided that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication
of benefits.

            SECTION 7.7 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Section 9.2(c) of
this Agreement and Section 4.09 of the Distribution Agreement, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses (as defined below) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, except Expenses
incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Form
S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which shall be shared equally by
Alpha and Conexant. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" means all
out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto
and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with
or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Form S-4 and
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the solicitation of stockholder approval
and all other matters related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

           SECTION 7.8  DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.

            (a) The Combined Company shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless,
and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors,
officers and employees of Alpha and its Subsidiaries (in all of their
capacities as such), to the same extent such persons are indemnified or
have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement
by Alpha pursuant to Alpha's certificate of incorporation, by-laws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with
any such directors, officers and employees of Alpha and its Subsidiaries
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) and (ii) cause to be maintained for a period of six years after the
Effective Time the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Alpha (provided
that the Combined Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured than the current policies
maintained by Alpha) with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in
no event shall the Combined Company be required to expend in any one year
an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums (on a per capita basis)
currently paid by Alpha for such insurance; and, provided, further, that if
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Combined Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

            (b) The Combined Company shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless,
and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors,
officers and employees of the Washington Companies (in all of their
capacities as such), to the same extent such persons are indemnified or
have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement
by Conexant pursuant to Conexant's certificate of incorporation, by-laws
and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof
with any such directors, officers and employees of the Washington Companies
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) and (ii) maintain in effect for each of the applicable persons
referred to in clause (i) for a period of six years after the Effective
Time policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance of at least the same coverage and amounts as, and
containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured than, the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by Conexant, with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the Combined
Company be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200%
of the annual premiums (on a per capita basis) currently paid by Conexant
for such insurance; and, provided, further, that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Combined Company shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

            (c) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended to be for
the benefit of and shall be enforceable by each indemnified or insured
party referred to above in this Section 7.8.

            SECTION 7.9 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Alpha and Conexant each shall
use reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each
party shall use reasonable best efforts (i) to ensure that all press
releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications
plan, and (ii) unless otherwise required by Applicable Laws or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange or automated quotation system, to consult with each
other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practicable,
otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

            SECTION 7.10 ACCOUNTING MATTERS.

            (a) Alpha shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be
delivered to Conexant two letters from Alpha's independent public
accountants, one dated approximately the date on which the Form S-4 shall

Conexant and Washington, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Conexant and reasonably customary in scope and substance for comfort
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Form S-4.

            (b) Conexant shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be
delivered to Alpha two letters from Washington's independent public

            SECTION 7.12 AFFILIATES. Not less than 45 days prior to the
Effective Time, Conexant shall deliver to Alpha a letter identifying all
persons who, in the judgment of Conexant, may be deemed at the time this
Agreement is submitted for approval by Conexant as the sole stockholder of
Washington, "affiliates" of Washington for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act and applicable SEC rules and regulations, and such list
shall be updated as necessary to reflect changes from the date of delivery
thereof. Conexant shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each person
identified on such list to deliver to Alpha not less than 30 days prior to
the Effective Time, a written agreement substantially in the form attached

transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is or

Exchange Act with respect to Alpha to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance
with applicable SEC rules and regulations and interpretations of the SEC
staff.

            SECTION 7.14 TAKEOVER STATUTES. If any "fair price",
"moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover
statute or regulation shall become applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Conexant, Alpha and Washington and their
respective Boards of Directors shall use all reasonable efforts to grant
such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as

Board of Directors of the terminating party or parties, and except as

in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Alpha:

                  (a) by mutual written consent of Conexant and Alpha;

                  (b) by either Conexant or Alpha if the Effective Time
      shall not have occurred on or before September 30, 2002 (the
      "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate
      this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to
      any party whose failure to fulfill in any material respect any
      obligation under this Agreement (including such party's obligations
      set forth in Section 7.4) has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
      failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the Termination
      Date;

                  (c) by either Conexant or Alpha if any Governmental
      Entity (i) shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
      other action (which such party shall have used its reasonable best
      efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as applicable, in accordance with
      Section 7.4) permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
      prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
      order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and

                  (d) by either Conexant or Alpha if the approval by the
      stockholders of Alpha required for the consummation of the Merger
      shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the

      such action referred to in clause (A), (B), (C) or (D)), in each
      case, whether or not permitted by the terms hereof, (ii) Alpha shall
      have breached its obligations under this Agreement by reason of a
      failure to call and hold the Alpha Stockholders Meeting in accordance

      published, sent or given, a statement that Alpha recommends rejection
      of such tender or exchange offer;

                  (f) by Conexant, if Alpha shall have breached or failed
      to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
      agreements contained in this Agreement, such that the conditions set
      forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) are not capable of being
      satisfied on or before the Termination Date; or

                  (g) by Alpha, if Conexant or Washington shall have
      breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
      covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, such that
      the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) are not
      capable of being satisfied on or before the Termination Date.

            SECTION 9.2  EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

            (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either
Conexant or Alpha as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of Alpha, Conexant or Washington or their respective officers or
directors under this Agreement, except that (i) the provisions of Section
5.1(m), Section 5.2(k), the second sentence of Section 7.3, Section 7.7,
this Section 9.2 and Article X shall survive such termination, and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including Section 7.7), none of Alpha, Conexant or Washington shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

            (b) If:

                (i) (A) (x) either Conexant or Alpha shall terminate this
      Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b) without the Alpha Stockholder
      Meeting having occurred or pursuant to Section 9.1(d) or (y) Conexant
      shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f) as a result
      of any intentional breach or failure to perform by Alpha (unless
      covered by clause (ii) below), and

                    (B) at any time after the date of this Agreement and
      before such termination an Alpha Acquisition Proposal shall have been
      publicly announced or, in the case of termination of this Agreement
      pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or Section 9.1(f), publicly announced or
      otherwise communicated to the senior management, Board of Directors
      or stockholders of Alpha, and

                    (C) within nine months of such termination Alpha or any
      of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect
      to, or consummates, any Alpha Acquisition Proposal (for purposes of
      this clause (C), references to 20% in the definition of "Alpha
      Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50%); or

                  (ii) Conexant shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
      Section 9.1(e);

then Alpha shall promptly, but in no event later than the date of such
termination (or in the case of clause (i), if later, the date Alpha or its
Subsidiary enters into such agreement with respect to or consummates such
Alpha Acquisition Proposal), pay Conexant an amount equal to Forty-Five
Million dollars ($45,000,000), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds.

            (c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Conexant or Alpha fails promptly
to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 9.2, and, in order to obtain
such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment
against such party for the fee set forth in this Section 9.2, such party
shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amount of the fee from the date such payment is required to be made
until the date such payment is actually made at the prime rate of Citibank,
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. The
parties agree that any remedy or amount payable pursuant to this Section
9.2 shall not preclude any other remedy or amount payable hereunder, and
shall not be an exclusive remedy, for any willful breach of any provision
of this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.3 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders of Alpha,
but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange or automated
quotation system requires further approval by such stockholders without
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

            SECTION 9.4 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of other parties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions of other parties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.
