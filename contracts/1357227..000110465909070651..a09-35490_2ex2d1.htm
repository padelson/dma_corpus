 THE MERGER

  



  

Section 2.1 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the BC Act and Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving

wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

  



  

Section 2.2 CLOSING. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with Section 8.1 and subject to the terms and conditions of this

the offices of Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York at 10:00
a.m., local time, as promptly as practicable, which shall be no later than
the fifth Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (by the party
entitled to grant such waiver and to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
of each of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by action at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing),
or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in
writing. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein
as the " _Closing Date_." No earlier than two Business Days prior to the
Closing, upon the written request of Parent, the Company will take the

subsequent occurrence of the Effective Time); it being understood and agreed
by the parties that the contents of Section 2.2 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule may be amended by Parent after the date of this Agreement (with the
consent of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld) to take into account
any additional capital gain or income producing contracts that are identified
by Parent and the Company pursuant to Section 6.2(d) of this Agreement.

Corporate Affairs (the " _Registrar_ ") and the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ "), and make all other filings
or recordings required pursuant to Section 171 of the BC Act or by Delaware
Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Articles of Merger are duly registered by the Registrar and filed
with the Delaware Secretary, or at such later time as the parties shall agree
(subject to the requirements of the BC Act and Delaware Law) and as shall be
set forth in the Articles of Merger (such date and time as the Merger becomes
effective is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 2.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The terms and conditions of the Merger
and its effects shall be as provided in this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation, in so far as

  



        
   

  



  

is consistent with its Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association,
shall have all rights, privileges, immunities, powers, objects and purposes
of each of the Company and Merger Sub, all the assets of every description
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, claims, liabilities
and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, claims,
liabilities and obligations of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided
under the BC Act and Delaware Law.

  



  

Section 2.5 MEMORANDUM OF ASSOCIATION AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF THE
SURVIVING CORPORATION. At the Effective Time, the Memorandum of Association

association of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

  



  

Section 2.6 DIRECTORS. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be

ARTICLE III 
  
 CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; 
 TREATMENT OF EQUITY AWARDS

  



  

Section 3.1 EFFECT ON SHARES. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any
holder of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) CONVERSION OF COMPANY ORDINARY SHARES. Subject to Section 3.1(d), each
ordinary share, no par value, of the Company issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares
collectively, " _Company Ordinary Shares_ " or " _Shares_ " and each, a "
_Share_ "), other than any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the extent
provided, in Section 3.1(b)) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined, and to
the extent provided, in Section 3.1(e)), shall, from and after the Effective
Time, thereupon be converted into a right to receive $19.75 in cash, without
interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "); and all Shares that have
been thus converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Section 3.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease
to exist and no longer be outstanding and the holders of such Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
such certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in respect thereof) or,
for Book-Entry Shares, upon the updating of the register of shareholders of
the Company, in each case in accordance with this Article III.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) PARENT AND MERGER SUB OWNED SHARES; TREASURY SHARES. Each Share that is
owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary thereof immediately prior to the Effective
Time or held by the Company as treasury shares (in each case, other than any
such Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ")
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) CONVERSION OF MERGER SUB SHARES. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable ordinary share, no par value, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall procure to issue the holders thereof certificates
representing the number of ordinary shares of the Surviving Corporation into
which such shares of Merger Sub were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(d) ADJUSTMENTS. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Company
Ordinary Shares shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period (it being understood
that the right of the Company to effect any of the foregoing shall be subject
to Section 6.1 hereof), the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted
to provide to the holders of Shares, Company Stock Options and Restricted
Stock Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(e) DISSENTING SHARES. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Dissenting
Shares_ " means Shares held by holders who duly exercise their right of
dissent in relation to the Merger and in accordance with the provisions of
Section 179 of the BC Act. At or from the Effective Time, all Dissenting
Shares shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist or be
outstanding, and each holder of certificates representing Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto (including any right to
receive such holderÂ’s portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 3.1(a) hereof), except for such rights as are granted under
Section 179 of the BC Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any holder of
Dissenting Shares fails before the Company Meeting or at such meeting
but before the vote, to give written objection to the action and of its
intention to dissent from the Merger under Section 179 of the BC Act, then
the rights of such holder to be paid "fair value" pursuant to Section 179
of the BC Act shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting Shares shall entitle
their holder to receive the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) hereof. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any notice received by the Company of any shareholderÂ’s intent to
exercise dissenterÂ’s rights pursuant to Section 179 of the BC Act, the
withdrawal of any such notice and any other documents served upon the Company
pursuant to Section 179 of the BC Act. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as
otherwise required by an order, decree, ruling or injunction of a court of
competent jurisdiction, make any payment with respect to any such exercise of

  



        
   

  



  

dissenterÂ’s rights or offer to settle or settle any such rights for an amount
higher than the Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 3.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

  



  

(a) PAYING AGENT. At or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) designate
the CompanyÂ’s stock transfer agent (or an Affiliate thereof) or a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and (ii) enter into a paying
agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
with such Paying Agent, to serve as Paying Agent.  At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares, cash
in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting
Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or
effective affidavits of loss accompanied by any bond required by Section
3.2(g) in lieu thereof) and non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry
(" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this Article III
(such cash, and any proceeds thereon, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

  



  

(b) PAYMENT PROCEDURES.

  



  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than (x) two Business Days following the Effective Time with
respect to Cede and Co. and (y) five Business Days following the Effective Time
with respect to all other holders), Parent will instruct the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record whose Shares were converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, (A) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss
and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss accompanied by any bond required by Section
3.2(g) in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify
that are consistent with the terms of this Agreement), and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss accompanied by any bond required by Section 3.2(g) in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
or the receipt of an "agentÂ’s message" by the Paying Agent (or such evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor an amount (subject
to any applicable withholding Tax as specified in Section 3.2(b)(iii)) equal
to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holderÂ’s
properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-

  



        
   

  



  

Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon the surrender of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, any amounts payable
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and is
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence to the Surviving CorporationÂ’s reasonable satisfaction that
any applicable Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender and in accordance with the terms
hereof the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the
amount of the aggregate Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article III.

  



  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct or withhold, from
the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Restricted Stock Units or Company Stock Options such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any applicable
provision of U.S. state, U.S. local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
deducted, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Restricted
Stock Units or Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made.

  



  

(c) CLOSING OF REGISTER OF MEMBERS. At the Effective Time, the register
of members of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the register of members of the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, other than to settle transfers of Shares that occurred
prior the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
proper amount pursuant to this Article III, subject to applicable Law in the
case of Dissenting Shares.

  



  

(d) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand,
and any former holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for payment of such holderÂ’s portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their Shares.

  



        
   

  



  

(e) NO LIABILITY.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered from the Exchange Fund to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If
any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which the portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable to the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
pursuant to this Article III would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore complied
with this Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of his or her claim in respect of the portion of the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share.

  



  

(f) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND.  The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such investments shall be in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, (ii) commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation, respectively, or (iii)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankerÂ’s acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available).
If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Exchange Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be
income of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(g) LOST CERTIFICATES. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by
such Person of a bond in customary or reasonable amount as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate an
amount of cash equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 3.3 TREATMENT OF EQUITY AWARDS.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each option (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") to
purchase Shares, including a Company Stock Option granted under the CompanyÂ’s
Amended and Restated 2004 Key Executive Stock Option Plan and 2007 Incentive
Compensation Plan (collectively, the " _Company Incentive Plans_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether
vested or unvested) will be cancelled and the holder thereof shall receive in
consideration for such cancellation and in full settlement of such Company
Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of
Company Ordinary Shares

  



        
   

  



  

previously subject to such Company Stock Option and (B) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of the
applicable Company Stock Option, less any required withholding Taxes (the "
_Option Consideration_ "). The Option Consideration shall be paid by
the Company through its payroll system (to the extent practicable), or if
not practicable checks for such payment shall be drawn by the Surviving
Corporation and sent by overnight courier to the holderÂ’s last address on the
CompanyÂ’s records, in each case, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than three Business Days following the
Effective Time). At the Effective Time, Parent shall pay the aggregate
Option Consideration owed to all holders of Company Stock Options to an
account or accounts designated by the Company by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof each restricted stock unit (a " _Restricted
Stock Unit_ ") granted under the Company Incentive Plans, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested), will
cease to represent a right or award with respect to Company Ordinary Shares
and will be cancelled and be of no further force and effect and the holder
thereof shall receive in consideration for such cancellation and in full
settlement of such Restricted Stock Unit, an amount in cash equal to the
product of (A) the number of Restricted Stock Units and (B) the Merger
Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes (" _RSU Consideration_ ").
The RSU Consideration shall be paid by the Company through its payroll system
(to the extent practicable), or if not practicable checks for such payment
shall be drawn by the Surviving Corporation and sent by overnight courier to
the holderÂ’s last address on the CompanyÂ’s records, in each case, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
three Business Days following the Effective Time). At the Effective Time,
Parent shall pay the aggregate RSU Consideration owed to all holders of
Restricted Stock Units to an account or accounts designated by the Company by
wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.3, the Company
will terminate any and all equity-based plans maintained by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, subject to and effective as of the Effective Time.
The Company will provide Parent evidence of such termination pursuant to
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of
Directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of such
resolutions will be subject to review and reasonable approval of Parent).
The Company will take all reasonable actions necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 3.3.

  



  

(d) All amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.3(b)
shall be subject to any required withholding Taxes or proof of eligibility
of exemption therefrom.

Agreement, (x) any disclosures that contain cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking statements, (y) any disclosures set forth in

  



        
   

  



  

any section of a Company SEC Document entitled "risk factors" or constituting
"forward-looking statements" or any other similar or comparable sections of
such filings, and (z) the financial statements and notes thereto included in
any such Company SEC Document), in each case such that the relevance of such
disclosure in qualifying the representations and warranties of the Company is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure (collectively, the "
_Permitted SEC Disclosure_ "), or (ii) disclosed in the corresponding
numbered sections of the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or any Permitted SEC Disclosure
shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this
Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its
face), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

  



  

Section 4.1 QUALIFICATION; ORGANIZATION. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is (a) a legal entity duly organized and validly existing under
the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted, and (b) qualified to do business and is in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except, in
each case, where the failure to be so organized, existing, to have such power
and authority, or to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the CompanyÂ’s
Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association and of the analogous
constitutive and organizational documents of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries, each
as amended through the date of this Agreement. The CompanyÂ’s Memorandum
of Association and Articles of Association are in full force and effect.

documents, and none of its Subsidiaries is in material violation of the
provisions of its organizational documents.

  



  

Section 4.2 OWNERSHIP OF SUBSIDIARIES. Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule accurately sets forth for each Subsidiary of the Company: its name,
place of incorporation or formation and, if not wholly-owned directly or

Agreement of all capital stock or other equity interests issued thereby. All
of the outstanding equity interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of any Liens (other
than Permitted Liens), and none of such outstanding equity interests has been

call right or right of first refusal. There are no outstanding
options, warrants, calls, stock appreciation rights or other rights or
commitments or any other agreements of any character relating to the sale,
issuance or voting of, or the granting of rights to acquire any equity
interests of, any Subsidiary of the Company, or any securities or other
instruments convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the right to
purchase any equity interests of any Subsidiary of the Company. The Company
does not own any capital stock, membership interests, security or
other interest in any Person other than of its Subsidiaries, each of which is
set forth in Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company is authorized to issue
101,000,000 Company Ordinary Shares, of which (A) 22,161,456 Company Ordinary

granted in compliance with all applicable securities and other
applicable Laws, and (ii) duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any preemptive
or similar rights, purchase option, call right, right of first refusal or

Plans, with applicable Law, and with the applicable provisions of the
CompanyÂ’s Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association as in effect
at the applicable time, and all such Company Stock Options are accurately
disclosed as required under applicable Law in the Company SEC Reports,
including the financial statements contained therein or attached thereto (if
amended or superseded by a filing with the SEC made prior to the date of this
Agreement, as so amended or superseded).

  



  

(c) Expect as set forth in Section 4.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is contractually obligated to
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its outstanding shares or any
voting or equity securities or interests of any of its Subsidiaries. No

and correct list of all Persons who, as of the date of this Agreement, are
eligible to receive Shares in respect of outstanding Restricted Stock Units

a board resolution adopted pursuant to Section 170 of the BC Act and
the CompanyÂ’s organizational documents and determined that this Agreement

constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that
such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to creditorsÂ’ rights and general principles of equity (whether
considered in a proceeding at Law or equity). The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the Company Ordinary Shares, voting together as
a single class, that were present at a shareholders meeting and entitled to

such authorizations, consents, approvals or filings that, if not obtained or
made, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.6 ABSENCE OF DEFAULTS, CONFLICTS, ETC. The execution and delivery
by the Company of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and compliance
with the provisions hereof will not, (i) except as set forth on Section
4.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
rise to a right of, termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation under, any legally-binding loan, guarantee of Indebtedness or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement,
contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right, license,
arrangement or other obligation (whether written or oral) (each, a "
_Contract_ "), to which the Company or any

violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, Lien
or other circumstance that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.7 REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

  



  

(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished all forms, documents and
reports (the " _Company SEC Documents_ ") required to be filed or furnished by
it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") between

case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to
any other adjustments described therein including the notes thereto), and

control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15
and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 and Rule
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The CompanyÂ’s disclosure controls and

reasonably designed to provide reasonable assurance that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated
to the CompanyÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required
pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(b) The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the CompanyÂ’s auditors and the audit committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect
the CompanyÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, known to the management of
the Company that involves management or other employees, in each case who
have a significant role in the CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial
reporting. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the CompanyÂ’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the CompanyÂ’s disclosure controls and procedures as of October

and procedures were effective as of October 3, 2009, at the reasonable
assurance level.

past practice since October 3, 2009, and (c) for liabilities or obligations
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet (or
the notes thereto) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than those that
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
Section 4.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements or
obligations under any interest rate or currency cap, swap, collar, hedging or

respective properties or assets and have not received any written notice of
any non-compliance, default or violation of such Laws or Orders, except in

(the " _FDA_ ") promulgated thereunder) necessary for the Company and its
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to
carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Company
Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Company Permits
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and
effect would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are, and at all times since the IPO Date have been, (i) in
compliance with the terms and conditions of the Company Permits, and (ii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
of any violation of the terms or conditions of the Company Permits, or
alleging the failure to hold or obtain any Company Permits required to own,
lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses
as they are now being conducted, except in the case of each of (i) and (ii)
above any non-compliance, violations or failures that would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received written notice that any of the Company Permits

Agreement, the Company has not received written notice of any investigation

Company Material Adverse Effect, and (b) except as set forth in Section
4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no actions, notices,
suits, grievances, claims, arbitrations or

  



        
   

  



  

proceedings pending (or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened) against
or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective properties, officers or directors or for which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is required to indemnify a third party at Law or in
equity before, and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of or before,
any Governmental Authority, in each case, that would (i) if adversely
determined, reasonably be expected to result in any payment by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in excess of $1.0 million or (ii) have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.12 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as set forth in
Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, from July 5, 2009 to the
date of this Agreement, except as otherwise specifically contemplated

Section 6.2 INVESTIGATION.

  



  

(a) The Company shall afford to Parent and to its officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors,
investment bankers and other agents, advisors and
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice by Parent,
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ properties, contracts, books and records and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to furnish promptly to
Parent such additional financial and operating data and other information
customarily prepared prior to the date of this Agreement as to its and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ respective businesses and properties as Parent or its
Representatives may from time to time reasonably request (including using its
reasonable best efforts to cause its accountants to cooperate with Parent and
its Representatives in having the right to examine all working
papers pertaining to all financial statements prepared by such accountants,
and _provided_  that no environmental sampling shall be conducted without
express authorization from the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to permit
any access to inspection or disclose any information to Parent or its
Representatives that would cause a violation of any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party ( _provided_ that the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
obtain waivers under such Contracts or, to the extent permissible, implement
requisite procedures to enable the provision of reasonable access without
violating such Contract), would be reasonably likely to result in a loss of
privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or would constitute a
violation of applicable Laws, including the HSR Act, _provided_ that the
maximum amount of information that can be disclosed without having any of
such effects shall be disclosed to Parent. Parent hereby agrees that
it shall treat any such information in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), dated as of
October 14, 2009, between the Company and Parent; _provided_ that the Company
hereby waives the terms and conditions in the Confidentiality Agreement
insofar as such terms limit the individuals who can receive information from
the Company and insofar as such terms prohibit the Parent or any of its
Affiliates from contacting any employee, customer or supplier of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall
Parent or any of its Affiliates contact any employee, customer or supplier of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the CompanyÂ’s prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.  Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any activities pursuant to this Section 6.2(a)
in such a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other party of
(i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to
cause any condition to the obligations of the other party to effect the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied, (ii) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of the other party to
effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
not to be satisfied, (iii) the receipt of any notice or other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, (iv) the receipt of any notice or other communication
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions

  



        
   

  



  

contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and (v) its learning of
any actions, investigations or proceedings commenced against, or affecting,
such party that, if they were pending on the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or that relate
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to provide
notice pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) shall not be deemed to be a breach
of this Agreement for purposes of Section 7.2(b) or Section 7.3(b).

  



  

(c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to Section 6.2(b) shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the parties
receiving such notice. No investigation by any party or its Representatives
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
other parties set forth herein.

  



  

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in identifying any Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incorporated in the British
Virgin Islands, Hungary, Malta or any other tax preference jurisdiction is a
party that may result in any adverse Tax consequences under the
French controlled foreign company rules.

  



  

Section 6.3 NO SOLICITATION.

  



  

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates (including holders of 10% or
greater of the outstanding Company Ordinary Shares),
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors, and investment
bankers not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission of any Company Alternative
Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any nonpublic information (or grant access to any of the properties,
assets or nonpublic records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, or in
furtherance of, any Company Alternative Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions
with any Person with respect to any Company Alternative Proposal, except to
notify such Person as to the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.3,
(iv) withhold, withdraw or modify (or publicly propose or announce any
intention or desire to withhold, withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation, (v) agree to, accept, approve, endorse or
recommend (or publicly propose or announce any intention to agree to, accept,
approve, endorse or recommend) any Company Alternative Proposal, (vi) enter
into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement or
commitment providing for any Company Alternative Proposal (except for
confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 6.3(b)), (vii) enter into
any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, or breach its obligations under this
Agreement, or (viii) agree to do any of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_
, that it is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the
Board of Directors of the Company permitted under Section 6.3(b), Section
6.3(c), Section 6.3(d), Section 6.3(e) or Section 8.1(g) shall not be deemed
to be a breach or violation of this Section 6.3(a).

  



        
   

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.3(a), if the
Company receives an unsolicited written Company Alternative Proposal (other
than as a result of its material breach of Section 6.3(a)) that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
the CompanyÂ’s outside legal and financial advisors, constitutes or would be
reasonably likely to result, after the taking of any of the actions
referred to below, in a Company Superior Proposal, the Company may, or the
Company may direct its Representatives to, (i) contact the third party making
such Company Alternative Proposal or its Representatives to clarify the terms
and conditions of such proposal; (ii) furnish nonpublic information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the third party (and
its Representatives) making such Company Alternative Proposal, if, and only
if, (A) all such information provided to such third party has previously been
made available to Parent or is made available to Parent concurrently with
such information being provided to such third party and (B) prior to
so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party
an executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement may exclude from any standstill restriction the
making by such third party of a Company Alternative Proposal in accordance
with the terms of this Section 6.3 with the consent of the Board of Directors
of the Company); and (iii) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the third party (and its Representatives) with respect to the Company
Alternative Proposal.

  



  

(c) From and after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
promptly, and in any event within 48 hours following receipt thereof,
advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly,
of any Company Alternative Proposal (including any material modification to
such proposal) and any determination by the Board of Directors of the Company
under Section 6.3(b), which notification shall identify the offeror and
include a copy of any such proposal, if it is in writing, or a written
summary of the material terms and conditions of the Company Alternative
Proposal.  In addition, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on
a reasonably current basis, and in any event within 48 hours following
receipt thereof, with respect to any material development relating to such
proposal, including the entering into discussions or negotiations and the
results of such discussions or negotiations and any changes in material terms
or conditions based thereon. In the event of any Company Change in
Recommendation, the Company shall provide Parent with the CompanyÂ’s
shareholder lists and, following a Company Change in Recommendation, Parent
may contact the CompanyÂ’s shareholders and prospective investors
without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 6.7, subject to
ParentÂ’s compliance with applicable Law.

  



  

(d) The Board of Directors of the Company may (A) change, withhold or
withdraw (or modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent) the Company
Recommendation, or publicly propose to change, withhold or withdraw
(or modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent) the Company
Recommendation, or (B) recommend or approve, or propose publicly to recommend
or approve, any Company Alternative Proposal that constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal (any such action, a " _Company Change in Recommendation_
") if:

  



  

(i) the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal and financial advisors, that
the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Company
Change in

  



        
   

  



  

Recommendation is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’
exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders under
applicable Law;

  



  

(ii) the Company has provided Parent six Business DaysÂ’ written notice
advising Parent of the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior
Proposal and its intention to make a Company Change in Recommendation (a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (it being understood and agreed that no
such notice is required for a Company Change in Recommendation not made in
response to or as a result of a Company Superior Proposal); and

  



  

(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company has taken into account any
revised proposal made by Parent to the Company within six Business Days
of providing Parent with a Recommendation Change Notice (the "
_Recommendation Change_ ___Notice Period_ ") and again has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that the
proposal from the third party that was described in the Recommendation Change
Notice remains a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ that, if the third
party whose proposal was described in the Recommendation Change Notice
modifies or amends such proposal to increase the consideration to be paid or
amends other material terms during the Recommendation Change Notice Period, a
new six Business Day period shall begin for purposes of this Section
6.3(d)(iii) prior to the Board of Directors of the Company making a Company
Change in Recommendation pursuant to this Section 6.3(d).

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 or this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the
CompanyÂ’s shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, it being understood that a "stop, look
and listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
shareholders of the Company) shall not be deemed to be or constitute a
Company Change in Recommendation; (ii) complying with Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act; (iii) making any disclosure to its
shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel), failure to so
disclose is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law; or (iv)
informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this
Section 6.3. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of
this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the Company that
describes the CompanyÂ’s receipt of a Company Alternative Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a
withdrawal or modification, or proposal by the Board of Directors of the
Company to withdraw or modify, the Company Recommendation, an adoption or
recommendation with respect to such Company Alternative Proposal, or a
Company Change in Recommendation.

  



  

(f) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing negotiations or discussions with any third party conducted
heretofore with respect to any Company Alternative Proposal. The Company
shall, if it has not already done so, promptly request, to the extent it has
a contractual right to do so, that each Person, if any, that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months immediately prior
to the date of this Agreement in connection with such PersonÂ’s consideration
of a Company Alterative

  



        
   

  



  

Proposal return or destroy all confidential information or data heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean
any unsolicited bona fide proposal or offer made, or any indication of
interest in making a proposal or offer, by any Person or group prior to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval (other than a proposal or offer
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) for (i) a merger or business
combination or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step
transaction or series of related transactions, with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition (by purchase, tender
offer, exchange offer or otherwise) by any Person of 20% or more of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii)
the acquisition by any Person or group of 20% or more of the issued and
outstanding Company Ordinary Shares or any other class of capital stock of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any securities convertible into
any of the foregoing); (iv) the exclusive, long term license of Trademarks of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to any third party if such license would be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (v)
any recapitalization transaction in which the shareholders of the Company
receive a payment or distribution in the form of cash, debt securities or
securities with a limited life; or (vi) any combination of the foregoing.

  



  

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Company Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a
written Company Alternative Proposal for or in respect of 50% or more of the
outstanding Company Ordinary Shares or all or substantially all of the
CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ assets that, in the good faith determination
of the Board of Directors of the Company, is reasonably capable of being
consummated, made by any Person that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s financial and
legal advisors, and considering such factors as the Board of Directors of the
Company considers to be appropriate (including the conditionality and the
timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal), is on terms that are
more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of the
Company than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, and the completion of which is not conditioned on the receipt of
financing.

  



  

Section 6.4 FILINGS, OTHER ACTIONS.

  



  

(a) COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO PROXY STATEMENT. As promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement, which shall, except to the extent provided in Section 6.3, include
the text of this Agreement, the fairness opinion referred to in Section 4.26
hereof and the Company Recommendation, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts, after consultation with Parent, to respond to any
comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement and have the
Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto.  Subject to applicable Law, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the SEC or its staff advises that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement or that the Company may commence
mailing the Proxy Statement, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the
Company.  The Company agrees that (i) none of the

  



         
 

  



  

information with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries to be included or
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and
at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein with respect to Parent
or Merger Sub to the extent based on information supplied by Parent or Merger
Sub or any Representative or Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein; and (ii) the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. The letters to
shareholders, notices of meeting, proxy statement and forms of proxies to be
distributed to shareholders in connection with the Merger and any schedules
required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith are collectively
referred to herein as the " _Proxy Statement_." Any information required
under the BC Act and the CompanyÂ’s Memorandum of Association and Articles of
Association in connection with duly calling, giving notice of, convening and
holding the Company Meeting shall be contained in the Proxy Statement, which
information shall be prepared by the Company in accordance with the BC Act
and the CompanyÂ’s Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association. If
at any time prior to the Company Meeting any event or circumstance relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly inform Parent
and shall file such amendment or supplement with the SEC and, if required by
applicable Law, the Company shall mail such amendment or supplement to the
CompanyÂ’s shareholders. Any expenses incurred in connection with the
printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including applicable SEC
filing fees) shall be paid by the Company.

  



  

(b) COVENANTS OF PARENT WITH RESPECT TO PROXY STATEMENT. Parent agrees that
none of the information with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries provided
by or on behalf of Parent to be included in the Proxy Statement will, at the
time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements
thereto, and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no covenant is made by either Parent or Merger Sub with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein to the extent
based on information supplied by the Company or any Representative or
Affiliate of the Company in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. If at any time
prior to the Company Meeting any event or circumstance relating to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, should
be discovered by Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, Parent shall promptly inform the Company (which
shall file such amendment or supplement with the SEC)

  



        
   

  



  

and, if required by applicable Law, mail such amendment or supplement to the
CompanyÂ’s shareholders.

  



  

(c) COOPERATION. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement.

  



  

(d) SHAREHOLDER MEETING.  Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement
and unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the
Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with the BC Act and its
Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders to be held as
promptly as reasonably practicable at a location in the United States of
America following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ ") and,
subject to Section 6.3 of this Agreement, shall, through its Board of
Directors, recommend to its shareholders the approval of this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Company
Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be
permitted to delay or postpone convening the Company Meeting (but not beyond
the Termination Date) if in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof (after consultation with its outside
legal advisors) such delay or postponement of the Company Meeting is
consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Subject to Section
6.3 of this Agreement and unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant
to Section 8.1, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
from its shareholders proxies to be exercised in favor of the approval of
this Agreement and the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company will take
all of the actions contemplated by this Section 6.4, regardless of whether
the Board of Directors of the Company shall have effected a Company Change in
Recommendation; _provided_ that in such event and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub make no representation
or warranty as to the validity of the Company Meeting or the Merger under the
BC Act, this Agreement or otherwise.

are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits
provided to such employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries shall have any obligation
to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of,
shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or
other rights in respect of

reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that any substitution or
replacement of existing policies shall not result in any gaps or lapses of

aggregate annual premiums, the Company may obtain such tail prepaid policy

maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of
the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 6.14.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.14 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives, and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, and shall not impair any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have under the CompanyÂ’s Memorandum of
Association and Articles of Association, or the comparable organization 

  



        
   

  



  

documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
pursuant to any indemnification agreement set forth in Section 4.17(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, under applicable Law or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.14
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner so as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnitee unless (A) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification. Parent
shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation complies with all of its

shall otherwise consent (which request for consent shall be considered in
good faith by the Company), Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (a) acquire or propose to acquire
(by merger, consolidation or acquisition of stock or assets) any corporation,
partnership or other business organization or division thereof that sells

acquisition is subject to the reporting requirements of the HSR Act and could
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, or (b) acquire or propose to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for any
and all such acquisitions not in excess of the total aggregate amount set

requested pursuant to the Support Agreements, use its reasonable best efforts
to facilitate the issuance of certificates for Company Ordinary Shares in the
name of the Lockup Shareholder as promptly as practicable after the date of

the Superior Proposal Notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ ") and
again has determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal and
financial advisors, that the proposal from the third party that was described
in the Superior Proposal Notice remains a Company Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if the third party whose proposal was
described in the Superior Proposal Notice modifies or amends such proposal to
increase the consideration to be paid for the Company Ordinary Shares or

Proposal, (C) provided a Superior Proposal Notice, (D) failed to publicly
affirm the Company Recommendation or recommend against any Company
Alternative Proposal within ten Business Days of ParentÂ’s request to do so,

Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall terminate (except for
the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of Section 8.2, Section 8.3
and Article IX), and there shall be no other liability on the part of the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, except
liability arising out of an intentional breach of this Agreement or for fraud
or as provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement, in which case, subject
to Section 9.11 hereof, the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights
and remedies available at Law or in equity.

  



  

Section 8.3 TERMINATION FEE. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary:

  



  

(a) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(g), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(h) or (iii) at any time after the date of this Agreement, (A) a Company
Alternative Proposal is publicly proposed or disclosed by the Person or group
making such Company Alternative Proposal (or, in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(f), is publicly proposed or
disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Board of Directors of the Company)
prior to and not irrevocably withdrawn at the time of the Company Meeting or
resubmitted within three months after the date of the Company Meeting, and
(B) this Agreement is terminated (x) by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(b) (but only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from
terminating this Agreement by application of the proviso of Section 8.1(b)),
(y) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d), or (z) by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(f), and (C) prior to the first anniversary of the
termination of this Agreement, any definitive agreement providing for a
Qualifying Transaction shall have been entered into (irrespective of whether
such agreement

  



        
   

  



  

was entered into with the same Person or group who made the Company
Alternative Proposal referred to in clause (A) above), then in any such event
described in Section 8.3(a)(i), Section 8.3(a)(ii) or Section 8.3(a)(iii),
the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $18,330,425 (the " _Termination Fee_
") in cash by wire transfer in immediately available funds, such payment to
be made in the case of (1) Section 8.3(a)(i) as a condition to
the termination of this Agreement, (2) Section 8.3(a)(ii) within
two Business Days following the termination of this Agreement and (3) Section
8.3(a)(iii) within two Business Days following the execution of any
definitive agreement in respect of a Qualifying Transaction and less any
amounts previously paid to Parent by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b),
if any. It is understood and agreed that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. After payment
of the Termination Fee is made, the Company shall have no further liability
to Parent or Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger ( _provided_ that nothing herein
shall release any party from liability for intentional breach of this
Agreement or for fraud or as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement).

  



  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f)
(other than for a termination in respect of the breach of a representation or
warranty occurring after (and not as of) the date of this Agreement based on
facts, events or circumstances occurring after (and not as of or prior to)
the date of this Agreement), the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal
to the sum of the Transaction Expenses actually incurred by Parent at or
prior to the termination of this Agreement for which Parent has not
theretofore been reimbursed by the Company in cash by wire transfer in
immediately available funds ( _provided_ that nothing herein shall release
any party from liability for intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud or
under the Confidentiality Agreement), such payment to be made following such
termination and within two Business Days following delivery to the Company of
notice of demand for such payment accompanied by reasonable supporting
documentation of such Transaction Expenses. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Transaction Expenses_ " means all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses, fees and costs (including all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts
and consultants and all filing fees paid to any Governmental Authority)
incurred by Parent or on its behalf in connection with or related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, including
in connection with ParentÂ’s due diligence investigation and
the authorization, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not have to pay Transaction Expenses in
excess of $2.0 million in the aggregate (the " _Transaction Expense Cap_ ")
(which Transaction Expense Cap shall be increased if Parent receives a
Request for Additional Information pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second
Request_ "), but only to the extent Parent incurs additional Transaction
Expenses from and after the date of such Second Request; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Transaction Expense Cap shall not exceed $5.0 million).

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Qualifying Transaction_ " shall mean
any (i) merger or business combination or similar transaction, including any
single or multi-step transaction or series of transactions, with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) direct or indirect acquisition (by purchase,
tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise) by any Person or group of 35% or
more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
(iii) acquisition by any Person of 35% or more of the issued and outstanding
Company Ordinary

  



        
   

  



  

Shares or any other class of capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any securities convertible into any of the foregoing), or
(iv) combination of the foregoing.

  



  

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Parent
and the Company agree that the Termination Fee does not constitute a penalty,
but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent,
in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable, for the efforts
and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the
case of liability of a party for intentional breach of this Agreement or for
fraud or under the Confidentiality Agreement, receipt of payment of the
amounts set forth in this Section 8.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, stockholders, general or limited partners,
managers, members, representatives or assignees, in each case whether former,
current or future, for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, to be
consummated.

  



  

(e) If the Company fails to pay Parent the any amount required to be paid
pursuant to this Section 8.3 when due, the Company shall pay the costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal fees and
expenses) incurred by Parent in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 8.3, and shall pay interest on any such amount
not paid when due at the rate of 5% per annum from the applicable date such
amount became due and owing through and including the date of
payment (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year).

  



  

Section 8.4 PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case
of each of Parent and Merger Sub, action by its board of directors or, to the
extent permitted by Law, the duly authorized designee of its board of
directors, and in the case of the Company, to the extent permitted by
Law, action by the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof. Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not
require the approval of the shareholders of the Company. A terminating party
shall provide written notice of termination to the other parties specifying
with reasonable particularity the basis for such termination. If more than
one provision in Section 8.1 is available to a terminating party in
connection with a termination, a terminating party may rely on any or all
available provisions in Section 8.1 for any termination.

or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York, other than Section 5-1401 of

Section 9.5 JURISDICTION; ENFORCEMENT; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

Section 9.8 SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that

final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that
the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall
have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable
as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may
be appealed.

  



  

Section 9.9 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement

thereof and except for (a) the rights of the holders of Company Ordinary
Shares to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, (b) the
right of holders of Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units to
receive the consideration provided for in Section 3.3 of this Agreement at
the Effective Time and (c) the provisions set forth in Section 6.14, this
Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

Section 9.10 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or
by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

Section 9.11 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not
have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached.  It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity (including, in the case of damages sought by the

Section 9.12 AMENDMENT; WAIVER; EXTENSION.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 2.2 of this Agreement in respect of
Section 2.2 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, this Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, no amendment to this Agreement shall be made
except as permitted by applicable Law.  Any waiver of any of the terms or
conditions of this Agreement must be in writing and must be duly executed by
or on behalf of the party to be charged with such waiver. Except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, the failure of a party to exercise any
of its rights hereunder or to insist upon strict adherence to any term or
condition hereof on any one occasion shall not be construed as a waiver or
deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement at a later date.  Further, no
waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed
to or shall constitute a waiver of any other term or condition hereof
(whether or not similar).

  



  

(b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company, on the one hand,
and Parent (on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub), on the other hand, may (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein by the other party or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by the other party, or (iii)
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance by the other
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

  



  

Section 9.13 NO LIMITATION. It is the intention of the parties that, to the
extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot
be given to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties,
covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement shall be construed to be
cumulative and that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing
condition in this Agreement shall be given full, separate and independent
effect and nothing set forth in any provision herein shall in any way be
deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision
hereof.

"delivered by the Company," "delivered to Parent," "provided to Parent,"
"made available to Parent" or similar expressions shall mean that the Company
