therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, he shall be indemnified
against all expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or
on his behalf in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit
or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without
prejudice), without (i)&nbsp;the disposition being adverse to the Indemnitee, (ii)&nbsp;an
adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii)&nbsp;a plea of guilty or

did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and (v)&nbsp;with respect to any criminal proceeding, an
adjudication that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful,
the Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful
with respect thereto.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <U>Notification and Defense of Claim.</U> As a condition precedent to his right to
be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable
of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or
could be sought. With respect to any action suit, proceeding or investigation of which the
Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its
own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the
Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to
the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with such claim, other than as provided below in this Section&nbsp;4. The Indemnitee
shall have the right to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of
the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i)&nbsp;the employment of
counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii)&nbsp;counsel to the
Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or
position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct
of the defense of such action or (iii)&nbsp;the Corporation shall not in fact have employed
counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses
of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as
otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall not be entitled,
without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in
the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably
made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii)&nbsp;above.

event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 of this Article
of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice
under this Article, any expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in
defending a civil or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal
therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
matter; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the payment of such expenses incurred by an

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced
in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to
be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such undertaking shall be
accepted without reference to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to make such
repayment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <U>Procedure for Indemnification.</U> In order to obtain indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to Sections&nbsp;1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the Indemnitee
shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such request such
documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably
necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of
expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60&nbsp;days after receipt by the
Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under
Sections&nbsp;1, 2 or 5 the Corporation determines within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee
did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections&nbsp;1 or 2, as the case
may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance by (a)&nbsp;a majority vote of the
directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the
action, suit or proceeding in question (&#147;disinterested directors&#148;), whether or not a quorum,
(b)&nbsp;a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled
to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders
who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, (c)
independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel
to the Corporation), or (d)&nbsp;a court of competent jurisdiction.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <U>Remedies.</U> The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this
Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the
Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made
within the 60-day period referred to above in Section&nbsp;6. Unless otherwise required by law,
the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement
of expenses under this Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct, nor an actual determination of the Corporation pursuant to Section&nbsp;6
that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to
the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct. The Indemnitee&#146;s expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred in connection
with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any
such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

or of the relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable laws shall affect or
diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the

this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee
seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or
statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to any action in his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while
holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to
be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and
administrators of the Indemnitee. In addition to, and not in limitation of, any other
provision set forth in this Article, the Corporation is authorized, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to)
agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to which the DGCL permits the Corporation
to provide indemnification) through bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other
persons, by vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the
indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by Section&nbsp;145 of the DGCL, subject only
to limits created by the DGCL and applicable decisional law, with respect to actions for
breach of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders, and others.

of this Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses
(including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding
or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof,
the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses
(including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the
Indemnitee is entitled.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <U>Insurance</U>. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation
or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any
employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such
capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have
the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <U>Merger or Consolidation</U>. If the Corporation is merged into or consolidated
with another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the surviving
corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this Article with respect
to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions,
transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation.

on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit,

by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any application
