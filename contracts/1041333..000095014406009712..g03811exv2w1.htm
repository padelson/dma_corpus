 _Preamble_  

   

 The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have each approved the transactions described herein subject to the conditions set forth herein in accordance with the DGCL. This Agreement provides for the business combination between Parent and the Company pursuant to the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity.

The separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger, shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware and shall succeed to and assume all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall be consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, which has been approved and adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent and by Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub. 

   ##### 

  

  

1.2 Time and Place of Closing.

The Closing shall be held at such location as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. 

  

1.3 Effective Time. 

   

 On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") reflecting the Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the time the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware shall be the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

ARTICLE 2 TERMS OF MERGER 

   

2.1 Certificate of Incorporation. 

   

 The certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended or repealed thereafter.

 The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended or repealed thereafter. 

  

2.3 Directors and Officers.

ARTICLE 3 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF PARENT, THE COMPANY AND
MERGER SUB 

   

3.1 Conversion of Shares. 

   

 Subject to the provisions of this Article 3, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the stockholders of any of the foregoing, the shares of the constituent corporations shall be converted as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Each share of capital stock of Parent issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock (excluding shares held by any Company Entity or any Parent Entity which shall be treated in accordance with Section 3.2 and excluding shares held by stockholders who perfect their statutory appraisal rights, if applicable, as provided in Section 3.3) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive a cash payment in the amount of $3.85 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding of Taxes, upon the surrender of the certificate formerly representing such share (or the documents required by Section 4.1 for a lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed certificate), in each case, in the manner provided in Article 4. 

  

3.2 Shares Held by the Company or Parent. 

   

 Each share of Company Common Stock held by any Company Entity or by any Parent Entity shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor. 

  

3.3 Dissenting Stockholders. 

   

 (a) Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who perfects such holders appraisal rights, if applicable and available, in accordance with and as contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation the value of such shares in cash as determined pursuant to such provision of Law; provided, that no such payment shall be made to any such Dissenting Stockholder unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder has complied with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and surrendered to the Company the certificate or certificates representing the shares for which payment is being made. In the event that after the Effective Time a Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses, such holders right to appraisal of and payment for such holders shares of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting Common Shares_ "), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall issue and deliver the consideration to which such Dissenting Stockholder is entitled under this Article 3 (without interest) upon surrender by such holder of the certificate or certificates representing the Dissenting Common Shares held by such holder. 

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served on or otherwise received by the Company pursuant to the DGCL relating thereto, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

   ##### 

  

  

3.4 Stock Options. 

   

 (a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action to provide that each option, stock appreciation right, or other Equity Right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (" _Company Options_ ") granted by the Company under the Company Stock Plans and outstanding at the Effective Time, shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. Holders of the Company Options shall be given the opportunity to exercise their Company Options, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, and thereby receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such exercised Company Option pursuant to Section 3.1. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option which is not exercised in accordance with Section 3.4(a) shall be canceled in exchange for a cash payment by the Surviving Corporation for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (" _Option Settlement Payment_ ") equal to the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option. At the Effective Time, each such Company Option shall no longer represent the right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, but in lieu thereof shall represent only the nontransferable right to receive the Option Settlement Payment referred to above. Option Settlement Payments will be made by the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) business days after the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as may be necessary in respect of the foregoing to satisfy the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act. 

  

3.5 Stock Purchase Plan. 

   

 Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action with respect to the Companys 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") to provide that (a) the Purchase Date for the Offering Period (as such terms are defined in the ESPP) that is in effect as of the date of the Effective Time shall occur on or before the last trading day prior to the Effective Time, (b) all Company Options issued and outstanding under the ESPP on such Purchase Date will be automatically exercised on such Purchase Date, and (c) the shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of such Company Options shall be treated in the manner described in Section 3.1. 

  

ARTICLE 4 PAYMENT FOR SHARES 

   

4.1 Procedures. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to make the payments of the funds to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled pursuant to Section 3.1 and Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent to provide for the foregoing on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company. At the Closing, prior to the Effective Time, but after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 (or the waiver of such 

   ##### 

  

    

conditions by Parent pursuant to Section 11.5(a)), Parent shall deposit by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, in trust with the Paying Agent
in an account specified by the Paying Agent (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, cash in an aggregate amount
equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (the " _Aggregate Merger
Consideration_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates which represented shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Certificates_ ")
whose shares were converted pursuant to Article 3 to the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, appropriate transmittal materials and instructions
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to such Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates to the Paying Agent). The Certificate or Certificates of Company
Common Stock so delivered shall be duly endorsed as the Paying Agent may
require. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by Certificates that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration related thereto may be
issued to a transferee if the Certificates representing such shares are
delivered to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt of (i) an
affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such Certificate to be lost,
mislaid, stolen or destroyed, (ii) such bond, security or indemnity as Parent
and the Paying Agent may reasonably require and (iii) any other
documents necessary to evidence and effect the bona fide exchange thereof,
the Paying Agent shall issue to such holder the consideration into which the
shares represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate
shall have been converted. The Paying Agent may establish such
other reasonable and customary rules and procedures in connection with its
duties as it may deem appropriate. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with
the distribution of the consideration provided in Article 3. 

  

 (b) After the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.2 or as to which statutory dissenters rights have been perfected as provided in Section 3.3) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares to the Paying Agent and shall promptly upon surrender thereof receive in exchange therefor an amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates (less any amounts deducted pursuant to Section 4.1(c)). The Paying Agent shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration to which any former holder of Company Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders such holders Certificate or Certificates (or the documents required by Section 4.1(a) for a lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate) for exchange as provided in this Section 4.1. 

  

 (c) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or holders of Company Options such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that 

   ##### 

  

    

any amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock or holders of Company Options in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 (d) At any time following 270 days after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to the Surviving Corporation any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund which has not been disbursed to holders of Certificates as of such time, and thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any applicable Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon; provided that such holders shall have no greater rights against the Surviving Corporation than may be accorded to general creditors of the Surviving Corporation under applicable laws.

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, including the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action in respect thereof on the part of Parent and Merger Sub. This Agreement represents a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceedings may be brought). 

  

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub, nor the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by each of Parent and Merger Sub with any of the provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of Parents certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (ii) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of any Parent Subsidiary (including Merger Sub), or (iii) constitute or result in a Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to, or result in the creation of any Lien on any Asset of any Parent Entity under, any Contract or Permit of any Parent Entity, where such Default or Lien, or any failure to obtain

such Consent, is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) subject to receipt of the requisite
Consents referred to in Section 9.1(b), constitute or result in a
Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to, any Law or Order
applicable to any Parent Entity or any of their respective material Assets. 

  

 (c) Other than in connection or compliance with the provisions of the Securities Laws, applicable state corporate and securities Laws, and other than Consents required under the HSR Act, or any foreign competition, antitrust, investment or similar Laws, no material notice to, filing with, or Consent of, any public body or authority is necessary for the consummation by Parent of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

Parent has also entered into an equity commitment letter with Vista Equity Fund II, LP (" _Holdings_ ") (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which Holdings has committed to provide funds to Parent that, together with the financing described in the Debt Commitment Letter, shall be sufficient to permit Parent and Merger Sub to pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration and aggregate Option Settlement Payments and pay all related fees and expenses. Parent has delivered true, correct and complete copies of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter, dated as of the date hereof (collectively, the " _Commitment Letters_ ") to the Company. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to obtaining the debt and equity financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters other than as expressly set forth therein. Each of the Commitment Letters, in the forms so delivered, is in full force and effect and has not been amended or terminated in any manner. Parent has taken all other actions required to cause the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter to be effective, and each of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter is a valid and binding commitment of Parent and the financing sources party thereto. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a Default or breach on the part of Parent under any term or condition of the Commitment Letters. Parent is not aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions, statements, representations or warranties therein inaccurate in any material respect or that would reasonably be expected to cause the commitment provided in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter to be terminated or ineffective or any of the conditions contained therein not to be met. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Commitment Letters.

 (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.5(a), each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other Order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking material damages; provided, however, that no Party hereto shall be obligated to agree to proffer to, divest or hold separate, or enter into any license or similar agreement with respect to any of its material Assets or its business. 

  

 (c) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.5(a), the Company shall and shall cause each of the Company Entities and each of their Representatives to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including using their respective reasonable best efforts to cause appropriate officers and employees to be available on a customary basis to meet with prospective lenders and investors in presentations, meetings and due diligence sessions, to assist with the preparation of disclosure documents in connection therewith, to execute and deliver any pledge and security documents or other definitive financing documents and to assist in obtaining other customary items required to satisfy any closing conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter and related definitive documentation; provided that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense that is not simultaneously reimbursed by Parent in connection with the debt financing prior to the Effective Time.

In the event that all conditions to the Commitment Letters (other than the availability or funding contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter) have been satisfied in Parents good faith judgment, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such financing under the Commitment Letters to fund such financing required to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date (including by taking enforcement action to cause such lenders and other Persons providing such financing to fund such financing). In the event any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms substantially similar to those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (the commitment letter evidencing such debt commitments shall also be referred to herein as a " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall deliver a copy of any proposed amendment to a Commitment Letter to the Company not less than two (2) business days prior to the proposed execution of same. Parent shall not enter into any amendment, modification or supplement to a Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company to the extent that such amendment, modification, or supplement imposes additional conditions precedent to the funding obligations thereunder or reduces the amount of the financing committed thereunder. Parent shall keep upon request the Company reasonably apprised of material developments relating to the equity and debt financings and Commitment Letters.

 (b) In addition to the Parties respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which is hereby reaffirmed and adopted, and incorporated by reference herein, each Party shall, and shall cause its advisers and agents to, maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries businesses, operations and financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

certify the destruction of all documents and copies thereof, and all work
papers containing confidential information received from the other Party. 

   

 (c) From the date hereof until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to, afford to the Representatives of Parent, during normal business hours in a manner so as not to have interfered with the normal business operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, reasonable access to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives.

8.9 Charter Provisions. 

   

 Each Company Entity shall take all necessary action to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any Person under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other governing instruments of any Company Entity or restrict or impair the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to, shares of any Company Entity that may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by them.

For a period of 12 months after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide generally to officers and employees of the Company Entities severance benefits in accordance with the policies and practices of the Company as disclosed in Section 8.11 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms all employment, severance, consulting and other compensation Contracts between any Company Entity and any current or former director, officer, or employee thereof, and all provisions for vested benefits or other vested amounts earned or accrued through the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans.

   ##### 

  

 

Surviving Corporations outside counsel, such determination to be made in good
faith and to not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its reasonable efforts (and the Company shall cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy (provided that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous or (ii) with the consent of the Company given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective Time and covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance; provided, that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such liability insurance in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (which premium the Company represents and warrants to be $500,200 for the 12 month period ended June 24, 2007) and if the annual premium exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall provide the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for such amount.

In the event of any such Litigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, that (x) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction; (y) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Litigation; and (z) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and provided, further, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law or the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws. 

  

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its Assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.12.

   ##### 

  

    

other provision of this Agreement. No waiver of any condition or of the breach
of any term contained in this Agreement in one or more instances shall be

term of this Agreement.
