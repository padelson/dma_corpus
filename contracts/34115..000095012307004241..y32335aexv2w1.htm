 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined that it is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the shareholders of the Company, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act of the State of Florida (the " _FBCA_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii) adopted this Agreement in accordance with the FBCA, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and (iii) resolved to recommend the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company;

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company are entering into a shareholders agreement with Parent (the " _Shareholders Agreement_ ") pursuant to which such shareholders have irrevocably agreed, among other things, to vote or cause to be voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement all Shares (as defined below) beneficially owned by such shareholders in accordance with and subject to the terms set forth in the Shareholders Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

 SECTION 1.4 _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the articles of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in the Merger so as to read in its entirety as is set forth on _Exhibit A_ annexed hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by law. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended in the Merger so as to read in their entirety in the form as is set forth in _Exhibit B_ annexed hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by law. 

  

 SECTION 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall submit their resignations to be effective as of the Effective Time.

 (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and

 SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Shares, Stock Units, and Deferred Compensation Plans_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall take all action necessary such that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares (an " _Option_ "), other than any Rollover Securities, granted under any Company Plan that, in each case, is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be canceled, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation on the 15th business day following the Effective Time, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares previously subject to such Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Option, less

In the case of any Stock Units with respect to which the amount of the award is contingent upon performance level achievement for periods continuing after the Effective Time, the number of Shares subject to such Stock Units shall be determined on the basis of deemed "plan" level performance achievement (as defined in the relevant Company Stock Plan or award agreement) for such periods.

 SECTION 2.3 _Surrender of Shares_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a). At the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.3(b). Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (a) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock and following any losses Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly provide (or cause to be provided) additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the shareholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (b) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or the Class A Dissenting Shares), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Shares for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (less any required withholding taxes) and such Certificate or book-entry shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such 

   ##### 

  

   

payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by, and in accordance
with, this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share (other
than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or the Class A Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this Article II. 

  

 (c) At any time following the date that is twelve months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable (without interest) upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares represented thereby. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article II. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Shares pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax (as defined below) laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and are paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 (f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as 

   ##### 

  

   

indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article
II. 

  

 SECTION 2.4 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares) shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, merger or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such change. 

  

 SECTION 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and unless otherwise provided by applicable law, each share of Class A Common Stock which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which is owned by a shareholder who, pursuant to Section 607.1301, et seq., of the FBCA duly, timely and validly exercises and perfects his, her or its appraisal rights with respect to his, her or its shares of Class A Common Stock (the " _Class A Dissenting Shares_") shall not be converted into the right to receive, or be exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration, but, instead, the holder thereof shall be entitled to payment in cash from the Surviving Corporation of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 607.1301, et seq., of the FBCA. If any such holder shall have failed to duly, timely and validly exercise or perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights, each share of Class A Common Stock of such holder shall cease to be deemed a Class A Dissenting Share and each such share shall automatically be converted into and shall thereafter be exchangeable only for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (without interest) as provided in this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent (i) reasonable notice of any notice received by the Company of an intent to demand the fair value or a demand for the fair value of any shares of Class A Common Stock, withdrawals and attempted withdrawals of such notices and any other notices or instruments delivered pursuant to Section 607.1301, et. seq., of the FBCA and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of such appraisal rights (or offers or attempts to settle same). The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent or as otherwise required by Law, make any payment with respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

 (b) Except as set forth in Section 2.5(a) with respect to Class A Shares, no holder of shares of Common Stock nor any other person will have any appraisal or dissenters rights with respect to any shares of Common Stock, pursuant to the FBCA or any other provision of Law, in connection with the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

   ##### 

  

   

not otherwise excluded from the definition of a "Material Adverse Effect" may
be taken into account in determining whether there has been a Material
Adverse Effect); provided that, in the case of the immediately preceding

contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any
legally required disclosure to shareholders with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal (provided that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors may
make any Change of Recommendation unless permitted by Section 6.1 or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal unless permitted by Section 6.5(b)); (ii) prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, providing access to its properties,
books and records and providing information or data in response to a request
therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors receives from the
person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement
on terms no more favorable to such person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary
in order for the Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement and it being understood that the Company may enter into a
confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision or with a standstill
provision less favorable to the Company if it waives or similarly modifies
the standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement); (iii) prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, contacting and engaging in discussions
with any person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and
any material terms thereof and the conditions to consummation so as

Proposal could lead to a Superior Proposal; and (iv) prior to obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote, contacting and engaging in any negotiations or
discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal (which negotiations or discussions are not
solely for clarification purposes), if and only to the extent that in
connection with the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iv), (1) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that,
(x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
constitute or result in, a Superior Proposal, and (y) that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law and (2) prior to taking such action, the Company shall provide
written notice to Parent of such matter. 

  

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Proposal Documentation (as defined below) or (ii) execute (or allow the Company or any of its subsidiaries to execute) any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 

   ##### 

  

   

6.5(a)) (any such documentation, " _Acquisition Proposal Documentation_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Section 6.5 to
the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote
(but after the expiration of the Notice Period (as defined below)), the
Companys Board of Directors determines, in response to an Acquisition
Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a
material breach of Section 6.5(a), that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, (A) the Company may terminate this Agreement, (B) its Board
of Directors may approve or recommend such Superior Proposal to its
shareholders and/or (C) immediately prior to or concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement, the Company may enter into or execute
any Acquisition Proposal Documentation with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) and its Board of Directors may not
approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal and the Company may not enter
into or execute any Acquisition Proposal Documentation, and any such action
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company prior to or
concurrently with taking such action pays to Parent the fee payable pursuant
to Section 8.2(b); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) and its Board of
Directors may not approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal and the
Company may not enter into or execute any Acquisition Proposal Documentation
unless (x) the Company has provided a written notice to Parent (a " _Notice
of Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company has received a
Superior Proposal and specifying the identity of the person making such
Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof, together with copies of any
written offer or proposal in respect of such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that neither the delivery of a Notice of Superior Proposal nor
any subsequent public announcement thereof, in each case in and of itself,
shall entitle Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)),
and (y) Parent does not, within three business days following its receipt of
the Notice of Superior Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), make an offer
that, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, results in the
applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal (
_provided_ that, during the Notice Period, the Company shall, if so requested
by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to any revised
proposal from Parent in respect of the terms of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement), it being further understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new Notice Period. 

  

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any Acquisition Proposal for more than 50% of the outstanding equity interests in the Company or more than 50% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, and considering such factors as the Board of Directors of the Company considers to be appropriate (including the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to the Company and its shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is reasonably capable of being consummated. 

  

 (d) Without limiting any other rights of Parent under this Agreement, neither any Change of Recommendation nor any termination of this Agreement shall have any effect on any of the approvals or other actions referred to herein for the purpose of causing the Anti- 

   ##### 

  

   

Takeover Statutes to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

  

 SECTION 6.6 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_. 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the second anniversary thereof, to maintain the severance-related provisions of existing Company Plans set forth on Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and to provide the severance payments and benefits required thereunder to be provided any Company Employee terminated during that twenty-four month period.

 (c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans, to the extent this credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service), under any employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company Employees service with the Company, its subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent or its subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 (f) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this agreement and nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.6, expressed or implied, shall be construed to prevent Parent or any of its affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any benefit plan that the Parent or any of its affiliates may establish or maintain. 

  

 SECTION 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under any employment agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director or employee of the Company and its subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Parent or the Surviving Corporation within ten business days of receipt by Parent from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by FBCA or the Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is 

   ##### 

  

   

not entitled to indemnification, (y) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (z) the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter. 

  

 (b) The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals. 

  

 (c) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time for the persons who, as of the date of this Agreement, are covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policies, directors and officers liability insurance policies that provide coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that are no less favorable in both amount and terms and conditions of coverage than the existing policies of the Company (true and complete copies of which have previously been made available to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage, in either case from insurance carriers with financial strength ratings equal to or greater than the financial strength ratings of the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance carriers; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in lieu of the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation may purchase a six-year "tail" coverage that is no less favorable in both amount and terms and conditions of coverage than the existing policies of the Company from insurance carriers with financial strength ratings equal to or greater than the financial strength ratings of the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance carriers;  _provided_ _further_ that in no event shall Parent or Surviving Corporation be required to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section 6.7(c) in excess of 300% of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company in respect of such coverage for its most recently completed fiscal year; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Parent agrees to honor and perform under, and to cause the Surviving Corporations to honor and perform under, all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

 (e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The 

   ##### 

  

   

indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to
law, contract or otherwise. 

  

 (f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in Section 6.6 and this Section 6.7. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.7.

 (i) if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date; _provided_ that the Company shall have given Parent at least 30 days written notice prior to such termination stating the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i); and _provided_ further that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i) if the Company is then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

 (i) if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date; _provided_ that Parent shall have given the Company at least 30 days written notice prior to such termination stating Parents intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.3(e)(i);  _provided_ further that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)(i) if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii), then the Company shall pay $90,000,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two business days following such termination), by wire transfer of same day funds; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(f) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i) and (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)), or prior to the breach giving rise to Parents right to terminate under Section 8.1(e)(i) (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i)) or prior to the taking of a vote to approve this Agreement at the Shareholders Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(f)) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made or communicated to the senior management or the Board of Directors of the Company or shall have been publicly announced or publicly made known to the shareholders of the Company, and not withdrawn prior to such termination, such breach or such taking of a vote to approve this Agreement, as applicable, and (B) within twelve months after such termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to, or shall have consummated, any Acquisition Proposal, then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee, such payment to be made upon the earlier of the Company entering into an agreement providing for, or consummating, such Acquisition Proposal, by wire transfer of same day funds. For the purpose of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the term Acquisition Proposal to "20% or more" will be deemed to be references to "more than 50%".

In the event that the Company elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) and provides written notice of its election to receive the Parent Termination Fee, its receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its affiliates against Parent, Merger Sub and any of their respective current, former or future directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members, affiliates, stockholders, assignees, representatives or affiliates for any loss or damage suffered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall also be obligated with respect to Section 6.4(b), Section 6.9, the penultimate sentence of Section 6.10(b) and Section 8.3, unless such obligation arises out of the same set of facts that provided the basis for the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to enforce all of its rights under this Agreement and the Equity Financing Commitment in the event that the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) and does not elect to receive the Parent Termination Fee.
