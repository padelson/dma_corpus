(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall repay, or cause to be repaid, all Estimated

in each case together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. The
Estimated Closing Calculations shall be determined on a consolidated basis in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the methodologies,
practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and principles used in the
preparation of the Audited Financial Statements and the Sample Working
Capital, as applicable. At the request of Buyer, the Sellers shall cause the
Target Companies to perform, jointly with Buyer or its Representatives, a
physical count of the inventory of the Target Companies as of a date prior to
the Closing mutually agreeable to Buyer and the Sellers Representative.

Section 2.05 _Post Closing Adjustment_.

(a) Promptly, but in any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative a consolidated
balance sheet of the Target Companies (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), which
shall reflect Buyers determination of (i) each Estimated Closing Calculation,
in each case determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the methodologies, practices, estimation
techniques, assumptions and principles used in the preparation of the Audited
Financial Statements and the Sample Working Capital, as applicable, and (ii)
the Proposed Adjustment Amount, in each case of clause (i) and (ii), together
with such detail and supporting documentation as shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Sellers Representative. The " _Proposed Adjustment Amount_
" shall be equal to (which may be a positive or negative number) Buyers
determination of Closing Consideration as set forth on the Closing Balance
Sheet delivered pursuant to this  _Section 2.05(a)_ _minus_ the Sellers
Representatives determination of Closing Consideration as set forth in the
Closing Certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 2.04_ (Closing
Certificate).

 

(b) If the Sellers Representative disagrees with Buyers determination of any
Estimated Closing Calculation or the Proposed Adjustment Amount, in each case
as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet, the Sellers Representative may,
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, deliver a
written notice (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer setting forth the Sellers
Representatives calculation of each disputed amount (each an " _Item of
Dispute_ "). In preparing such Dispute Notice, the Sellers Representative
shall have access to all

 



14  items reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative related to the
Closing Balance Sheet. If Buyer does not receive a Dispute Notice within
thirty (30) days after receipt by the Sellers Representative of the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Balance Sheet shall be conclusive and binding upon
each of the Parties. If Buyer receives a Dispute Notice from the Sellers
Representative within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Sellers
Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve each Item
of Dispute, and, if any Item of Dispute is so resolved, the Closing Balance
Sheet shall be modified to the extent necessary to reflect such resolution. If
any Item of Dispute remains unresolved as of the 20th day after delivery by
the Sellers Representative of the Dispute Notice, Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall jointly retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or an
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing (the " _Accounting
Firm_ ") to resolve such remaining disagreement. If Buyer and the Sellers
Representative are unable to agree on the choice of the Accounting Firm, then
the Accounting Firm shall be a nationally recognized valuation firm selected
by lot (after each of Buyer and the Sellers Representative has submitted two
proposed firms and then excluded one firm designated by the other party).
Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall request that the Accounting Firm
render a determination as to each unresolved Item of Dispute within thirty
(30) days after its retention, and Buyer, the Target Companies and their
respective Representatives shall cooperate fully with the Accounting Firm so
as to enable it to make such determination as quickly and accurately as
practicable, including the provision by Buyer and the Target Companies of all
books and records and work papers (including those of accountants) relating to
the Closing Balance Sheet and all other items reasonably requested by the
Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts that were set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Dispute
Notice and that remain unresolved by Buyer and the Sellers Representative. In
resolving any Item of Dispute, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to
any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either
Person or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Person.
The Accounting Firms determination(s) shall be based upon the definitions of
each Estimated Closing Calculation (as applicable) included in this
Agreement. The Accounting Firms determination of each Item of Dispute
submitted to it shall be in writing, shall conform with this _Section 2.05_
and shall be conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties, and the Closing
Balance Sheet shall be modified to the extent necessary to reflect such
determination(s). The Accounting Firm shall provide a determination of the
"Final Adjustment Amount" which shall be equal to (which may be a positive or
negative number) the Accounting Firms determination of Closing Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.05_ _minus_ the Sellers Representatives
determination of Closing Consideration set forth in the Closing Certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.04_ (Closing Certificate). The Accounting
Firm shall allocate its fees, costs and expenses between Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the
other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each such Party bears to the amount actually contested
by such Party. Cash, Indebtedness and Working Capital, in each case as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.05_, are referred to herein as
" _Final Cash_ ," " _Final Indebtedness_ " and " _Final Working Capital_ ,"
respectively. 

(c) The " _Final Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be a positive or negative
number, shall be equal to (i) the amount agreed to as the Final Adjustment
Amount at any time in writing by Buyer and the Sellers Representative; (ii)
if a Closing Balance Sheet is not delivered by Buyer within the time period
required by  _Section 2.05(a)_, $0; (iii) if a Dispute Notice is not

 



15  delivered by the Sellers Representative to Buyer within the time period
required by _Section 2.05(b)_, the Proposed Adjustment Amount set forth in
the Closing Balance Sheet; or (iv) the Final Adjustment Amount as set forth
in the written determination of the Accounting Firm made in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 2.05_.

 

(d) _Payments_. Within five (5) days after the determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount, (i) if the Final Adjustment Amount is a positive number,
Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the account(s) designated in writing
by the Sellers Representative an amount in cash equal to the Final Adjustment
Amount; (ii) if the Final Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the
Sellers Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay to the account
designated in writing by Buyer (x) an amount in cash from the Working Capital
Escrow Funds equal to the lesser of the Final Adjustment Amount and the
Working Capital Escrow Funds, and (y) an amount in cash from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds equal to the amount by which the Final Adjustment
Amount exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Funds, if any. Any payments made
pursuant to this  _Section 2.05(d)_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Closing Consideration by the Parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

(e) _Updating Percentage Allocations; Allocation of the Closing
Consideration_. In the event any payments are required to be made by Buyer or
by or on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to this  _Section 2.05_ or _ARTICLE
X_ (Indemnification), the Sellers Representative shall promptly deliver an
updated _Schedule 1.1(c)_ to Buyer and each Seller, reflecting a revised
Percentage Allocation for each Seller (including, after giving effect to the
manner in which Final Cash, Final Indebtedness, Final Working Capital and the
Final Adjustment Amount are calculated and the allocation of the Closing
Consideration to each Seller in accordance with the Target Companies Charter
Documents). The Parties agree to allocate the Closing Consideration (and all
other capitalizable costs) to each Seller according to such Sellers
Percentage Allocation, in each case, as adjusted pursuant to this  _Section
2.05(e)_.

Section 2.06 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Sellers Representative, Buyer
and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment to any Party under this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement or the Working Capital Escrow Agreement such Taxes as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment or any
other Tax withholding obligation with respect to the sale of the Shares. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted by the Sellers
Representative, Buyer or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Sellers Representative, Buyer or the Escrow Agent, as the case
may be. The Sellers Representative, Buyer or the Escrow Agent, as the case
may be, shall pay over to the appropriate Governmental Authority amounts
withheld under this _Section 2.06_.

this Agreement or with the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, none of the Target
Companies shall take any action of the type that, if taken after the Reference
Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date hereof, would have been required to
be disclosed on _Schedule 3.08_.

 

Section 6.02 _Notices and Consents_

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall
cooperate fully with the other Parties and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner possible, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including by (i) obtaining (and cooperating with
the other Parties in obtaining) any clearance, consent, authorization, order
or approval of, or exemption by, any Governmental Authority required to be
obtained or made by Buyer or the Target Companies in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and making any and all registrations and
filings that may be necessary or advisable to obtain the approval or waiver
from, or to avoid any Action by, any Governmental Authority; (ii) defending
any Action, whether brought by a Governmental Authority or other third party,
seeking to challenge this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including by seeking to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining
order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) executing any
certificates, instruments or other documents that are necessary to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry
out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

 



37 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties
shall file any Notification and Report Forms and related material that it may
be required to file with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act within
three (3) Business Days following the date of this Agreement (collectively,
the " _HSR Filing Package_ "), and will promptly make any further filings
pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable in connection
therewith. Each of the Parties will request early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act. The Parties will cooperate with each other in
connection with (i) the making of all such filings or responses, including
providing copies of all such documents (including redacted versions to the
extent reasonably necessary to protect confidential or proprietary
information) to the non-filing or non-responding Party and its advisors prior
to filing or responding to allow such other Party reasonable time to review
and comment on such filings or responses, and (ii) the antitrust defense of
the transactions contemplated hereby in any investigation or litigation by, or
negotiations with, any Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including keeping each other apprised of
the status of such matters.

(c) "Commercially reasonable efforts" as used in this _Section 6.02_ shall
not include any requirement to pay any consideration, to agree to any
undertaking or modification to any contract or agreement or to offer to grant
any financial accommodation not required by the terms of such contract or
agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, none of the Buyer, the Target Companies, any of the Target
Companies Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
required (i) to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any
of their respective businesses or assets, (ii) to agree to any limitation on
the operation or conduct of their respective businesses or (iii) to waive any
of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VIII_ of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Buyer, the
Target Companies or any of their Subsidiaries shall have any liability for a
failure to obtain any consent from a Governmental Authority that satisfies
the foregoing requirements as long as such Person, as the case may be,
complies with its obligations set forth in this _Section 6.02(c)_.

 

Section 6.03 _Access_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing
Date or the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
9.01_ (Termination), the Sellers Representative shall permit Representatives
of Buyer (including financial and legal representatives) and the Financing
Sources to have reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the
normal business operations of the Target Companies, to all premises,
properties, executive officers, books, records, policies, contracts and
documents of the Target Companies; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not apply with respect to any information the disclosure of which would,
in the Target Companies or the Sellers Representatives sole discretion,
waive any privilege.

Section 6.04 _Supplemental Schedules_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, the Target Companies, the Sellers
Representative and Buyer, as the case may be (the " _Updating Party_ "), shall
promptly update, amend or modify the Schedules relating to the representations
and warranties in _ARTICLE III_  (Representations and Warranties of the
Target

 



38  Companies), _ARTICLE IV_ (Representations and Warranties of the Sellers) and
_ARTICLE V_ (Representations and Warranties of Buyer), respectively, to
reflect any facts, circumstances or events (including the occurrence or non-
occurrence thereof) which would reasonably be expected to cause any such
representation or warranty made by a Party to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, by providing Buyer (in the case of an update, amendment or
modification by the Target Companies or the Sellers Representative) or the
Sellers Representative (in the case of an update, amendment or modification
by Buyer), as applicable, with written notice setting forth the update,
amendment or modification and specifying the Schedule or Schedules affected
thereby. If any such update, amendment or modification discloses any material
development that would cause an inability of the Updating Party to deliver
the officers certificate to be delivered hereunder at Closing by it as
contemplated by _Section 8.02_ (Conditions to Obligations of Buyer) or
_Section 8.03_ (Conditions to Obligations of the Target Companies and the
Sellers) without giving effect to this _Section 6.04_, as the case may be (a
" _Material Update_ "), the Updating Party must promptly provide to Buyer (in
the case of Material Update by the Target Companies or the
Sellers Representative) or the Sellers Representative (in the case of a
Material Update by Buyer), as applicable, any information or documentation
reasonably requested by Buyer or the Sellers Representative, as applicable,
in order for such Person to evaluate the Material Update, and, if the
Material Update is provided less than five (5) days before the Sellers
Representative Outside Date (in the case of Material Update by the Target
Companies or the Sellers Representative) or the Buyer Outside Date (in the
case of a Material Update by Buyer), as applicable, the Sellers
Representative Outside Date or the Buyer Outside Date, as applicable, will be
extended until five (5) days after the Material Update to afford the other
Parties an opportunity to review such information. After receiving the
Material Update and the related information and documentation reasonably
requested by it, Buyer (in the case of Material Update by the
Target Companies or the Sellers Representative) or the Sellers
Representative (in the case of a Material Update by Buyer), as applicable,
will have five (5) days to terminate this Agreement by providing written
notice to the Updating Party, with such termination being the sole remedy
relating to matters set forth in the Material Update, and if such Person does
not terminate this Agreement within such period, the Material Update will
amend the applicable Schedule, qualify the specific representations and
warranties referenced in the Material Update, and cure the specific
misrepresentation or breach of representations and warranties that would have
existed hereunder had the Material Update not been provided.

 

Section 6.05 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. From the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, Buyer and Buyers Representatives shall not
contact or communicate with the customers and suppliers of the Target
Companies in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or about the
Target Companies in any way without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative.

Section 6.06 _Financial Information Cooperation_. The Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the Buyer (at Buyers sole cost
and expense) as promptly as reasonably practicable the financial and other
information regarding the Target Companies as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer to satisfy any disclosure requirements applicable to Buyer or its
Affiliates under Regulations S-X or S-K of the Securities Act, and other
applicable securities Laws, including the execution and delivery of customary
representation letters to McGladrey LLP and audit reports thereon by such
accounting firm, together with any consents required for Buyer to use or
disclose such reports. The obligations of Sellers in this _Section 6.06 _

 



39  shall survive until the operating results of the Target Companies have been
reflected in the audited consolidated financial statements of Parent, as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for a complete fiscal year.

Section 6.07 _Restructuring_. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers and
the Target Companies will consummate, and will cause certain of their
Affiliates to consummate, an internal restructuring consisting of the
following steps, which steps will take place in the order in which they are
listed, and which restructuring will be duly authorized by all requisite
partnership, limited liability company or corporate actions, as applicable, on
the part of the entities involved:

(a) In accordance with the organizational documents of SF Opco, PV IPco and SF
Holdco, SF Holdco shall distribute to VMG Holdco a portion of the equity
interests it holds in each of SF Opco and PV IPco (collectively, the "
_Equity Interests_ ").

(b) In accordance with the organizational documents of SF Opco, PV IPco and
VMG Holdco, VMG Holdco shall transfer to Splitter LP the Equity Interests in
redemption of Splitter LPs equity interest in VMG Holdco.

(c) In accordance with the organizational documents of SF Opco, PV IPco and
VMG Splitter LP, VMG Splitter LP shall distribute the Equity Interests to the
partners of VMG Splitter LP (i.e., VMG Blocker Corp. and VMG General
Partner), and VMG Splitter LP shall be dissolved.

Section 6.08 _Commitment Letter_. Parent shall not terminate the Commitment
Letter or amend or modify the Commitment Letter in any manner that would
decrease the amount of the Financing available thereunder, would amend or
modify the conditions precedent or contingencies related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing in any manner adverse to the Sellers or the
Target Companies, or would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent shall promptly notify Sellers in the event any of the
representations and warranties in _Section 5.05_ (Commitment Letter) are no
longer true and correct.

ARTICLE VII

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

Section 7.01 _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary or reasonably required to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, to
take such further action (including the execution and delivery of
such further instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may
request.

Section 7.02 _Press Releases_. From and after the date of this Agreement,
except to the extent required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of
any stock exchange on which Buyer or Parent lists its securities, the Parties
shall not, directly or indirectly, issue any press release or public
announcement of any kind concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Buyer and the Sellers
Representative, and, in the event any such public announcement, press release
or disclosure is required by applicable Law, the Parties will consult prior
to the making thereof to the extent reasonably practicable.

 



40  Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 7.02_ and _Section 7.04_,
on and after the Closing Date, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall be
permitted (i) to provide general information about the subject matter of this
Agreement and the Target Companies in connection with their normal fund
raising, marketing, informational or reporting activities, (ii) to disclose to
their respective and prospective members, limited partners and stockholders
(who may disclose to their direct and indirect investors) the fact that the

directly relating to the Closing Consideration and other types of information
that are customary for private equity funds to provide to their respective and
prospective members, limited partners and stockholders who have executed
customary non-disclosure agreements, (iii) to disclose on their websites and
in their marketing materials the fact of the sale of the Target Companies to

commentary is provided in connection therewith, and (iv) to disclose any
information previously provided as part of a press release, public
announcement or disclosure issued or made in accordance with the first
sentence of this _Section 7.02_. The Parties will consult with each other
concerning the means by which any employee, customer or supplier of any Party
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) or any other Person having
any business relationship with any Party (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries) will be informed of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 7.03  _Transaction Expenses_. Each Party shall be solely responsible
for the payment of any fees and expenses incurred by such Party or its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise required by applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Target Companies shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fees and
expenses incurred by Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or otherwise required by applicable Law;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, in the event of a Closing, the Sellers Representative shall, with the
proceeds from the Closing Consideration, pay all Transaction Expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of whether the Closing occurs, any
fees or expenses of the Target Companies or any of the Sellers incurred by, at
the direction of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including for the purpose of
obtaining any third party consents) shall be paid by Buyer, and the filing
fees required to be paid under the HSR Act shall be paid equally by Sellers,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.

Section 7.04 _Confidentiality_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, the Parties shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Representatives to, keep confidential all information and
materials regarding any other Party reasonably designated by such Party as
confidential at the time of disclosure thereof. Except as provided in _Section
7.02_ (Press Releases), each of the Parties shall, and shall cause its
respective Representatives to not, disclose the terms and provisions of this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. If the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, Buyer and each of
its Representatives shall maintain the confidentiality of all non-public,
proprietary information obtained during its or their due diligence review of
the Target Companies, and shall return to the Target Companies all documents
received from the Target Companies and all copies thereof containing any such
information, in each case pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



41 Section 7.05 _Provision Respecting Representation of the Sellers_. Each of
the Parties hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
members, managers, partners, stockholders, officers, employees and Affiliates,
that Kirkland and Ellis LLP or The Di Salvo Group PLLC may serve as counsel to
each and any Seller, on the one hand, and the Target Companies, on the other
hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Kirkland and Ellis LLP or The Di Salvo Group PLLC (or any of their
respective successors) may serve as counsel to the Sellers in connection with
any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
such representation of the Target Companies, and each of the Parties hereby
consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and
each of such Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising
from such representation. The Parties acknowledge that Kirkland and Ellis LLP
and The Di Salvo Group PLLC have represented and performed services for the
Target Companies prior to the Closing and consent to the sharing by Kirkland and
Ellis LLP or The Di Salvo Group PLLC (or any of their respective successors),
as applicable, with each Seller of all information obtained during such past
representation that Kirkland and Ellis LLP or The Di Salvo Group PLLC (or any of
their respective successors), as applicable, believes to be relevant to any
future dispute or litigation with respect to this Agreement.

Section 7.06 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause each of the
Target Companies and their Affiliates to not, amend, repeal or otherwise
modify the indemnification provisions of any Target Companies Charter Document
as in effect at the Closing in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of individuals who at the Closing were managers, directors,
officers or employees of the Target Companies, except as required by Law. From
and after the Closing, Buyer shall assume, be liable for and honor, guaranty
and stand surety for, and shall cause the Target Companies to honor, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this _Section 7.06_.

(b) For six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer and the Target Companies
shall maintain in effect the Target Companies current managers, directors
and officers liability insurance covering acts or omission occurring prior
to the Closing Date with respect to those Persons who are currently covered by
the Target Companies managers, directors or officers liability insurance
policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable
than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
such directors and officers liability insurance in excess of 200% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Target Companies for such insurance, and,
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Buyer
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and
the Target Companies may fulfill their obligation to provide insurance under
this _Section 7.06(b)_ by obtaining a "tail" policy of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable to the insured than the existing policy, and
maintaining such "tail" policy in full force and effect for a period of at
least six (6) years after the Closing Date. If such

 



42  insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, Buyer and the Target Companies
shall maintain the most advantageous policies of managers, directors and
officers insurance reasonably obtainable.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall not
be required to indemnify any Person for such Persons criminal conduct or
fraud.

Section 7.07 _Post-Closing Record Retention and Access_. From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall provide the Sellers and their authorized Representatives
with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and copying), during
normal business hours, to any books and records and other materials relating
to periods prior to the Closing Date in connection with general purposes,
whether or not relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, with respect to taxable periods
(or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the preparation
of Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns or claim for refund (and any materials
necessary for the preparation of any of the foregoing), and financial
statements for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and the
management and handling of any Action, whether such Action is a matter with
respect to which indemnification may be sought hereunder), or to comply with
the rules and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other Governmental Authority. Buyers obligations
with respect to such books and records shall include maintaining, for a period
of at least seven (7) years following the Closing Date, computer systems
permitting reasonable access to any such books and records which are stored in
electronic form in a fashion which is not materially less efficient than
current access methods. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
Sellers Representative, Buyer shall not, for a period of seven (7) years
following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any books
and records and other materials of the Target Companies, or any portions
thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date without first offering
to surrender to the Sellers Representative such books and records and
materials or such portions thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Buyer and each of the Target Companies shall not be
required to disclose any information to the Sellers or their authorized
Representatives if such disclosure would contravene any Laws or binding
judgments or orders of any Governmental Authority.

 

Section 7.08 _Further Tax Matters_.

(a) _Purchase Price Allocation_. Buyer and the Sellers shall allocate the
Closing Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.05_ (Post Closing
Adjustment), among the Shares as set forth on _Schedule 1.1(c)_. For purposes
of (i) applying Section 751 of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section
1.751-1 in determining the portion of the gain or loss recognized by each
holder of Shares upon the sale of such holders Shares pursuant to this
Agreement that is attributable to the Target Companies "unrealized
receivables" and "inventory items" (as such terms are defined in Section 751
of the Code), (ii) computing special basis adjustments under Section 743 of
the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.743-1, (iii) allocating such
special basis adjustments among the assets of the Target Companies under
Section 755 of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.755-1 and (iv) for
all other Tax purposes, the respective gross fair market values of the Target
Companies assets will be determined by an appraisal completed by an
independent valuation firm of recognized national standing (the " _Valuation
Firm_ "), which shall be completed and submitted to Buyer and the Sellers
Representative on or before

 



43  December 15, 2012. The appraisal provided by the Valuation Firm shall be
modified, as appropriate, by the Valuation Firm to reflect any adjustments in
the Closing Consideration made following the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement. The Valuation Firms fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with preparing the appraisal shall be borne by Buyer. The Parties
will prepare and file all Tax Returns (including the statement required by
Treasury Regulations Section 1.743-1(k) and Internal Revenue Service Form
8308) in a manner consistent with this _Section 7.08(a)_, such allocation of
the Closing Consideration, and the fair market values so determined, and
neither Buyer nor the Sellers, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall
take any Tax position that is inconsistent with this _Section 7.08(a)_, such
allocation of the Closing Consideration, or such fair market values unless
required to do so by applicable Law.

(b) _Closing of Taxable Years_. The Parties agree that, as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the taxable year of the
Target Companies shall terminate for federal and, unless required by
applicable Tax Law, any applicable state and local income Tax purposes as of
11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date.

(c) _Tax Returns_. Following the Closing, the Sellers Representative shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for the Target Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are not filed on
or before the Closing Date and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown
as due thereon. Buyer and the Target Companies shall cooperate with the
Sellers Representative in preparing and filing such Tax Returns, including
providing records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax
Returns, making employees and third-party advisors available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided, and signing and delivering to the Sellers Representative
for filing any Tax Returns prepared in accordance with this  _Section 7.08_
that are required to be signed by Buyer or any Target Company. Buyer and the
Sellers Representative agree that such Tax Returns shall include as an income
Tax deduction on or before the Closing Date (x) the amount of any Transaction
Expenses (to the extent such amounts are deductible, taking into account the
safe harbor contained in IRS Revenue Procedure 2011-29), (y) the employer
portion of any employment Taxes on any Transaction Expenses, and (z) the
amount of any deferred financing fees written off in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively for clauses (x) and (y), the "
_Transaction Tax Deductions_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event
that such Transaction Tax Deductions are required to be deferred to a date
after the Closing Date as a result of any Tax audit or other Tax proceeding,
Buyer shall pay an additional amount to the Sellers Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) equal to the amount of such Transaction Tax Deductions
multiplied by 40%, when such Transaction Tax Deductions are actually realized
and received by the Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) in cash or cash
equivalents (after first taking into account such Transaction Tax Deductions
before taking into account any other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit). To the extent not discussed in the immediately preceding sentence,
such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Target Companies, except as otherwise required by applicable
Tax Law or changes in facts; provided that, with respect to any particular
item, there is at least substantial authority within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation section 1.6662-4(d) for such treatment of the item. In the event
that the most recent past practice with respect to the treatment of any item
does not meet the foregoing standards, the item shall be addressed and
reflected in the applicable Tax Return in a manner that is more likely than
not correct. The Sellers Representative shall provide Buyer with drafts of
any such Tax Returns 

 



44  that are Income Tax Returns no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date thereof (taking into account any extensions thereof) and shall permit
Buyer to review and comment on such Tax Returns. The Sellers Representative
shall consider in good faith any comments made by Buyer on such Income Tax
Returns that are provided by Buyer to the Sellers Representative in writing
within ten (10) days of receipt of such draft Tax Returns from the Sellers
Representative. If Buyer and the Sellers Representative disagree about
whether any such comments should be accepted, the Accounting Firm shall
resolve such disagreement in accordance with the provisions of  _Section
7.08(k)_ (Dispute Resolution). The Parties agree and acknowledge that the
federal Income Tax Returns of the Target Companies for the Tax period that
ends on the Closing Date will include an election under Section 754 of
the Code and, to the extent applicable, an analogous election will be made in
each of the state and local Income Tax Returns of the Target Companies for
that Tax period. With respect to any such Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that are not Income Tax Returns, the Sellers Representative will
provide Buyer with drafts of such Tax Returns no later than fifteen (15) days
prior to the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions thereof) and
the Sellers Representative shall consider in good faith any comments made by
Buyer on such Tax Returns that are received in writing by Sellers
Representative within five (5) days of Buyers receipt of such draft Tax
Returns. If Buyer and the Sellers Representative disagree about whether any
such comments should be accepted, the Accounting Firm shall resolve such
disagreement in accordance with the provisions of _Section 7.08(k)_ (Dispute
Resolution). For avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.08(c)_ shall apply to
any information returns (such as IRS Forms 1099) filed or issued with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Target Companies. In the case of any
Straddle Period Return of any of the Target Companies, the Sellers
Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared the portion of such
Straddle Period Return ending on the Closing Date and provide such portion to
Buyer for inclusion on such Straddle Period Return, and shall pay or cause to
be paid all Taxes allocable to such portion of such Straddle Period Returns
ending on the Closing Date, in accordance with the preceding provisions of
this _Section 7.08(c)_.

 

(d) _Straddle Period_. Taxes for any Tax period of the Target Companies that
includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall
be allocated for all purposes of this Agreement (i) to the Sellers for the
portion of the Tax period up to and including the Closing Date and (ii) to
Buyer for the portion of the Tax period subsequent to the Closing Date. For
that purpose, (A) real, personal and intangible property Taxes and any other
Taxes levied on an annual or other periodic basis (" _Per Diem Taxes_ ") of
the Target Companies for a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the
periods described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence on a per
diem basis based on the number of days during the Straddle Period ending with
and including the Closing Date and number of days during the Straddle Period
commencing on the day after the Closing Date, and (B) Taxes that are not Per
Diem Taxes, including income Taxes and any transactional Taxes such as Taxes
based on sales, revenue or payments of the Target Companies for a Straddle
Period shall be allocated between the periods described in clauses (i) and
(ii) of the preceding sentence as if such Tax period ended as of the end of
the Closing Date. For purposes of clause (B) of the preceding sentence, any
allocation of gross or net income or deductions or other items required to
determine any Taxes attributable to such a Straddle Period shall be made by
means of a closing of the books and records of the Target Companies as of end
of the Closing Date, provided that exemptions, allowances, deductions or
periodic Taxes (such as property Taxes) that are calculated on an annual basis
(including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions)
shall be allocated 

 



45  between the period ending as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such period; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any Taxes attributable
to any actions not in the Ordinary Course of Business that are taken after the
Closing on the Closing Date shall be allocated to Buyer.

 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All sales and transfer taxes, recording charges and
similar taxes, fees or charges imposed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
together with any interest, penalties or additions to such Transfer Taxes,
shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by the Sellers. The Sellers and
Buyer shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and
forms as necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of all
applicable Tax Laws in connection with the payment of such Transfer Taxes, and
shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the fullest extent possible
under such Tax Laws, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable in
connection therewith.

(f) _Tax Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations in ARTICLE X
(Indemnification), the Sellers shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify
Buyer and its Affiliates from and against all liability for (i) Taxes of the
Target Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date (determined in
accordance with _Section 7.08(d)_ (Straddle Period)), (ii) Transfer Taxes
(together with any interest, penalties or additions to such Transfer Taxes)
that are the responsibility of the Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.08(e)_
(Transfer Taxes), and (iii) any Taxes required to be withheld from any
payment to any Seller under this Agreement or the Working Capital Escrow
Agreement which the Sellers Representative fails to withhold pursuant to
_Section 2.06_ (Withholding Rights) and which are asserted by
any Governmental Authority to be the responsibility of Buyer. In the case of
a Tax that is contested in accordance with the provisions of _Section
7.08(i)_ (Tax Proceedings), payment of the Tax to the appropriate Governmental
Authority shall not be considered to be due earlier than the date a final
determination to such effect is made by the appropriate Governmental Authority
or court unless payment of the Tax is required as a condition to a contest.

 

(g) _Tax Refunds_. The Sellers shall be entitled to any refunds received for
federal, state, local or foreign Taxes paid for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date
(determined in accordance with _Section 7.08(d)_ (Straddle Period)) of the
Target Companies, along with any interest paid with respect thereto by the
relevant Taxing Authority. Buyer shall cause any such refunds (including
interest) to which the Sellers are entitled that are received by the Target
Companies or any Affiliate thereof after the Closing Date, whether by offset,
credit, receipt of payment or otherwise, to be paid promptly to the Sellers
Representative on behalf of the Sellers, net of all out-of-pocket expenses
(including Taxes) incurred by Buyer, the Target Companies, or any Affiliate
thereof with respect thereto.

(h) _Certain Tax Agreements_. Sellers shall terminate or shall cause to be
terminated on or prior to the Closing Date any Tax sharing, Tax allocation,
powers of attorney relating to Taxes or Tax indemnity agreements to which any
of the Target Companies is a party, except as otherwise expressly contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



46 (i) _Tax Proceedings_. If a claim shall be made by any Governmental Authority
in respect of the Target Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall
promptly and in any event no more than ten (10) days following Buyers receipt
of such claim, give written notice to the Sellers Representative of such
claim; provided, however, that the failure of Buyer to give such notices
shall only relieve the Sellers from their indemnification obligations
hereunder to the extent of increased Taxes actually resulting from such
failure. With respect to any Tax claim relating solely to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, the Sellers Representative shall control all proceedings and may make
all decisions taken in connection with such Tax claim (including selection of
counsel or any accounting firm) at the Sellers expense (based on their
respective Percentage Allocations). Buyer shall control at its own expense all
proceedings taken in connection with any Tax claim relating to the Target
Companies during any Straddle Period and in connection with any Tax claim
relating to the Target Companies for a Tax period beginning after the Closing
Date. The Sellers Representative shall promptly notify Buyer if it decides
not to control the defense or settlement of any Tax claim for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period which it is entitled to control pursuant to this Agreement. No Tax
claim for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the Sellers Representative is
entitled to control all proceedings may be settled without the written
consent of Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Buyer, the Sellers, the Sellers Representative, the Target Companies and each
of their respective Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
contesting any Tax claim in accordance with this _Section 7.08(i)_ and shall
keep each other reasonably informed concerning the progress of proceedings
related to Tax claims for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Subject to the foregoing,
(i) in the case of a Tax claim for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the
Sellers Representative is entitled to control all proceedings, Buyer may
participate in such proceedings (including through its own counsel) at Buyers
expense, and (ii) in the case of a Tax claim for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for
which Buyer is entitled to control all proceedings, the Sellers
Representative may participate in such proceedings (including through its own
counsel) at the Sellers expense. The Parties shall satisfy their indemnity
obligations pursuant to _Section 7.08(f)_ (Tax Indemnification) within ten
(10) days after a final determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code or analogous provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law) or
settlement of the relevant Tax claim is made.

(j) _Cooperation_. Buyer, the Target Companies, the Sellers and the Sellers
Representative and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other Parties, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this  _Section 7.08_, any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, and other Tax matters
addressed by this _Section 7.08_. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another Partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax matters and making
employees and third-party advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
cooperation as necessary so that the Tax Returns described in _Section
7.08(c)_ (Tax Returns) can be filed no later than January 15, 2013. 

(k) _Dispute Resolution_. Except as provided by _Section 7.08(a)_ (Purchase
Price Allocation) or with respect to matters addressed by _Section 7.08(i)_
(Tax Proceedings), any dispute, controversy or claim between Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Sellers or the Sellers Representative, on the other hand,
arising out of or relating to the provisions of this Agreement

 



47  that relates to Taxes that cannot be resolved by negotiations between Buyer
and the Sellers Representative shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution in the same manner in which disputes are handled pursuant to
_Section 2.05_ (Post Closing Adjustment).

Section 7.09  _Financing_.

(a) Buyer agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Financing, including the satisfaction of all conditions under the Commitment
Letter (to the extent such fulfillment is within the control of Buyer or its
Affiliates). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer agrees to
use, and to cause each of its Affiliates to use, all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause their respective employees, counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other representatives to cooperate with each other in the
preparation of all documents and the making of all filings in connection with
the Financing and the transactions contemplated by Financing, and in executing
and delivering all documents and instruments and otherwise taking, or causing
to be taken, all actions and doing, or causing to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Financing and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers shall provide, and shall cause
the Target Companies and Sellers and the Target Companies respective
officers, auditors and legal advisors to provide during normal business
hours, such reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, including participating in
meetings and presentations, providing information and documents, and other
actions that are or may be customary in connection with comparable financing
transactions or necessary to permit Buyer to fulfill conditions or obligations
under the Commitment Letter.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions in this Agreement,
neither Buyer nor Parent nor any of their Affiliates will be required to
commence, join, initiate or otherwise prosecute any kind of proceeding against
any Financing Source with respect to the Financing, including but not limited
to any lender or arranger described in, or any other party to, the
Commitment Letter.

Section 7.10 _Exclusivity_. The Sellers have been in negotiations with other
parties concerning a possible sale of the Target Companies, and such other
parties have obtained certain information relating thereto. As of the date
hereof, the Sellers agree to immediately terminate, and to cause their
affiliates, representatives, agents, officers, employees, attorneys and
accountants to terminate, all existing negotiations or activities with any
party other than Buyer, its Affiliates and their Representatives. The Sellers
agree that they will not and will not permit their Affiliates or
their Affiliates officers, directors, employees, advisors or other agents or
representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, entertain, initiate
or encourage any inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person relating to
any acquisition of the Shares or the Target Companies or all or substantially
all of the assets of the Target Companies (other than the inventory of the
Target Companies in the Ordinary Course of Business or obsolete equipment) or
any divestiture, merger, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, redemption or similar transaction involving the Sellers or
any Target Company, or (ii) with respect to any effort or attempt by any other
Person to do or seek any of the foregoing, (A) participate in any discussions
or negotiations with such other Person, (B) furnish to any other Person any
confidential information with respect to the Target Companies in connection
with any such effort or (C) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or
participate in, or

 



48  facilitate or encourage any such effort, in any such case described in
clause (i) or (ii), other than with Buyer, its Affiliates and their
Representatives. If any Person makes any such effort described in clause (ii)
of the immediately preceding sentence, the Sellers Representative will
immediately notify Buyer.

Section 7.11 _Employee Matters_. Buyer shall be solely responsible for
complying with the requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code for any individual who is an "MandA qualified
beneficiary" as defined in QandA-4 of Treas. Reg. §54.4980B-9 in connection with

Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE X_ for any Damages, appropriate
reductions shall be made to reflect the recovery pursuant to any insurance
policy actually received by any Indemnified Party in respect of such Damages,
net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such
recovery. If an indemnification payment is received by any Indemnified Party,
and such Indemnified Party later actually receives insurance recoveries, as
described in the immediately preceding sentence, in respect of the related
Damages or indemnification payments that were not previously accounted for
with respect to such Damages or indemnification payments when made, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, and promptly,
but in any event no later than five (5) days after delivery of such notice by
such Indemnified Party, pay (or cause the Escrow Agent to pay from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds) to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to
the lesser of (A) any such net insurance recoveries and (B) the actual amount
of the indemnification payments previously paid by the Indemnifying Party with
respect to such Damages. Solely for purposes of calculating the amount of
Damages incurred out of or relating to any breach of a representation or
warranty (and not for purposes of determining whether or not a breach has
occurred), the references to "Material Adverse Effect" or other
materiality qualifications (or correlative terms) shall be disregarded.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the De
Minimis Amount, Deductible Amount, Indemnity Cap and the limitations on the
survival period set forth in _Section 10.01_ shall not apply with respect to
fraud

Section 10.05 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, each Party
acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and
transactions contemplated hereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification set
forth in _Section 7.08(f)_ (Tax Indemnification) and this _ARTICLE X_. In
furtherance of the foregoing, but without limiting the rights of
indemnification expressly provided for under _Section 7.08(f)_ (Tax
Indemnification), _Section 10.02_ (Indemnification by the Sellers) and
_Section 10.03_ (Indemnification by Buyer) (and subject to the other
provisions of this _ARTICLE X_ ), each Indemnified Party hereby waives, from
and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
any and all rights, claims and causes of action (including any right, whether
arising at Law or in equity, to seek indemnification, contribution, cost
recovery, damages or any other recourse or remedy, including

 



56  the remedy of rescission and remedies that may arise under common law) it
may have against any Indemnifying Party whether arising under or based upon
any federal, state, local or foreign Law (including any Environmental
Requirements) or otherwise. Nothing in this _Section 10.05_ shall limit any
Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief on account of any
partys fraud.

 

Section 10.06 _Procedures for Third-Party Claims_. In the event that an
Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for Damages against an
Indemnifying Party arising from a claim of a third party (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing, and in reasonable detail (including, to the extent
reasonably ascertainable, the amount of such claim, the nature and basis of
such claim and the relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto), of the
Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt by such
Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim; provided that failure
or delay in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that such failure has
adversely affected the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of the
Third-Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this  _Section
10.06_, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party, in each case at its expense, so long as (i) the Third-
Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or
other equitable relief, and (ii) the Third-Party Claim for indemnification
does not relate to or arise in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation. If the Indemnifying Party
shall assume the control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.06_, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and
to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if there exists a conflict of interest
(including the availability of one or more legal defenses to the Indemnified
Party which are not available to the Indemnifying Party) that would make it
inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party (upon and in
conformity with advice of counsel) for the same counsel to represent both
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
will be entitled to retain one counsel (plus one local counsel in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is necessary),
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, provided that the Indemnified Party and such counsel will
contest such Third-Party Claims in good faith. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this _ARTICLE X_ , the Indemnifying Party shall also be liable for
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party
for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has elected not to assume
the defense thereof. Each Party shall cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of such
Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Partys request) the provision by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Third-Party Claim, and making personnel available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. No compromise or settlement of any Third-Party
Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Partys consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided that no such consent shall be required if (i) there is no
finding or admission of any violation of Law by the Indemnified Party

 



57  and no effect on any other claims that may be made against such Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates, (ii) each Indemnified Party that is party to such
Third-Party Claim is fully and unconditionally released from liability with
respect to such claim and (iii) no damages other than monetary damages are
paid with regard to such Third-Party Claim. No Indemnified Party shall settle
or compromise any Third-Party Claim without the express prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, unless the Indemnified Party waives its rights to
indemnification hereunder with respect to such Third-Party Claim; provided
that it shall be reasonable for the Indemnifying Party to withhold any such
consent if such settlement or compromise creates any liability or obligation
on the part of such Indemnifying Party or otherwise affects any claims that
are then pending or threatened, or may be made, against such Indemnifying
Party. Where the provisions of this _Section 10.06_ conflict with the
provisions of _Section 7.08(i)_ (Tax Proceedings), the provisions of 
_Section 7.08(i)_ (Tax Proceedings) shall control.

Section 10.07 _Procedures for Inter-Party Claims_. In the event that an
Indemnified Party determines that it has a claim for Damages against an
Indemnifying Party hereunder (other than as a result of a Third-Party Claim),
the Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice thereof to
the Indemnifying Party, specifying the amount of such claim, the nature and
basis of the alleged breach giving rise to such claim and all relevant facts
and circumstances relating thereto. Failure or delay in notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that such failure has adversely affected the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The Indemnified Party shall
provide the Indemnifying Party with access to its books and records during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior written notice for the purpose
of allowing the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to verify any
such claim for Damages and shall make its personnel available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such
notice and granting of such access if the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE X_. If the Indemnifying
Party does not so notify the Indemnified Party, the claim specified by the
Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed to be a
liability of the Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE X_ , and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay (or, if applicable, cause the Escrow Agent to
pay from the Indemnification Escrow Funds) the amount of such liability to the
Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount
of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is estimated, on such later
date when the amount of such claim (or such portion of such claim) becomes
finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim as provided above, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute. Following the final determination of the amount of Damages to which
the Indemnified Party is entitled (whether determined in accordance with this
_Section 10.07_ or by arbitration), the Indemnifying Party shall, no later
than three (3) Business Days following such final determination, pay (or, if
applicable, cause the Escrow Agent to pay from the Indemnification Escrow
Funds) such Damages to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer or certified
check made payable to the order of the Indemnified Party. Where the provisions
of this _Section 10.07_ conflict with the provisions of _Section 7.08(i)_
(Tax Proceedings), the provisions of  _Section 7.08(i)_ (Tax Proceedings)
shall control.

 



58 Section 10.08 _Duty to Mitigate_. The Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or otherwise reduce the amount of
any Damages that it incurs in connection with any matter with respect to which
it is entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed
pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_. The costs and expenses of such mitigation
efforts shall be included in the Indemnified Partys Damages for which the
Indemnified Party will become entitled to be held harmless, indemnified,
compensated or reimbursed pursuant to this  _ARTICLE X_.

Section 10.09 _No Punitive Damages_ _; No Consequential Damages on IP_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Person shall
be liable to or otherwise responsible for punitive or exemplary damages or any
other damages other than those that directly arise from the underlying breach
or are the reasonably foreseeable result of such breach. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Person shall be liable to or
otherwise responsible for consequential, special, indirect or incidental
damages, diminution in value or lost profits or any damages measured by lost
profits or a multiple of earnings suffered or paid, directly or indirectly, as
a result of, in connection with, relating to or arising from the breach by the
Target Companies of the Intellectual Property Representation or any other
representation or warranty made by the Target Companies or the Sellers in this
Agreement where the underlying claim directly or indirectly relates to
Intellectual Property.

 

Section 10.10 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Following the Closing, any
payment made pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_  shall be treated by the Parties,
for federal income Tax and other applicable Tax purposes, as an adjustment to
the cash proceeds received by the Sellers in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

Section 10.11 _Sellers  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, to the extent any Seller is a "Buyer Indemnified Party" (as
that term is defined in Unit Purchase and Recapitalization Agreement, dated as
of July 20, 2009, among SF Holdco and the other parties thereto), such Seller
shall retain and be permitted to exercise his, her or its third party
beneficiary rights under such agreement, and Buyer shall take no action to
terminate, modify, amend or reduce such rights.

ARTICLE XI

_MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 11.01 _Sellers  Representative_.

(a) Each Seller, by virtue of his, her or its execution and delivery of this
Agreement, hereby irrevocably nominates, constitutes and appoints the Sellers
Representative as the agent, agent for service of process and true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of the Sellers, with full power of substitution, to act in
the name, place and stead of such Seller with respect to this Agreement and
the taking by the Sellers Representative of any and all actions and the
making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken or made by the
Sellers Representative under this Agreement including the exercise of the
power to: (i) execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file (in the name of
any or all of the Sellers or otherwise) any and all documents, including
without limitation the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and the
Indemnification Escrow

 



59  Agreement, and to take any and all actions that the Sellers Representative
may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or
appropriate in connection with any matter covered in _Section 2.05_ (Post
Closing Adjustment) or any indemnification claim under _ARTICLE X_
(Indemnification) (including negotiating, entering into compromises or
settlements of and demanding arbitration with respect to any such matters
covered in _Section 2.05_ (Post Closing Adjustment) or any indemnification
claim, as applicable); (ii) update the Percentage Allocations in _Schedule
1.1(c)_ ; (iii) give and receive notices and communications under this
Agreement, the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement; and (iv) take such actions as the Managing Member or Board of
Managers under the organizational documents of SF Holdco would be permitted
to take (subject to the terms of such organizational documents as they exist
immediately prior to Closing). The Sellers Representative hereby accepts its
appointment as the Sellers Representative.

 

(b) The power of attorney granted in this _Section 11.01_ (i) is coupled with
an interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Sellers
Representative; and (iii) shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution or
liquidation of each of the Sellers.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Buyer shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Sellers Representative
on all matters relating to  _Section 2.05_ (Post Closing Adjustment), the
Working Capital Escrow Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, and
each Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Sellers Representative on all matters relating to _ARTICLE X_
(Indemnification), and each of them shall be entitled to rely conclusively
(without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or
purported to be executed on behalf of any Seller by the Sellers
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Seller by the Sellers Representative, as fully binding upon
such Seller. Each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to
any payments hereunder which are payable by Buyer to the Sellers
Representative, so long as Buyer pays the Sellers Representative the amount
owed hereunder, such Seller shall not bring any Action against Buyer with
respect to the amount such Seller receives from the Sellers Representative
(including any adjustments to such Sellers Percentage Allocations set forth
on _Schedule 1.1(c)_ ).

(d) The Sellers Representative may at any time designate a replacement
Sellers Representative and each Seller, by virtue of his, her or its
execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby consents to such replacement
Sellers Representative. If the Sellers Representative shall dissolve or
liquidate or otherwise become unable to fulfill its responsibilities as
representative of the Sellers, then the Sellers shall, by "majority vote"
within 30 days after such dissolution, liquidation or other event, appoint a
successor representative. After any such replacement or appointment of a
successor pursuant to this _Section 11.01_, the successor representative
shall provide prompt written notice thereof to Buyer. Until such notice is
received by Buyer, the Buyer will be entitled to rely on the actions of the
previous Sellers Representative. Any such successor shall become
the "Sellers Representative" for purposes of this Agreement. If for any
reason there is no Sellers Representative at any time, all references herein
to the Sellers Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Sellers. 

(e) No bond shall be required of the Sellers Representative, and the Sellers
Representative shall receive no compensation for its services. The Sellers
Representative shall

 



60  not be liable to any Seller for any act done or omitted hereunder as the
Sellers Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of its
reasonable business judgment with respect to any matter arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder (it
being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith). The Sellers
Representative shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Sellers, on a joint
and several basis, for any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Sellers Representative
with respect to any matter arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of its duties hereunder. The Sellers Representative shall
be entitled to recover from the Sellers, on a joint and several basis, any
out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Sellers
Representative in good faith and in connection with actions taken by the
Sellers Representative pursuant to this Agreement (including the hiring of
legal counsel and the incurring of legal fees and costs). The Sellers
Representative shall keep reasonably detailed records of the costs and
expenses for which it seeks reimbursement as herein provided.

 

Section 11.02 _No Third Party Beneficiaries; Financing Sources_. Except as set
forth in _Section 7.08(f)_ (Tax Indemnification), _Section 7.06_
(Directors and Officers Indemnification), _Section 10.02_ (Indemnification
by the Sellers) and _Section 10.03_ (Indemnification by Buyer), each of which
is expressly intended for the benefit of the Persons referenced therein, and
except that _Section 7.09(b)_, this _Section 11.02_, _Section 11.05(b)_,
_Section 11.09_, _Section 11.10(b)_, _Section 11.10(c)_ and  _Section
11.11_ of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources,
this Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer any rights or
remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Financing Sources_ " shall mean each of the agents, arrangers, lenders and
other entities that have committed to provide or arrange or otherwise entered
into agreements in connection with the Financing. None of Seller, any Target
Company or any of their Representatives shall have any rights or claims
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment
Letter, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. This _Section
11.02_ is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Financing Sources.

 

Section 11.03 _Equitable Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, prior to the Closing, the Target Companies and the Sellers, on the
one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, hereby agree that in the event any of
the Target Companies or the Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other
hand violate any provisions of this Agreement, the remedies at Law available
to Buyer, on the one hand, and the Target Companies and the Sellers, on the
other hand, may be inadequate. In such event, the Target Companies and the
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall have the right,
in addition to all other rights and remedies they may have, to specific
performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce or prevent
any violations by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Target Companies or any of
the Sellers, on the other hand.

Section 11.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits and
Schedules (including Disclosure Schedules), and the documents referred to
herein constitute the entire agreement among the Parties and supersede any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, that may have related in any way to the subject matter
hereof.

 



61 Section 11.05 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned (i) by
any Party other than Buyer without the prior written consent of Buyer or (ii)
by Buyer without the written consent of the Sellers Representative, except
that (a) Buyer may assign its right to purchase Shares hereunder in whole or
in part to its Parent or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative, and (b) Buyer may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement in whole or in part through a collateral assignment to any lender
providing financing in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that any such assignment by
Buyer or Parent shall not relieve the assigning party of its obligations under
this Agreement.

 

Section 11.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any
amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of digital
imaging and electronic mail or a facsimile machine, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person.

 

Section 11.07 _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 11.08 _Notices_. All notices, requests, consents, waivers and other

Section 11.09 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any Action brought
pursuant to _Section_ _11.10(b)_

 



63  (Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial), this Agreement and any
disputes arising under or related hereto (whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise) shall be governed and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to its conflicts of
law principles (other than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law of
the State of New York).

 

Section 11.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Each Party irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware or the Circuit Court of
Delaware in respect of any disputes or claims under _Section 7.04_
(Confidentiality) or with respect to which a party otherwise seeks equitable
remedies pursuant to _Section 11.03_ (Equitable Remedies). Each Party
further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
U.S. registered mail to such Partys respective address set forth in _Section
11.08_ (Notices) above shall be effective service of process for any action,
suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section 11.10_. Each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of the matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section 11.10_ in the U.S. District Court
for the District of Delaware or the Circuit Court of Delaware, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

(b) Each Party agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).
Each Party further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by U.S. registered mail to such Partys respective address set forth
in _Section 11.08_ (Notices) above shall be effective service of process for
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim brought
pursuant to this  _Section 11.10(b)_. Each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim arising out of the
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section 11.10(b)_
in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if
under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof), and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any such
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law.

 



64 (c) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS OF TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY
FINANCING SOURCE.

Section 11.11 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or modification of any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by Buyer and the Sellers Representative or, in the case of a
waiver, by the Buyer or Sellers Representative, as the case may be, waiving
compliance; and _Section 11.02_ and this _Section 11.11_ may not be amended,
modified or waived without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.
No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

Section 11.12 _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and
Schedules (including Disclosure Schedules) identified in this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

Section 11.13 _Construction_. Where specific language is used to clarify by
example a general statement contained herein, such specific language shall not
be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the construction of the
general statement to which it relates. The language used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their
mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against
any Party.

Section 11.14 _Interpretation_. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise
requires, (i) words of any gender include each other gender or the neuter;
(ii) words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or
singular number, respectively; (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby"

will be given independent significance of fact and will not be deemed
superseded or modified by any other such representation or warranty.

 

Section 11.15 _Disclosure Schedules_. The information set forth in each
section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement (the "
_Disclosure Schedules_ ") shall be deemed to provide the information
contemplated by, or otherwise qualify, the representations and warranties of
the Target Companies and the Sellers set forth in the corresponding section
or subsection of this Agreement and any other section or subsection of this
Agreement only to the extent it is reasonably apparent from a reasonable
reading of the Disclosure Schedules and such other section of this Agreement
that such disclosure is also applicable to such other section of this
Agreement and regardless of whether such section or subsection of this
Agreement is qualified by reference to the Disclosure Schedules.

 



65 Section 11.16 _Arbitration_.

 

(a) Except for disputes and claims under _Section 7.04_ (Confidentiality) or
with respect to which a party otherwise seeks equitable remedies pursuant to
_Section 11.03_ (Equitable Remedies) (which may be pursued in a court of
competent jurisdiction as provided in _Section 11.10_ (Consent to
Jurisdiction)), and disputes under _Section 2.05_ (Post Closing Adjustment),
_Section 7.08(a)_ (Purchase Price Allocation) and _Section 7.08(k)_ (Dispute
Resolution) (which disputes shall be governed by the provisions of such
Sections), each party agrees that arbitration administered by the American
Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules
(the " _AAA Rules_ ") shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any
claim or dispute (" _Claim_ ") arising out of or relating to the rights and
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement, whether such Claim arose or
the facts on which such Claim is based occurred prior to or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Parties hereto agree that (i) one arbitrator shall be appointed
pursuant to the AAA Rules to conduct any such arbitration, (ii) such
arbitrator shall have at least 15 years of experience, whether as an attorney
or as a neutral arbitrator, with respect to equity purchase agreements and
complex commercial contracts, and (iii) all meetings of the Parties and
all hearings with respect to any such arbitration shall take place in New
York, New York, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties and the arbitrator.

(c) In addition, the Parties hereto agree that (i) the arbitrator shall have
no authority to make any decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other
determination that does not conform to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (as executed and delivered by the Parties hereto), (ii) the
arbitrator shall have no greater authority to award any relief than a court
having proper jurisdiction pursuant to _Section 11.10_ (Consent to
Jurisdiction) and (iii) the arbitrator shall have no authority to commit an
Error of Law (as defined below) in his or her decision, judgment, ruling,
finding, award or other determination, and on appeal from or motion to vacate
or confirm such decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other
determination, a court having proper jurisdiction pursuant to _Section 11.10_
(Consent to Jurisdiction) may vacate any such decision, judgment, ruling,
finding, award or other determination to the extent containing an Error of
Law. For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Error of Law_ " means any decision,
judgment, ruling, finding, award or other determination that is inconsistent
with the Laws governing this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.09_
(Governing Law). Any decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other
determination of the arbitrator and any information disclosed in the course of
any arbitration hereunder (collectively, the " _Arbitration Information_ ")
shall be kept confidential by the Parties subject to _Section 11.16(d)_, and
any appeal from or motion to vacate or confirm such decision, judgment,
ruling, finding, award or other determination shall be filed under seal.

(d) In the event that any party or any of such partys Affiliates, associates
or representatives is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Arbitration
Information (the " _Disclosing Party_ "), such Disclosing Party shall

 



66  notify the other Parties promptly of the request or requirement so that the
other Parties may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance
with the provisions of this  _Section 11.16_. If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Disclosing Party or
any of its Affiliates, associates or representatives believes in good faith,
upon the advice of legal counsel, that it is compelled to disclose any such
Arbitration Information, such Disclosing Party may disclose such portion of
the Arbitration Information as it believes in good faith, upon the advice of
legal counsel, it is required to disclose; provided that the Disclosing Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and
expense of the other Parties, an order or other assurance that confidential
treatment shall be accorded to such portion of the Arbitration Information
required to be disclosed as the other Parties shall designate.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 11.16_ to the contrary, the Parties
shall have no obligation to keep confidential any Arbitration Information that
becomes generally known to and available for use by the public other than as
a result of the disclosing partys acts or omissions or the acts or omissions
of such partys Affiliates, associates or representatives. The Parties agree
that, subject to the right of any party to appeal or move to vacate or
confirm any decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other determination
of an arbitration as provided in this _Section 11.16_, the decision,
judgment, ruling, finding, award or other determination of any arbitration
under the AAA Rules shall be final, conclusive and binding on all of the
Parties hereto; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 11.16_ shall
prohibit any party hereto from instituting litigation to enforce any final
decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other determination of the
arbitration.

Section 11.17 _Costs and Expenses_. In the event of any action for
indemnification arising under _ARTICLE X_ (Indemnification), the prevailing
party shall be entitled to, and the non-prevailing party shall pay to the
prevailing party, the costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of
legal counsel) incurred by the prevailing party in connection with enforcing
its rights or defending claims hereunder. In the event of any arbitration
pursuant to _Section 11.16_ (Arbitration), each party to the arbitration
shall bear its own costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of
legal counsel, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law), and
all costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding (such as filing fees,
the arbitrators fees, hearing expenses, etc.) shall be borne equally by the
parties to the arbitration; provided, however, that the arbitrator shall, in
the award, allocate all such costs and expenses against the non-prevailing
party. Any costs and expenses payable by any Seller Indemnifying Party
pursuant to _ARTICLE X_ (Indemnification) or _Section 11.16_ (Arbitration)
shall first be paid from the Indemnification Escrow Funds (in an amount not to
exceed such Seller Indemnifying Partys pro rata portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds based on such Seller Indemnifying Partys
Percentage Allocation), and thereafter, directly from such Seller Indemnifying
Party.

 

Section 11.18 _Parent Guaranty_.

(a) Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary
obligor and not as surety, the due and punctual payment and performance by
Buyer (and any permitted assignees thereof) of all of its obligations to the
Target Companies, the Sellers and the Sellers Representative pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). The foregoing
sentence is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full
and punctual discharge and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. Should
Buyer default in the discharge or performance of all or any portion of the
Guaranteed Obligations, the obligations of Parent hereunder shall
become immediately due and payable.

 



67 (b) Parent hereby represents and warrants to the Target Companies, the Sellers
and the Sellers Representative that (i) it is a corporation duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of North
Carolina, and it has all power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this _Section 11.18_; (ii) the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by it has been duly and validly authorized and
approved by all necessary corporate action, and no other proceedings or
actions on the part of it are necessary therefor; (iii) this Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by it and, assuming that this
Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the other parties hereto,
constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of it, enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting creditors rights and general
principles of equity affecting the availability of specific performance and
other equitable remedies; (iv) no litigation, investigation or proceeding of
or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to its
knowledge, threatened by or against it with respect to any of the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 11.18_; and (v) it will have at
the Closing sufficient funds immediately available to pay and perform all of
its obligations under this _Section 11.18_.

 

Section 11.19 _Release by the Sellers; Covenant Not To Sue_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, each of the Sellers, on behalf of
themselves and, as applicable, their employees, officers, managers,
equityholders, members, directors, shareholders, representatives, agents,
successors, predecessors, affiliates, attorneys and assigns (the " _Seller
Related Parties_ "), hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges
Buyer, each of the Target Companies, any Subsidiaries of any Target Company
and their respective employees, officers, directors, representatives, agents,
successors, predecessors, affiliates, attorneys and assigns (collectively, the
" _Released Parties_ "), from any and all claims, rights, demands, causes of
action, suits, debts, obligations, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees), whether based on federal, state, local,
statutory or common law or any other law, rule, or regulation, of any kind,
nature and/or description, matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated,
accrued or unaccrued, actual or potential, known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, contingent or non-contingent, whether or not asserted,
threatened, alleged or litigated, at law, equity or otherwise (collectively, "
_Release Claims_ "), arising out of, relating to, or resulting from any
circumstances, conduct, facts, events, transactions, acts, occurrences,
statements, representations, misrepresentations or omissions, errors,
negligence, breach of contract, tort, violation of law, matter or cause
occurring or arising prior to or on the Closing Date and arising from or
related in any way to the ownership, management or operation of any Target
Company or any Subsidiaries of any Target Company on or prior to the Closing
Date, which any of the Sellers or any of the Seller Related Parties has had,
now has, or may have in the future against the Released Parties, whether
known or unknown, except only the Seller Excluded Claims (the foregoing
release being the " _Seller Release_ ").

(b) For the purpose of the Seller Release, " _Seller Excluded Claims_ " means
any Release Claims by any Seller or Seller Related Party arising under (i)
his, her or its rights under the Seller Release, this Agreement and any
Ancillary Documents, (ii) claims for indemnity under

 



68  the Target Companies Charter Documents, (iii) any rights under any policy of
insurance carried by the Target Companies, (iv) any rights under the Office
Lease Agreement, dated as of December 9, 2010, by and between Snack Factory,
LLC and Shelbourne Holdings, LLC regarding 11 Tamarack Circle, Units 11 and
13, Skillman, New Jersey 08558, (v) any claim for enforcement of the
Employment Agreements or arising under the terms of the Employment Agreements
after the Closing Date and (vi) any right to payment of any vested accrued
benefits under employee benefit plans.

(c) Each of the Sellers hereby agrees not to, and to not cause the Seller
Related Parties to, directly assert any Release Claim or demand, or file,
commence, institute or cause to be commenced any suit or proceeding of any
kind, against or on behalf of any of the Released Parties, in their corporate
or individual capacities, for any Release Claims released by the Seller
Release.

 _Intellectual Property_

Princeton Vanguard, LLC is currently involved in a matter pending before the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Trademark Trial and Appeals
Board (TTAB), in which Frito-Lay North America, Inc. (Frito-Lay) has filed an
opposition action against the registration of the Companys Pretzel Crisps®
trademark (the Trademark) (Serial No. 76/700,802), on the USPTO Principal
Register (Opposition No. 91195552), and a cancellation action seeking to
cancel the registration of the Trademark (Reg. No. 2,980,303) on the USPTO
Supplemental Register (Cancellation No. 92053001). The Company filed a motion
for summary judgment seeking a dismissal of all Frito-Lays claims as a
matter of law, which motion was fully submitted to the TTAB on July 2, 2012.
The TTAB issued a decision denying the Companys motion on September 5, 2012.
In accordance with the express suggestion provided by the TTAB in its
decision, the parties have agreed to waive their respective rights to a trial
of the dispute and proceed for a binding determination of fact as to the
registrability of the Trademark based upon the current record submitted to
the TTAB in connection with the prior motion practice in the case. The
following filing and briefing schedule has been agreed to between the parties,
and approved by the TTAB:
