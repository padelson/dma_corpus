Inc. (Frito-Lay) has filed an opposition action against the registration of the Company&#146;s Pretzel Crisps&reg; trademark (the Trademark) (Serial No.&nbsp;76/700,802), on the USPTO Principal Register (Opposition No.&nbsp;91195552), and a
cancellation action seeking to cancel the registration of the Trademark (Reg. No.&nbsp;2,980,303) on the USPTO Supplemental Register (Cancellation No.&nbsp;92053001). The Company filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a dismissal of all

TTAB in connection with the prior motion practice in the case. The following filing and briefing schedule has been agreed to between the parties, and approved by the TTAB: </FONT></P>
