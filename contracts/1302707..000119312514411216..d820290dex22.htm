and deliver to Pasha Parent, free and clear of all Liens and Encumbrances, and
Pasha Parent shall purchase from Horizon, one hundred percent (100%) of the

6.7_:

Estimated Purchase Price; and

 



2 (b) following the Closing, (i) Pasha and Horizon shall adjust the Purchase
Price as and to the extent required pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and make any
payments required thereunder; and (ii) Horizon, Pasha and Hawaii LLC shall
continue to perform their respective obligations under the terms of this
Agreement, including without limitation the indemnification obligations in
_Sections 2.6_ , _6.5_ , _6.6_ and _6.16_ and _Article VIII_.

 

Section 1.3 _Closing_.

 

(a) The consummation of the Transactions and the payment of the Estimated
Purchase Price shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") at the
offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York:
(i) on the later of (A) subject to _Section 7.4_, the second (2nd) Business
Day after the first day on which all of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
such time) are satisfied and (B) the date that is thirty (30) days following
the first day on which the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(a)_ and _(b)_
are satisfied or, if applicable, waived; or (ii) on such other date, time or
place as is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the
Closing occurs shall be referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

 

(b) At the Closing:

 

(i) Pasha shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Horizon the following:
(A) by wire transfer (to a bank account designated in writing by Horizon to
Pasha Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) an
amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price in immediately available funds in
United States dollars; and (B) the certificates to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_;

(ii) Horizon shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Pasha (or the
Mortgage Release Escrow Agent, as applicable) the following: (A) certificates
representing the Purchased Interests, together with transfer powers executed
in blank; (B) the certificates to be delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_
and _Section 7.2(b)_; (C) upon Horizons receipt of the Estimated Purchase
Price, a receipt acknowledging payment of the Estimated Purchase Price by
Pasha in full satisfaction of Pashas obligations under _Section
1.3(b)(i)(A)_; (D)(1) duly completed and executed Payoff and Lien Release
Documents (excluding the Payoff and Lien Release Documents described in
Section 6.20(a)(iv _)_ ), in customary form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Pasha; and (2) if required by the Convertible Notes Indenture,
a copy of the opinion of counsel delivered by Horizons counsel to the trustee
pursuant to Section 16.04 of the Convertible Notes Indenture for the release
of Liens and Encumbrances with respect to the Acquired Hawaii Business; and

(iii) each of Pasha and Horizon shall execute and deliver to each other:

(A) An IRS Form 8023 with respect to the purchase of the HSI Shares
in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (" _Form 8023_ ");

 



3 (B) The Sea-Logix Assignment and Assumption Agreement in form and substance as
mutually agreed by the Parties (the " _Sea-Logix Assignment and Assumption
Agreement_ ");

(C) The Hawaii Business Assignment and Assumption Agreement in form and
substance as mutually agreed by the Parties (the " _Hawaii Assignment and
Assumption Agreement_ "); and

 

(D) The Transition Services Agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ ").

(c) No item shall be deemed delivered pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)_ until all
other items to be delivered pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)_ are delivered. If a
party fails to make any delivery required by the terms of _Section 1.3(b)_,
(i) there shall be no obligation for any other party to make any other
delivery required by the terms of _Section 1.3(b)_, (ii) there shall be no
liability for any such other party not making such delivery required by the
terms of _Section 1.3(b)_ and (iii) the Closing shall not be deemed to have
occurred. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Pasha determines not to
pay the Estimated Purchase Price or deliver any items required to be delivered
by Pasha at Closing on the basis of the failure of Horizon to deliver the
documents required to be delivered pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)(ii)(D)_, such
determination shall not constitute a breach by Pasha of its obligations under
this Agreement and shall not entitle Horizon to recover any Losses or seek
specific performance under  _Section 10.9_. The parties further agree that
if Horizon fails to deliver any of the items in Section 1.3(b)(ii)(D), then
the Closing shall be delayed up to ten (10) days until Horizon makes such
deliveries and no Additional Closing Payment Amount shall be payable by Pasha
during such delay (up to ten (10) days). The failure to deliver any of the
documents contemplated by _Section 1.3(b)(ii)(D)_ shall not constitute a
breach by Horizon of its obligations under this Agreement and shall not
entitle Pasha to recover any Losses or seek specific performance under Section
10.9; _provided_ that Horizon has complied with _Section 6.20(a)_.

 

Section 1.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Horizon shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and Horizon shall deliver to Pasha Parent a
statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (i) a good-
faith estimate of (A) Net Working Capital (" _Estimated Net Working Capital_
"), (B) Hawaii Capital Expenditures (" _Estimated Hawaii Capital
Expenditures_ "), (C) Excess Out of Class Defect Cost (the " _Estimated Excess
Out of Class Defect Cost_ "), (D) Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities
(the " _Estimated Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities_ "), and (E)
Paid Non-Ordinary Course Liabilities (the " _Estimated Paid Non-Ordinary
Course Expenses and Liabilities_ "), each determined as of the Closing Date,
based on Horizons books and records and other information available at the
Closing, (ii) the Additional Closing Payment Amount, (iii) an estimate of
Transaction AMT (the " _Estimated Transaction AMT_ ") and (iv) on the
basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price. An
illustrative example of a Preliminary Closing Statement and a calculation of
Net Working Capital, Hawaii Capital Expenditures, Excess Out of Class Defect
Cost, Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities, Paid Non-Ordinary Course
Expenses and Liabilities, Additional Closing Payment Amount, Estimated
Transaction AMT and Estimated

 



4  Purchase Price is set forth as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Sample Statement_ ").
Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Hawaii Capital Expenditures,
Estimated Excess Out of Class Defect Cost, Estimated Non-Ordinary Course
Expenses and Liabilities and Estimated Paid Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and
Liabilities shall be calculated on a basis consistent with _Schedule 1.4(a)_,
the Sample Statement and the Applicable Accounting Principles. Prior to the
Closing, Horizon and Pasha Parent in good faith shall seek to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to the computation of any of the
items in the Preliminary Closing Statement.

 

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Horizon shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Pasha Parent a written statement (the " _Final
Closing Statement_ ") that shall include and set forth a calculation in
reasonable detail of the (i) actual (A) Net Working Capital (" _Closing Net
Working Capital_ "), (B) Hawaii Capital Expenditures (" _Closing Hawaii
Capital Expenditures_ "), (C) Excess Out of Class Defect Cost (" _Closing
Excess Out of Class Defect Cost_ "), (D) Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and
Liabilities (" _Closing Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities_ "), and
(E) Paid Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities (" _Closing Paid Non-
Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities_ "), each determined as of the
Closing Date, as well as (ii) a revised estimate of Transaction AMT, if
applicable (" _Further Estimated Transaction AMT_ "). Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Hawaii Capital Expenditures, Closing Excess Out of Class
Defect Cost, Closing Non-Ordinary Course Liabilities and Closing Paid Non-
Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities shall each be prepared on a basis
consistent with _Schedule 1.4(a)_ , the Applicable Accounting Principles and
the Sample Statement.

 

(c) Subject to further adjustments to the Further Estimated Transaction AMT as
described in Section 6.16, the Final Closing Statement shall become final and
binding on the thirtieth (30th) day following delivery thereof, unless prior
to the end of such period, Pasha Parent delivers to Horizon written notice of
its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying the nature and
amount of any dispute as to Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Hawaii
Capital Expenditures, Closing Excess Out of Class Defect Cost, Further
Estimated Transaction AMT, Closing Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and
Liabilities and/or Closing Paid Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities
as set forth on the Final Closing Statement. Pasha shall be deemed to have
agreed with all items and amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Hawaii Capital Expenditures, Closing Excess Out of Class Defect Cost, Further
Estimated Transaction AMT, Closing Non-Ordinary Course Liabilities and/or
Closing Paid Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities not specifically
referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not
be subject to review in accordance with _Section 1.4(d)_.

 

(d) During the fifteen (15) day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by Pasha Parent to Horizon, the parties in good faith shall seek
to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Hawaii Capital
Expenditures, Closing Excess Out of Class Defect Cost, Closing Non-Ordinary
Course Expenses and Liabilities, Closing Paid Non-Ordinary Course Expenses
and Liabilities and/or Further Estimated Transaction AMT as specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. Any disputed items resolved in writing between Horizon
and Pasha Parent within such fifteen (15) day period shall be final and
binding with respect to such items, and if Horizon and Pasha Parent agree in
writing on the resolution of each disputed item

 



5  specified by Pasha Parent in the Notice of Disagreement and the amount of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Hawaii Capital Expenditures, Closing
Excess Out of Class Defect Cost, Closing Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and
Liabilities, Closing Paid Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities and
Further Estimated Transaction AMT, the amounts so determined shall be final
and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If Horizon and Pasha
Parent have not resolved all such differences by the end of such fifteen (15)
day period, Horizon and Pasha Parent shall submit, in writing, to an
independent public accounting firm (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "),
their briefs detailing their views as to the correct nature and amount of each
item remaining in dispute and the amounts of Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Hawaii Capital Expenditures, Closing Excess Out of Class Defect
Cost, Closing Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities, Closing Paid Non-
Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities and/or Further Estimated Transaction
AMT, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written determination as
to each such disputed item and the amount of Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Hawaii Capital Expenditures, Closing Excess Out of Class Defect Cost,
Closing Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities, Closing Paid Non-
Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities and/or Further Estimated Transaction
AMT. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or,
if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other independent public
accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing by Horizon and Pasha Parent.
Pasha and Horizon shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters
submitted to it within thirty (30) days following the submission thereof (the
date of such decision, the " _Determination Date_ "). The Independent
Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in Pashas and
Horizons respective calculations of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Hawaii Capital Expenditures, Closing Excess Out of Class Defect Cost, Closing
Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities, Closing Paid Non-Ordinary Course
Expenses and Liabilities and/or Further Estimated Transaction AMT that are
identified as being items and amounts to which Pasha and Horizon have been
unable to agree. Except with respect to the calculation of Further Estimated
Transaction AMT, the scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be limited to correcting mathematical errors and
determining whether the items and amounts in dispute were determined in
accordance with _Schedule 1.4(a)_ , the Applicable Accounting Principles and
the Sample Statement and the Independent Accounting Firm is not to make any
other determination, including any determination as to whether Target Net
Working Capital, Target Hawaii Capital Expenditures or any estimates on the
Preliminary Closing Statement are correct, adequate or sufficient. In
resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party. The Independent Accounting Firms determination of Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Hawaii Capital Expenditures, Closing Excess Out of Class
Defect Cost, Closing Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities, Closing
Paid Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities and/or Further Estimated
Transaction AMT shall be based solely on written materials submitted by Pasha
and Horizon ( _i.e._ , not on independent review). The determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review, except with
respect to Transaction AMT as further provided herein. In acting under this
Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will be entitled to the privileges
and immunities of an arbitrator.

 



6 (e) The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to this _Section 1.4_,
including the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by Horizon and Pasha
in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the Affiliates and
Representatives of each party incurred in connection with the preparation or
review of the Final Closing Statement and preparation or review of any Notice
of Disagreement, as applicable, shall be borne by such party.

(f) Each party will afford the other party and its Representatives

Agreement.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, except as expressly provided above, any assets
held by HSI or Sea-Logix at Closing, after giving effect to the

Hawaii Business, any Transferred Assets or the ownership or use of the
Transferred Assets, whenever incurred.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Hawaii Business Balance Sheet Liabilities_
" shall mean (i) liabilities and obligations exclusively arising out of or
relating to the conduct or operation of the Hawaii Business, any Transferred
Assets or the ownership or use of the Transferred Assets, and (ii) with
respect to liabilities and obligations that do not exclusively arise out
of or relate to the conduct or operation of the Hawaii Business, any

Section 2.5 _Further Assurances_.

before and after the Closing Date, in the equitable distribution of the
Contributed Assets, which may include the substitution of specific items or

quantity, quality and value. At the request of Pasha, Horizon shall deliver
any specific Contributed Asset not transferred at Closing to Pasha at Pashas
expense and at the request of Horizon, Pasha shall deliver any specific
Excluded Asset transferred at Closing at Horizons expense. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the apportionment and settlement of owned and leased
containers, chassis, gensets and related equipment shall be completed in a
manner consistent with _Schedule 2.5(a)_.

 

(b) To the extent a Contract relates in part, but not exclusively, to the
Hawaii Business (other than those Contracts that relate to the Hawaii
Business solely due to historical cost allocation in a manner consistent with
_Schedule 1.4(a)_ and the Applicable Accounting Principles) (any such
Contract, a " _Multi-Tradelane Contract_ "), the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts and reasonably cooperate, in accordance with
applicable Laws and regulations, before and after the Closing Date, to cause
any necessary novation, amendment, assignment and/or assumption and equitable
partition of the rights and obligations of the Multi-Tradelane Contract, such
that Pasha and/or Hawaii LLC and the counterparties to such Multi-Tradelane
Contract will enter into and be bound by the terms of a new Contract that
relates exclusively to the Hawaii Business (any such novated, amended,
assigned or assumed Multi-Tradelane Contract or related new Contract entered
into by Pasha and/or Hawaii LLC, an " _Assumed or Novated Multi-Tradelane
Contract_ "). The parties will each bear their own internal and out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining any such novation,
amendment, assignment and/or assumption; _provided_ that Pasha and Hawaii LLC,
on the one hand, and Horizon, on the other hand, shall each bear and pay
fifty percent (50%) of any fees, penalties, concessions or other consideration
that is required to be paid to the counterparties to such Multi-Tradelane
Contract in order to obtain any such novation, amendment, assignment
and/or assumption (" _Novation Fees_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Novation Fees shall not include any payments, service fees, subscription fees,
license fees, contract fees, operating costs, performance bonds, guarantees or
similar arrangements, or any other obligations, payments, fees, expenses or
costs arising from or related to the performance of, the receipt of goods,
services or other benefits under, or the grant of rights under, any Multi-
Tradelane Contract (" _Service Fees_ "). Pasha and Hawaii LLC shall bear and
pay one hundred percent (100%) of any Service Fees relating to any Assumed or
Novated Multi-Tradelane Contract and Horizon shall bear and pay one hundred
percent (100%) of any Service Fees relating to the portion of the Multi-
Tradelane Contract that remains with Horizon after such novation, amendment,
assignment and/or assumption and partition. This _Section 2.5_ shall not
apply to (i) any collective bargaining

 



14  agreement to which Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries is a party pertaining
to the Hawaii Business, which collective bargaining agreements shall be
subject to the provisions set forth in the Step Plan, (ii) any Contract
relating to IT or fixed or general corporate overhead of Horizon and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Entities) that is not a Multi-Tradelane
Contract unless Pasha, HSI, Sea-Logix or Hawaii LLC or their Subsidiaries
will receive benefits or services under such Contract (other than pursuant to
the Transition Services Agreement) after the Closing Date, or (iii) any
insurance Contract or policy, which shall be subject to the provisions
of Section 6. _10_ (e).

Section 2.6 _Consents to Certain Assignments_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the grant, sale,
assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance, novation or delivery or attempted
grant, sale, sublease, assignment, transfer, conveyance, novation or delivery
to Hawaii LLC of any asset (including any Contract) that would be a
Contributed Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any
governmental or third party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers,
and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been
obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall proceed without the grant,
sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance, novation or delivery of
such Contributed Asset _unless_ such failure causes a failure of any of the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ , in which event the Closing
shall proceed only if the failed condition is waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. In the event that there is no failed
condition to Closing, or any failed condition to Closing is waived, and the
Closing proceeds without the grant, transfer, sale, sublease, assignment,
transfer, conveyance, novation or delivery of any such asset, then following
the Closing, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts, and
cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers; _provided_ , that any such cooperation and related
actions by Horizon, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates shall be
considered Transition Services (as defined in the Transition Services
Agreement) and subject to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, and
any related costs and expenses incurred by Horizon, its Subsidiaries or any
of their Affiliates shall be paid by Pasha and Hawaii LLC pursuant to Section
3.1 of the Transition Services Agreement. Pending such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver, the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and
lawful arrangements designed to provide to Hawaii LLC the benefits of use of
such asset and to Horizon the benefits, including any indemnities, that it
would have obtained had the asset been conveyed to Hawaii LLC at Closing. Once
authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the grant, sale, assignment,
sublease, transfer, conveyance, novation or delivery of any such asset not
granted, sold, assigned, subleased, transferred, conveyed, novated or
delivered at the Closing is obtained, Horizon shall or shall cause the
relevant Subsidiary to, assign, transfer, convey and deliver such asset to
Hawaii LLC at no additional cost. To the extent that any such asset cannot be
transferred or the full benefits of use of any such asset cannot be provided
to Hawaii LLC following the Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.6_, then
Hawaii LLC and Horizon, to the extent permitted by applicable law or any
Contract, shall enter into such arrangements (including subleasing,
sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to the parties hereto the economic
(taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent of
obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver and the performance
by Hawaii LLC of the obligations thereunder; _provided_ , that any such
arrangement and related actions by Horizon, its Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates shall be considered Transition Services (as defined in the
Transition Services

 



15  Agreement) and subject to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement,
and any related costs and expenses incurred by Horizon, its Subsidiaries or
any of their Affiliates shall be paid by Pasha and Hawaii LLC pursuant to
Section 3.1 of the Transition Services Agreement. Horizon shall hold in trust
for and pay to Hawaii LLC promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds
and other monies received by Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with Hawaii LLCs use of any such asset and Hawaii LLC shall assume all
liabilities and obligations arising from or relating to any such asset and
shall indemnify (in accordance with Article VIII) Horizon, its Subsidiaries,
and each of their Affiliates and Representatives from and against all Losses
they, or any of them, may incur in connection with Hawaii LLCs use of, or any
liabilities and obligations arising from or relating to, such asset.

 

Section 2.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Schedule 2.7_ sets forth the parties allocation of the Estimated
Purchase Price (and any Transferred Liabilities that are treated as
consideration for the Contributed Assets for federal income Tax purposes),
based on the parties estimate of the components thereof as of the date
hereof, among the Contributed Assets, the assets of Sea-Logix and the HSI
Shares for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as an
allocation of the portion of such amount allocable to the HSI Shares (and any
liabilities of HSI treated as purchase price for federal income Tax purposes)
among the assets of HSI in a manner consistent with Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Purchase
Price Allocation_ "). Within thirty (30) days after the completion of the
Purchase Price adjustment under _Section 1.4(g)_ above, Pasha shall prepare
and deliver to Horizon a schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") allocating
the Purchase Price (and any Transferred Liabilities that are treated as
consideration for the Contributed Assets for federal income Tax purposes)
among the Contributed Assets, the assets of Sea-Logix and the HSI Shares as
well as an allocation of such amount allocable to the HSI Shares (and any
liabilities of HSI treated as purchase price for federal income Tax purposes)
among the assets of HSI, in each case, in a manner consistent with _Schedule
2.7_. Horizon shall have the right to review the Allocation Schedule, and,
within thirty (30) days after its receipt thereof, Horizon shall notify Pasha
in writing of any proposed changes thereto; _provided_ , that, if Horizon does
not provide any written changes within such 30-day period, Horizon shall be
deemed to have agreed to the Allocation Schedule as prepared by Pasha. If the
parties do not resolve all disputed items relating to the Allocation Schedule
within thirty (30) days after Horizons written notification to Pasha
of proposed changes, the parties shall submit all remaining disputed items to
the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution. The Independent Accounting
Firms review shall be limited to the remaining disputed items, and its
determination shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and shall
not be subject to appeal or further review. The costs of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be borne by Horizon and Pasha in the same manner in
which costs are borne by the parties under  _Section 1.4(e)_ above. If the
Purchase Price changes by reason of _Section 1.4_ or _Section 6.16_, Pasha
shall promptly after the completion of such adjustment revise the Allocation
Schedule, and the foregoing time periods and dispute resolution mechanisms
shall apply to such revised Allocation Schedule as if it were the original
Allocation Schedule (the Allocation Schedule, as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 2.7_, the " _Final Allocation Schedule_ ").

 



16 (b) Each party agrees to timely file Internal Revenue Service Forms 8594 and
8883 reflecting the Purchase Price Allocation as set forth in the Final
Allocation Schedule for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date (and,
if applicable, the year in which the final amount of the Purchase Price has
been determined) and to make any timely filing required by other applicable
Tax Laws. The Final Allocation Schedule shall be binding on Horizon and Pasha
for all Tax reporting purposes. Unless otherwise required by a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code (or similar provisions of
state or local Law), neither Horizon nor Pasha shall take any position
inconsistent with the Final Allocation Schedule in connection with any Tax
proceeding, except that Pashas cost for the Contributed Assets, the assets
of Sea-Logix and the HSI Shares may differ from the amount so allocated to the

in the amount realized by Horizon. If any Governmental Authority disputes the
Final Allocation Schedule, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall
promptly notify the other party hereto of such dispute, and the parties hereto
shall cooperate in good faith for purposes of responding to such dispute.

 

(c) Any indemnification payment or other adjustment to Purchase Price (in
addition to those potential adjustments identified in  _Section 2.7(a)_
above) that is treated as an adjustment to Purchase Price for Tax purposes
shall be reflected as an adjustment to the price allocated to a specific
asset, if any, giving rise to such adjustment, or, if such adjustment
does not relate to a specific asset, such adjustment shall be allocated among
the Contributed Assets, the assets of Sea-Logix and the assets of HSI in

the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Hawaii Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) _Section 3.1(b)(1)_ of the Horizon Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true

where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not

Material Adverse Effect. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, each Acquired Entity are owned directly or

been, conducted in compliance in all material respects with all Laws
applicable to the Hawaii Business (other than Environmental Laws, which are

Schedule, Horizon and its Subsidiaries hold, and are in compliance with, all
Hawaii Business Permits (other than those under Environmental Laws, which are

in compliance with any Hawaii Business Permit that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the

24 Section 3.9 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) _Section 3.9(a)(i)_ of the Horizon Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list of all material Horizon Plans (the " _Disclosed
Horizon Plans_ "). _Section 3.9(a)(ii)_ of the Horizon Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a complete and correct list of all Disclosed Horizon Plans
sponsored by an Acquired Entity (" _Acquired Entity Plans_ "). Horizon has
made available to Pasha, to the extent applicable, current, correct and
complete copies of (i) each Disclosed Horizon Plan, (ii) the three most recent
annual reports on Form 5500 required to be filed with the IRS with respect to
each Horizon Plan (if any such report was required), (iii) the most recent
summary plan description for each Horizon Plan for which such summary plan
description is required (together with any summary of material modifications,
if applicable), (iv) each trust agreement and insurance or group annuity
contract relating to any Horizon Plan and (v) with respect to each Acquired
Entity Plan, all material documents and correspondence relating to
the Acquired Entity Plan received from or provided to the U.S. Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the IRS or any other
Governmental Authority during the past three years.

 

(b) Each Horizon Plan has been established, maintained, funded and
administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and
in compliance in form and in operation with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws. There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Horizon, threatened Actions (other than claims for benefits in
the ordinary course) with respect to, or any Liens filed against or with
respect to, any Horizon Plans other than claims made in the ordinary course of
business which are not, individually or in the aggregate, material. All
contributions required to be made by Horizon and its Subsidiaries have been
timely made in compliance with applicable Law with respect to all Horizon
Plans, and there are no material unfunded obligations of Horizon or any of its
Subsidiaries under any Horizon Plan that are not accurately reflected in
Horizons financial statements and accrued in accordance with GAAP.

(c) All Horizon Plans, other than any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) that are "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that are intended to be Tax qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (each, a " _Horizon Pension Plan_ ") have received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS on which Horizon may currently
rely, or has filed a timely application therefor. Horizon has made available
to Pasha a correct and complete copy of the most recent determination letter
received with respect to each Horizon Pension Plan, as well as a correct and
complete copy of each pending application for a determination letter, if any.
To the knowledge of Horizon, no fact exists or Event has occurred since the
date of such letter or letters from the IRS that would reasonably be expected
to result in the loss of the qualified status of any such Horizon Plan or the
exempt status of any such trust.

 

(d) Except as set forth on _Section 3.9(d)_ of the Horizon Disclosure
Schedule, neither Horizon nor any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated, that together with Horizon would be deemed a "single employer"
within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (including any entity that
during the past six (6) years was a Subsidiary of Horizon) (each such entity,
an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has now or at any time within the previous six (6)
years contributed to, sponsored, or maintained a multiemployer plan (as
defined in Section 3(37) of 

 



25  ERISA) or a plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code. Horizon and each ERISA Affiliate have satisfied the minimum
funding standards under Section 412 or Section 430 of the Code or Section 302
or Section 303 of ERISA. Neither Horizon nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred
any withdrawal liability with respect to a complete or partial withdrawal from
any Horizon Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Horizon Plan is a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" as such term is defined in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA.

 

(e) Except as set forth on _Section 3.9(e)_ of the Horizon Disclosure
Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions will not, either alone or in combination with another
Event, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (i) entitle any current
or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Hawaii Business
to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment from Horizon
or any of its Affiliates under any Horizon Plan, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation or otherwise
enhance any benefit due any such employee, officer, director or consultant or
(iii) otherwise trigger any material obligations or penalties under, breach of
or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), any
Horizon Plan, including under any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA). Neither Horizon nor any Subsidiary is in material breach of
or material default under the terms of any Horizon Plan. To the Knowledge of
Horizon, no other party to any Horizon Plan is in material breach of or
material default under the terms of any Horizon Plan.

(f) Neither Horizon nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract,
arrangement or plan (including any Horizon Plan) that has resulted or would
result, separately or in the aggregate, in connection with the Transactions
(either alone or in combination with any other Events), in the payment of any
"excess parachute payments" to any "disqualified individual," in each case
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. There is no Contract, plan or
other arrangement to which Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries is a party

in writing, furnish Horizon with copies of (or, in the case of
oral communications, advise Horizon of the contents of), any communication to
Pasha from a Governmental Authority concerning the Transactions and permit
Horizon to review and discuss in advance (and shall fully consider any
comments made by Horizon in good faith in relation to) any proposed written
communication to a Governmental Authority concerning the Transactions and (ii)
not independently participate in any meeting or discussions with a
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning the Transactions without giving Horizon prior notice of such
meeting or discussions and report to Horizon promptly thereafter. However,
each of Pasha and Horizon may designate any nonpublic information provided
to any Governmental Authority or any meetings or discussions with any
Governmental Authority as restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and
any such information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors
or their equivalents of the other party without approval of the party
providing the nonpublic information.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing and subject to
Pashas rights pursuant to the first sentence of _Section 6.2(e)_, Pasha and
Horizon shall use reasonable best efforts to contest, litigate and resist any
Antitrust Proceedings and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Order that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation
of the Transactions, including reasonably pursuing administrative and judicial
appeal.

 

(e) With respect to the foregoing matters and subject to Horizons
participation and consultation rights under  _Section 6.2(c)_, it is agreed
that Pasha shall have the exclusive right to determine whether and how long to
contest or litigate any Antitrust Proceeding. Pasha shall also determine
strategy for and lead all Antitrust Proceedings, and 

 



46  coordinate all activities to the extent pertaining to Antitrust Clearance,
including, without limitation, in litigating, if applicable, or otherwise
contesting objections to or Antitrust Proceedings challenging the
consummation of the Transactions. Horizon and Pasha agree to cooperate with
each other and to take such actions as are deemed prudent by Pasha in order to
secure needed clearances or consents from any Governmental Authority,
including cooperating with Pasha on any remedy deemed prudent by Pasha for
purposes of obtaining Antitrust Clearance, and, if applicable, to assist Pasha
in litigating or otherwise contesting objections to or Antitrust
Proceedings challenging the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in no event shall Horizon be obligated to take any action with
respect to its businesses, operations, assets or properties that is not
conditioned upon the Closing. Pasha shall make all strategic and tactical
decisions as to the manner in which to contest or respond to all Antitrust
Proceedings; _provided_ , that, subject to applicable Laws and as required by
any Governmental Authority, Pasha shall keep Horizon promptly informed of the
status of any Antitrust Proceedings, including by promptly furnishing Horizon
with copies of all notices or other communications received by Pasha from any
Governmental Authority in connection with any Antitrust Proceedings;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Pasha enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Authority to extend any waiting period under Antitrust
Laws or to delay or not to consummate the Transactions without Horizons
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(f) Horizon shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses it incurs
including the fees and related disbursements of its counsel incurred for
purposes of obtaining Antitrust Clearance and the fees and expenses of its
counsel in connection with any Antitrust Proceedings. Pasha shall be solely
responsible for all other fees and expenses (including any necessary HSR
filing fees and all attorneys fees of Pashas counsel and related
disbursements) incurred in connection with the Parties efforts to obtain
Antitrust Clearance, including those incurred in connection with any
Antitrust Proceedings. Pasha shall determine when and whether to retain any
economist(s) or other expert(s) and shall be solely responsible for any fees
and expenses of such economist(s) or expert(s).

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be deemed to require, Pasha to
agree to or effect any divestiture, hold separate order, or take any similar
action.

Section 6.3 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release of Horizon and
Pasha Parent to be reasonably agreed upon by Horizon and Pasha Parent.
Following such initial press release, Horizon and Pasha shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system (and then only after as much
advance notice and consultation as is feasible); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.3_ shall not apply to any
release or public statement in connection with any dispute between
the parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of any party hereto
to make internal announcements to their respective employees and other
stockholders that are not inconsistent in any material

 



47  respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions.
Neither party shall issue any press release or joint press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement or the Transactions that includes
the name of or any information regarding Matson or the Merger Agreement
without the prior written approval of such press release by Matson.

 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Notification of Certain
Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the date on which this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, Horizon shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford Pasha Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to Horizons and
its Subsidiaries officers, employees, agents, properties, books, financial
statements, forecasts and other financial data, Tax Returns, Contracts,
litigation files and other records to the extent related to or involving the
Hawaii Business and Horizon shall furnish promptly such other documents and
information concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and
properties to the extent related to or involving the Hawaii Business as Pasha
Parent and its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , that
Pasha Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such
a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
Horizon and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, other than with
respect to a customary due diligence investigation by any financing sources or
their Representatives, Horizon and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information if Horizon determines, in its reasonable
judgment after consultation with outside counsel, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third
party, jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege, or expose
such party to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Horizon shall have no obligation to provide access for, and
neither Pasha nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall have the
right to perform, any sampling or analysis of soil, groundwater, building
materials, effluent, indoor air or other environmental media commonly known as
Phase II environmental assessment work. The information provided will be
subject to the terms of the confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of
December 27, 2013, between Pasha Parent and Horizon (as it may be amended from
time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Pasha and Horizon shall not, and Pasha and
Horizon shall cause their respective Representatives not to, use such
information for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions. Pasha further agrees to destroy, promptly, but in no case later
than five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date, all Evaluation
Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and other information
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent that it
does not pertain to the Hawaii Business without keeping any copies, in whole
or part thereof in any medium whatsoever, and, following such destruction,
to cause an authorized officer to deliver to Horizon a certificate stating
that Pasha has complied with the foregoing. No investigation pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ or information provided, made available or delivered to Pasha
Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall modify any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 

(b) Until the Closing, Horizon and Pasha shall promptly notify each other in
writing of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental

 



48  Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions, (ii) any other material notice or
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions, (iii) any Action commenced or, to such partys Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such
party or any of its Subsidiaries which relates to the Transactions, or (iv)
any Event, fact, change, condition, circumstance or occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any Event (A) that (x) with respect to any representation
or warranty that is qualified as to materiality, Hawaii Material Adverse
Effect or Pasha Material Adverse Effect, renders or would reasonably be
expected to render any representation or warranty of such party set forth in
this Agreement (disregarding any materiality qualification contained therein)
to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (y) with respect to any
representation or warranty that is not qualified as to materiality, Hawaii
Material Adverse Effect or Pasha Material Adverse Effect, renders or would
reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty of such party
set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or (B) that results or would reasonably be expected to result in any
failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or Contract (including any condition set forth in _Article
VII_ ) to be complied with or satisfied hereunder; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such notification pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ or information
provided shall modify any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties
hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date, Horizon shall provide Pasha Parent with (x) an updated list setting
forth any and all Hawaii Contracts that, as of the date of such supplement,
would have been required to be set forth on _Section 3.13(a)_ of the Horizon
Disclosure Schedule had the date of this Agreement been the date of such
supplement (any such Contract, " _New Material Hawaii Contract_ "), (y)
updated _Sections 3.2(a)_  and _(b)_ of the Horizon Disclosure Schedule
setting forth such information that, as of the date of such supplement, would
have been required to be set forth on _Sections 3.2(a)_ and _(b)_ of the
Horizon Disclosure Schedule had the date of this Agreement been the date of
such supplement and (z) an updated list setting forth the persons that, as of
the date of such supplement, would have been required to be set forth on Part
I or Part II of _Schedule 6.5(a)_  had the date of this Agreement been the
date of such supplement. Such supplement shall not be deemed to cure any
breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or have any
effect for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.2_ or the compliance by Horizon with any covenant set
forth herein (other than this _Section 6.4_). Each party acknowledges and
agrees that the failure to notify the other party of any breach of a
representation or warranty pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ or, in the case of
Horizon, the failure to provide any disclosure supplement pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_, on its own shall be treated only as a breach of
the applicable representation or warranty for purposes of _Article VII_ and
not a breach of a covenant or obligation in this _Section 6.4(b)_.

 

Section 6.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Closing, Horizon shall cause Hawaii LLC to (i)
become the employer with respect to each Hawaii Employee then actively
performing services as a common-law employee or on a leave of absence
(including, without limitation, vacation or sick leave, but excluding only
those Hawaii Employees who are both (A) not Represented Hawaii Employees (as
defined in  _Section 6.5(f)_) and (B) on short-term disability or long-term
disability (any such employee on short-term or long-term disability leave
shall be referred to as a

 



49  " _Disabled Hawaii Employee_ ")), as of the date of such transfer of
employment (other than Hawaii Employees of Sea-Logix or HSI, who shall remain
employees of Sea-Logix or HSI, respectively), with such employment in the
identical geographic location, and with base pay at least equal to his or her
base rate of pay as in effect with respect to such individual immediately
prior to such transfer of employment to Hawaii LLC and (ii) assume all
obligations and Contracts relating to each Hawaii Employee (other than (A)
Hawaii Employees of Sea-Logix or HSI, whose obligations and Contracts shall
remain with Sea-Logix or HSI, respectively, (B) any collective bargaining
agreement with respect to Represented Hawaii Employees (which collective
bargaining agreements are addressed elsewhere in this Agreement and the Step
Plan) and (C) the Disabled Hawaii Employees, who shall be transferred after
the Closing in accordance with _Section 6.5(b)_) on the same terms as in
effect with respect to such Hawaii Employee immediately prior to such date of
transfer of employment (for those Hawaii Employees whose employment is
transferred) or the Closing Date (for all other Hawaii Employees). Such
employment and/or assumption by Hawaii LLC shall commence upon the Closing,
and shall be deemed for all purposes to have occurred with no interruption or
break in service. " _Hawaii Employees_ " shall mean: (w) any and all
individuals who are, were or prior to the Closing will be (1) a common law
employee or a Represented Employee domiciled in California or Hawaii (which
includes certain employees who may perform services, in whole or in part, for
non-Hawaii tradelanes) or (2) a Represented Employee of MEBA acting as a
shore-side port engineer and domiciled in California, Hawaii or Washington;
(x) any consultant, independent contractor or other service provider who at
any time prior to or as of the Closing Date primarily provides, provided or
will provide services with respect to the Hawaii Business, including any
Acquired Entity and (y) any employee, consultant, independent contractor or
other service provider performing services on board a Hawaii Vessel at any
time prior to or as of the Closing Date. To the Knowledge of Horizon, the
Hawaii Employees (other than Represented Hawaii Employees and Disabled
Hawaii Employees) as of the date hereof are listed on Part I of _Schedule
6.5(a)_ and Disabled Hawaii Employees as of the date hereof are listed on Part
II of _Schedule 6.5(a)._ Such schedules shall be updated by Horizon from time
to time prior to the Closing in accordance with _Section 6.4_, but for
avoidance of doubt, the inclusion or exclusion of an individual from Schedule
6.5(a) Part I or II shall not determine whether or not such individual is a
Hawaii Employee.

 

(b) Each Disabled Hawaii Employee shall continue to remain an employee of
Horizon or one of its Subsidiaries until such time as Horizon, Pasha or
Hawaii LLC has been notified that such Disabled Hawaii Employee has obtained a
medical release authorizing such Disabled Hawaii Employee to return to work.
The retention of such Disabled Hawaii Employees by Horizon, its Subsidiaries
or any of their Affiliates shall be considered Transition Services (as
defined in the Transition Services Agreement) and subject to the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pasha and Hawaii
LLC shall be responsible for, shall pay, and shall indemnify Horizon and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates in accordance with Article VIII from and against,
any and all cost, expenses, liabilities, Losses, salary, benefits, severance
and other amounts associated with any Disabled Hawaii Employee. Pasha Parent
shall cause Pasha Sub and/or Hawaii LLC become the employer with respect to,
and assume the obligations and Contracts relating to, each Disabled Hawaii
Employee on terms that are the same in all material respects to those set
forth in Section 6.5(a) (e.g., with base pay at least equal to his or her base
rate of pay as in effect immediately prior to such Disabled Hawaii Employees
disability) within an administratively reasonable period of time
after Horizon, Pasha or Hawaii LLC has been notified that such Disabled
Hawaii Employee has obtained a medical release authorizing such Disabled
Hawaii Employee to return to work.

 



50 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if,
within one (1) year following the Closing Date, the employment of any Hawaii
Employee is involuntarily terminated by an Acquired Entity, other than for
cause, death or disability, Pasha and Hawaii LLC shall provide such Hawaii
Employee with severance benefits at levels no less favorable than and
pursuant to the terms of Horizons current severance policies or, if more
favorable, then as required by applicable local Law, or as may be required
under the terms of an individual agreement in effect with such Hawaii
Employee on the date of this Agreement as provided in _Section 6.5(e)_.

(d) Following the Closing Date, Horizon shall provide health care
continuation coverage to all Hawaii Employees (other than Represented Hawaii
Employees and Disabled Hawaii Employees) who (i) become eligible to elect such
coverage under Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA or other comparable law ("
_COBRA_ ") and (ii) timely elect such coverage until the first day of the
calendar month following thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. The
provision of such COBRA coverage by Horizon, its Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates shall be considered Transition Services (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) and subject to the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pasha and Hawaii LLC shall
be responsible for, shall pay, and shall indemnify Horizon and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates in accordance with Article VIII from and against,
any and all cost, expenses, liabilities, Losses, salary, benefits, severance
and other amounts associated with such COBRA coverage. Except as set forth in
the first sentence of this subsection (d), Pasha and Hawaii LLC shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to
provide that for all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Pasha and Hawaii LLC
providing benefits to any Hawaii Employee after the Closing (including the
Horizon Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Hawaii Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with Horizon and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Closing, to the same extent as such Hawaii
Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under
any similar Horizon Plan in which such Hawaii Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing, _provided,_  that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Pasha and
Hawaii LLC shall use reasonable best efforts to provide that (i) each Hawaii
Employee shall be eligible to participate as of the first of the month
following thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, without any further waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
replacing comparable coverage under a Horizon Plan in which such Hawaii
Employee participated immediately before the Closing (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Hawaii
Employee, Pasha and Hawaii LLC shall cause all preexisting condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such Hawaii Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans of
Horizon or its Subsidiaries in which such Hawaii Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing. Pasha and Hawaii LLC shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Hawaii Employee
and his

 



51  or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such Hawaii Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Hawaii Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Pasha and its Subsidiaries shall provide group
health coverage consistent with this Section 6.5 to the Hawaii Employees no
later than the first day of the calendar month following thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date.

(e) From and after the Closing, Pasha and its Subsidiaries (including Hawaii
LLC) shall honor all obligations under the Horizon Plans and compensation and
severance arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Closing and set forth on  _Schedule 6.5(e)_ for
the period ending at the Closing and any additional period at or after the
Closing during which such Horizon Plan remains in effect, and each of Pasha
and Hawaii LLC acknowledges and agrees that the Transactions shall be deemed
to constitute a "change in control," "change of control," "corporate
transaction" or similar term under each such Horizon Plan, arrangement or
agreement.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
subject to the terms of the Step Plan, with respect to each Hawaii Employee
who is a Represented Employee (each, a " _Represented Hawaii Employee_ "),
each such applicable collective bargaining agreement shall govern such
Represented Hawaii Employees terms and conditions of employment (including
compensation and benefits) for so long as such collective bargaining agreement
remains in effect in accordance with, or as otherwise required by, applicable
Law. A " _Represented Employee_ " means any employee who is represented by a
labor organization, including those whose terms and conditions of employment
are covered by a collective bargaining agreement to or by which Horizon or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or bound.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) be treated as an amendment to
any Horizon Plan, (ii) obligate Pasha or Hawaii LLC to (A) maintain any
particular Horizon Plan or other benefit plan, program or arrangement or (B)
retain the employment of any particular employee for any specified period of
time or (iii) prevent Pasha or Hawaii LLC from amending or terminating any
Horizon Plan or any other benefit plan, program or arrangement.

 

(h) Horizon shall provide all required notice(s) to each employee of Horizon
and its Subsidiaries that could be entitled to such notice(s) in accordance
with the WARN Act and any similar state Laws related to actions of Horizon and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date or the planned actions of Pasha
after the Closing Date.

 

(i) Horizon shall provide Pasha, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing, with a schedule by individual recipient of any and all payments
to be made under the Company Incentive Plans (as such term is defined in the
Merger Agreement) to the Hawaii Employees based on (i) for the quarterly
bonus, the actual performance for the Horizons then current fiscal quarter
through the Closing Date and pro-rated for the number of days worked in

 



52  the fiscal quarter during which the Closing occurs and (ii) for the full
year bonus (without duplication of the amount payable pursuant to the
preceding clause (i)), the actual performance for Horizons then current
fiscal year through the Closing Date and pro-rated for the number of days
worked in the fiscal year during which the Closing occurs. For avoidance of
doubt, no payments shall be made in connection with or following the Closing
under any Company Incentive Plan for performance based on any period of time
other than the fiscal quarter during which the Closing occurs. All payments
required to be made under the Company Incentive Plans in connection with
this  _Section 6.5(i)_ shall be made as soon as practicable following the
Closing by the Pasha through its payroll processing system.

 

(j) Nothing in this _Section 6.5_ shall create any third-party beneficiary
right in any Person other than the parties to this Agreement, including any
current or former Hawaii Employee, any participant in any Horizon Plan, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right to continued employment with
Horizon, Pasha, Hawaii LLC or any of their respective Affiliates. 

Section 6.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) Horizon will provide to Pasha, and will cause its Subsidiaries to provide,
at Pashas cost and expense as provided in  _Section 6.6(c)_, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide, all
cooperation reasonably requested by Pasha that is customary and necessary in
connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating debt financing relating
to this Agreement and the Transactions (the " _Financing_ ") and causing the
conditions in the definitive agreements contained in any debt commitment
letters relating to the Financing to be satisfied (such
definitive agreements, together with any such debt commitment letters, the "
_Financing Agreements_ "), including using reasonable best efforts in (i)
assisting with the preparation of offering and syndication documents and
materials in connection with the Financing (all such documents and materials,
collectively, the " _Offering Documents_ "), (ii) preparing and furnishing to
Pasha and the Financing Sources as promptly as practicable with customary
financial information regarding Horizon and its Subsidiaries, in each case as
may be reasonably requested by Pasha to assist in preparation of the Offering
Documents (including execution of customary authorization and management
representation letters and the delivery of reports and consents of Horizons
independent auditors), (iii) having Horizon designate a member of senior
management of Horizon to participate in a reasonable number of presentations
(including customary one-on-one meetings), road shows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with ratings agencies in connection
with the Financing and to cooperate with prospective sources of financing to
do their due diligence, (iv) causing Horizons independent auditors to
cooperate with and assist Pasha in preparing any pro forma financial
statements reasonably required by Pasha and to deliver any cold comfort
letters as may be reasonably requested by Pasha, (v) subject to any
contractual agreements in effect, facilitating the pledging of collateral for
the Financing, (vi) assisting Pasha to obtain from Horizons existing lenders
such consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments which may be
reasonably requested by Pasha in connection with the Financing and collateral
arrangements, including customary payoff letters, lien releases, instruments
of termination or discharge, (vii) cooperating with the marketing efforts of
Pasha and the Financing Sources, (viii) providing such corporate resolutions,
certificates and solvency and other documents as may be reasonably requested
by Pasha in connection therewith, (ix) entering into and causing Subsidiaries
to enter 

 



53  into the Financing Agreements (including credit agreements, notes,
guarantees, pledge and security agreements and other documents as may be
reasonably requested by Pasha), (x) obtaining opinions of counsel to Horizon
and its Subsidiaries and using reasonable best efforts to obtain the
assistance of accountants of Horizon to provide consents for the use of their
reports in the materials related to the Financing and (xi) at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing all customary documentation
and other information about Horizon and each of its Subsidiaries as is
reasonably requested by the Financing Sources with respect to "know
your customer" and anti-money laundering and anti-corruption rules and
regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act. Horizon hereby consents to the use
of the Horizons logos in connection with the Financing in a form and manner
mutually agreed with the Horizon; _provided_ , _however_ , that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to
harm or disparage Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Notwithstanding the requirements of _Section 6.6(a)_, (i) Pasha alone
shall be responsible for provision of any post-Closing pro forma financial
information, including cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or
other pro forma adjustments ( _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt,
Horizon shall provide Pasha with financial and other information relating to
Horizon and its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Pasha to allow Pasha to
prepare such pro forma financial information) and any financial projections of
Horizon for and after the Closing, (ii) neither Horizon nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall
be required to enter into any certificate, document, agreement or instrument
which will be effective prior to the Closing, (iii) nothing herein shall
require cooperation contemplated thereby to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of Horizon or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iv) none of Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries will be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in
connection with the Financing prior to the Closing and (v) nothing herein
shall require cooperation or assistance from a Horizon director, officer or
employee to the extent such Horizon director, officer or employee is
reasonably likely to incur any personal financial liability by providing such
cooperation or assistance that will not be repaid or reimbursed in full by the
Pasha.

 

(c) Pasha will promptly, upon request by Horizon, reimburse Horizon for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees but excluding any allocation of
employee time of employees of Horizon or its Subsidiaries and any other fixed
overhead costs and expenses of Horizon and its Subsidiaries) incurred by
Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of
Horizon and its Subsidiaries contemplated by and performed pursuant to
_Section 6.6(a)_. Pasha shall save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Horizon, its Subsidiaries, their successors and assigns and each of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and all Losses
asserted against, sustained, suffered or incurred by any of the foregoing as a
result of, arising out of or relating to the arrangement of the Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this _Section 6.6_) and any
information used in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing indemnity will not, as to Horizon, its Subsidiaries, their
successors and assigns and each of their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, apply to Losses to the extent they arise from (i) any
information relating to Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries provided in writing
by such Person for use in the Financing or (ii) the willful misconduct, bad
faith or

 



54  gross negligence of such Person (" _Financing Losses_ "). If the Closing has
occurred, any claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.6(c)_
shall be made in accordance with and subject to Article VIII (excluding
_Section 8.3(f)_); if the Closing has not occurred or if this Agreement is
terminated, any claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.6(c)_
shall be made in accordance with the procedures and subject to the terms and
conditions in _Section 8.3_, excluding _Section 8.3(f)_).

 

(d) All nonpublic or otherwise confidential information regarding Horizon or
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates obtained by Pasha or
its Representatives pursuant to _Section 6.6(a)_ shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(e) Pasha acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of Financing is not a
condition to Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate
the Transactions irrespective and independently of the availability of the
Financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ and compliance with _Section 1.3(b)_.

 

Section 6.7 _Intercompany Arrangements_. At the Closing, all then outstanding
intercompany receivables, payables, obligations, agreements and contracts
between each Acquired Entity, on the one hand, and Horizon or any of its
Affiliates (other than each such Acquired Entity), on the other hand, (the "
_Intercompany Arrangements_ "), shall be cancelled, released, terminated or
otherwise eliminated, at no cost to Horizon, the Acquired Entities, Pasha or
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and in all cases none of
Horizon, Pasha, the Acquired Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries
and Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation in respect of
any such Intercompany Arrangements; _provided_ that Intercompany Arrangements
shall not include, and nothing in this _Section 6.7_ shall modify any of
the covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities of Pasha Parent, Pasha
Sub, the Acquired Entities or Horizon as set forth in, this Agreement, the
Hawaii Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Sea-Logix Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, or any other Contract or obligation contemplated hereby
or thereby and/or the Transition Services Agreement.

Section 6.8 _Release of Guarantees_. The parties hereto agree to cooperate
and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain on, or as soon as possible
after, the Closing Date the release of Horizon, its Subsidiaries and their
Affiliates that are a party to any guarantees, performance bonds, bid bonds,
letters of credit and other similar Contracts relating to the Hawaii Business,
including those listed in _Schedule 6.8_ (the " _Guarantees_ "). The parties
will each bear their own internal and out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with obtaining any such release; _provided_ that Pasha
and Hawaii LLC, on the one hand, and Horizon, on the other hand, shall each
bear and pay fifty percent (50%) of any fees, penalties, concessions or other
consideration that is required to be paid to the counterparties to such
Guarantees in order to obtain any such release (" _Release Fees_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Release Fees shall not include the cost of any
replacement or substitute guarantee, bond, letter of credit or similar
obligation or arrangement, or any obligations, payments, fees, expenses or
costs arising from or related to the replacement or substitute guarantee,
bond, letter of credit or similar obligation or arrangement (" _Guarantee
Fees_ "), and Pasha and Hawaii LLC shall bear and pay one hundred percent
(100%) of any such Guarantee Fees for any replacement or substitute guarantee,
bond, letter of credit or similar obligation or arrangement relating to the
Hawaii Business.

 



55 Section 6.9 _Use of Names_. Other than as provided in this _Section
6.9_, Horizon is not conveying ownership rights or granting Pasha, Hawaii LLC
or any of their respective Affiliates a license to use any of the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, logos or domain names of Horizon or any of its
Affiliates (including the name "Horizon Lines" or any trade name, trademark,
service mark, logo or domain name incorporating the name "Horizon Lines") and,
after the Closing, neither Pasha nor Hawaii LLC shall use, or permit any its
Affiliates to use, in any manner the names or marks of Horizon or any of its
Affiliates or any word that is similar in sound or appearance to such names or
marks. Horizon shall permit Pasha and Hawaii LLC, and any of their respective
Affiliates, to use any of the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
logos of Horizon or any of its Affiliates (including the name "Horizon Lines"
or any trade name, trademark, service mark, logo or domain name incorporating
the name "Horizon Lines") in any form used immediately prior to the Closing
temporarily (but in no case for longer than five (5) years following the
Closing) until such time as Pasha and Hawaii LLC can eliminate the use of such
trade names, trademarks, service marks and logos from the assets of the
Acquired Entities.

Section 6.10 _Refunds and Remittances; Insurance_.

 

(a) After the Closing, if Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
receive payment of any Hawaii Receivable or any refund or other amount that
is a Contributed Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing to Pasha, the
Acquired Entities or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, Horizon or such Subsidiary or Affiliate, as
the case may be, shall promptly remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such
amounts to Pasha.

(b) After the Closing, if Pasha, any of the Acquired Entities or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates receive any refund or other amount that
is an Excluded Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing to Horizon or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Pasha, such Acquired Entity, such Subsidiary or such Affiliate, as
the case may be, shall promptly remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such
amounts to Horizon.

 

(c) After the Closing, if Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
actually receive any insurance proceeds in respect of an Out of Class Defect,
which proceeds were not taken into account in determining the Closing Excess
Out of Class Defect Cost and which would have, had such proceeds been received
prior to determination of the Closing Excess Out of Class Defect Cost,
reduced the amount of Closing Excess Out of Class Defect Cost, then Horizon
or such Subsidiary or Affiliate, as the case may be, shall promptly remit, or
shall cause to be remitted, to Pasha an amount equal to the amount by which
the Closing Excess Out of Class Defect Cost would have been reduced had such
proceeds been received prior to determination of the Closing Excess Out of
Class Defect Cost.

 

(d) After the Closing, if Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
actually receive any insurance proceeds in respect of any Non-Ordinary Course
Expenses and Liabilities, which proceeds were not taken into account in
determining the Closing Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities and
Closing Retained Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities and which would
have, had such proceeds been received prior to determination of the Closing
Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities and Closing Retained Non-Ordinary

 



56  Course Expenses and Liabilities, reduced the amount of Closing Non-Ordinary
Course Expenses and Liabilities and Closing Retained Non-Ordinary Course
Expenses and Liabilities, then Horizon or such Subsidiary or Affiliate, as
the case may be, shall promptly remit, or shall cause to be remitted, to Pasha
an amount equal (i) the amount by which the Closing Non-Ordinary Course
Expenses and Liabilities would have been reduced had such proceeds been
received prior to determination of the Closing Non-Ordinary Course Expenses
and Liabilities, _minus_ (ii) the amount by which the Closing Retained Non-
Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities would have been reduced had
such proceeds been received prior to determination of the Closing Retained
Non-Ordinary Course Expenses and Liabilities.

(e) On or before the Closing Date, Horizon shall use its reasonable best
efforts to seek from each entity (an " _Insurer_ ") that issued an insurance
policy or agreement listed on the insurance schedule attached to the Step Plan
(" _Horizon Insurance Agreements_ ") a written consent assigning to Pasha,
Pasha Sub, Hawaii LLC and the Four Vessel LLCs (as defined in the Step Plan),
as their interests appear, all of the rights that a named insured would have
under the Horizon Insurance Agreements relating to the Assumed Liabilities,
which consent to assignment shall be effective as of the Closing Date ("
_Written Consent to Assignment_ "). Horizon agrees it will use reasonable best
efforts as set forth in the Step Plan to assist Pasha to seek the delivery of
each such Written Consent to Assignment at least fifteen (15) days prior to
the Closing Date. Any additional premium (including any costs, taxes, fees or
commission associated with such coverage, a " _Premium_ ") charged by any
insurer or underwriter to obtain such Written Consents to Assignment shall be
paid by Pasha. No Written Consent to Assignment shall have any effect on,
limit or reduce the coverage that Horizon and/or its Subsidiaries have under
any Horizon Insurance Agreement relating to liabilities that are not Assumed
Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the refusal by any
Insurer to provide any Written Consent to Assignment contemplated by this
_Section 6.10(e)_ be deemed a breach by Horizon of its obligations under this
_Section 6.10(e)_.

(f) Except as expressly stated in this _subparagraph (f)_ , after the
Closing, Horizon and/or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Pasha, Pasha
Sub and Hawaii LLC, on the other hand, shall each pay or bear any retention or
deductible specifically related to any claim or action each makes that is
covered under a Horizon Insurance Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, Horizon and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Pasha, Pasha Sub
and Hawaii LLC, on the other hand, shall share, in the ratio of sixty-six and
two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) and thirty-three and one-third per cent (33
1/3%), respectively, (the " _Sharing Ratio_ ") the following: (1) any
aggregate retention or deductible (in excess of the event deductible
applicable to each claim for coverage made under such Horizon Insurance
Agreement) (" _AAD Amount_ ") ;and (2) the amount of any final judgment,
order, or decree against any such entity or settlement by such entity
in excess of the aggregate policy limits that would otherwise have been
covered and paid under a Horizon Insurance Agreement (" _EPL Amount_ ").
Within 10 days after the end of each quarter after the Closing Date during
which Horizon, any Horizon Subsidiary, Pasha, Pasha Sub and/or Hawaii LLC has
paid an AAD Amount or an EPL Amount, such entity shall submit to Aon ("
_Broker_ ") the information and supporting documentation to enable the Broker
to validate each AAD Amount and EPL Amount paid and to allow the Broker to
calculate any amount owed by Horizon and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and Pasha, Pasha Sub and Hawaii LLC, on the other hand, to the other in order
to apply the Sharing Ratio. The Broker shall determine the net amount owing
by Horizon and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and

 



57  Pasha, Pasha Sub and Hawaii LLC, on the other hand, to the other within
fifteen (15) days based on the information provided by the 10th day after the
end of the quarter. The net amount owing shall be paid within ten (10) days.

(g) After the Closing Date, Horizon and each of Pasha, Pasha Sub and Hawaii
LLC agree that (i) any release call and any supplementary call shall be
allocated to the vessel to which such call is associated and payment of such
call shall be the obligation of the party owning such vessel, and (ii) any
Premium adjustment or audit that results in additional Premium on any Horizon
Insurance Agreement (including any costs, taxes, fees or commission associated
with such Horizon Insurance Agreement) for any period prior to the Closing
Date shall be allocated between Horizon, on the one hand, and Pasha, Pasha
Sub and Hawaii LLC, on the other hand, in the same proportion to the Hawaii
Business as the basis on which the Premium is calculated.

 

(h) Within fifteen (15) days after the first date upon which the respective
obligations of each party to this Agreement to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein are satisfied (or waived in writing by Pasha and Horizon,
if permissible under applicable Law), Horizon shall use its reasonable best
efforts to purchase extended reporting policies for any and all claims
made Horizon Insurance Agreements that shall commence on the Closing Date,
provide for a six (6) year reporting period and have terms and coverage limits
substantially the same as the Horizon Insurance Agreements; provided that
Horizon shall have no obligation to purchase such extended reporting policies
unless Matson and, if applicable pursuant to the next sentence, Pasha, shall
have provided sufficient funds for the purchase of such policies to the
Broker. To the extent that any of Pasha, Pasha Sub, Hawaii LLC and the Four
Vessel LLCs are named on the extended reporting policies as a named insured as
of Closing, the Premiums for the foregoing extended reporting policies shall
be paid thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) by Pasha, Pasha Sub and
Hawaii LLC and sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) by Horizon (provided
that Matson shall fund Horizons payment obligation). The retention or
deductible for the foregoing coverage shall be shared between Horizon and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Pasha, Pasha Sub and Hawaii LLC, on the
other hand, in the manner described in _subparagraph _(f).

 

Section 6.11 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Each of Pasha and Hawaii LLC hereby waives
compliance by Horizon with the provisions of any so-called "bulk transfer
laws" of any jurisdiction in connection with the contribution and subsequent
sale of the Transferred Assets to Pasha and Hawaii LLC.

 

Section 6.12 _Sea-Logix Assignment and Assumption_. Prior to the Closing,
Horizon shall transfer out of Sea-Logix in accordance with the terms of the
Sea-Logix Assignment and Assumption Agreement (a) those employees of Sea-Logix
listed in _Schedule 6.12(a)_ , if any (such employees, the " _Transferred Sea-
Logix Employees_ "), (b) the assets of Sea-Logix listed on _Schedule 6.12(b)_
, if any (such assets, the " _Transferred Sea-Logix Assets_ "), and (c) the
liabilities and obligations of Sea-Logix listed in _Schedule 6.12(c)_ , if any
(such liabilities and obligations, the " _Transferred Sea-Logix Liabilities_
").

Section 6.13 _Hawaii Assignment and Assumption_. At the Closing, Horizon and
certain of its Subsidiaries and Hawaii LLC shall enter into, execute and
deliver the Hawaii Assignment and Assumption Agreement.

 



58 Section 6.14 _Transition Services Agreement_. At the Closing, Horizon, Pasha
and Hawaii LLC shall enter into, execute and deliver the Transition Services
Agreement, pursuant to which Horizon shall provide certain transition services
to Pasha and Hawaii LLC.

 

Section 6.15 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. At the written request
of Pasha (which request shall be delivered at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date), Horizon shall cause any so requested officer and
member of the boards of directors or other governing body of each of the
Acquired Entities to tender his or her resignation from such
position effective immediately prior to the Closing Date and in the event any
such individual does not tender his or her resignation, Horizon shall take
such actions necessary to remove such individuals from such positions.

 

Section 6.16 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Horizon and Pasha agree that, if the
Closing occurs, they shall promptly (and in no event after the due date
thereof) cause the Form 8023 to be filed, reflecting an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and comparable elections under state or local law, if
applicable) (" _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") with respect to the sale and
purchase of the stock of HSI. Horizon and Pasha shall also file the
accompanying Form 8883 in a manner consistent with _Section 2.7_.

 

(b) _Tax Treatment of Purchase of Hawaii LLC Units and Sea-Logix Units_. The
parties agree that, for applicable Income Tax purposes, the purchase of the
Hawaii LLC Units and the Sea-Logix Units shall be treated by Pasha as the
purchase of the assets owned at Closing by Hawaii LLC and Sea-Logix,
respectively, and by Horizon and/or its Affiliates, as applicable, either as
a sale of assets (in the case of Sea-Logix) or as a sale of assets or
interests in an entity treated as a partnership for applicable Income Tax
purposes (in the case of Hawaii LLC).

 

(c) _Indemnity for Taxes_.

 

(i) From and after the Closing, Horizon shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify Pasha and its Affiliates against and hold them harmless on an
after-Tax basis from, all Losses arising from Pre-Closing Income Taxes, fifty
percent (50%) of any Transfer Taxes, and any Taxes incurred by Pasha or any of
its Affiliates after the Closing as a result of a breach by Horizon or any
Affiliate of Horizon after the Closing of any covenant herein relating to
Taxes.

(ii) From and after the Closing, Pasha shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify Horizon and its Affiliates against and hold them harmless on an
after-Tax basis from, all Losses arising from any Transaction AMT, fifty
percent (50%) of any Transfer Taxes, any Excluded Transfer Taxes, any Taxes
of any Acquired Entity or with respect to the Contributed Assets or the
Acquired Hawaii Business (other than any Pre-Closing Income Taxes and any
Taxes incurred by Pasha or any of its Affiliates after the Closing as a result
of a breach by Horizon or any Affiliate of Horizon after the Closing of any
covenant herein relating to Taxes), and any Taxes incurred by Horizon or any
of its Affiliates after the Closing as a result of a breach by Pasha or any
Affiliate of Pasha after the Closing of any covenant herein relating to
Taxes.

 



59 (iii) The party liable for payments pursuant to this _Section 6.16(c)_ shall
pay to the party entitled to the payment, as applicable, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, any such payment required to be made under this
_Section 6.16(c)_ within ten (10) days after the party entitled to
such payment makes demand therefor, but in no case earlier than five (5)
Business Days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be
paid to a Governmental Authority (including as estimated Tax payments).

 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Pasha and Horizon shall each be responsible for fifty
percent (50%) of all Transfer Taxes and Pasha shall be responsible for any
Excluded Transfer Taxes, and the parties shall reasonably cooperate to take
all commercially reasonable steps to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes and
Excluded Transfer Taxes required to be paid. Other than any determination as
to whether a particular Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes or Excluded
Transfer Taxes is required to be filed under applicable Law, which
determination, if disputed, shall be made by the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to  _Section 6.16(l)_, Pasha shall (i) prepare all Tax Returns
required to be filed with respect to Transfer Taxes and Excluded Transfer
Taxes, (ii) deliver a draft of each such Tax Return to Horizon at least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, and (iii)
consider in good faith any comments submitted by Horizon to Pasha in writing
at least fifteen (15) days before such due date and promptly finalize such Tax
Return. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Pasha shall file any Tax
Return required to be filed with respect to Transfer Taxes or Excluded
Transfer Taxes. The non-filing party shall pay its allocable share of the
applicable Transfer Tax or Excluded Transfer Tax liability to the filing
party at least three (3) days before the due date for filing the applicable
Tax Return, and shall join, or, if applicable, shall cause its Affiliate to
join, in the execution of the applicable Tax Return. Promptly following any
filing in respect of Transfer Taxes or Excluded Transfer Taxes, the filing
party shall furnish the other party with a copy of such filing and a copy of a
receipt showing payment of any applicable Transfer Taxes or Excluded Transfer
Taxes.

(e) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) _Income Tax Returns_. Horizon shall prepare and timely file, or cause to
be prepared and timely filed, in accordance with applicable Laws and, where
applicable, past practice all Tax Returns with respect to Income Taxes that
are required to be filed with respect to any Acquired Entity for any taxable
period ending on or before(or including) the Closing Date, including the
consolidated federal and combined or unitary state Tax Returns of Horizon and
its Subsidiaries for the taxable year ending on the closing date of the merger
under the Merger Agreement which shall reflect any revisions to
the calculation of Transaction AMT since the determination of the Further
Estimated Transaction AMT. Any Tax Return with respect to Income Taxes for a
Straddle Period shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be filed on
the basis that the relevant taxable period ended as of the close of business
on the Closing Date.

(ii) _Closing Statement Returns_. Pasha shall prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, in accordance with applicable Laws and,
where applicable, past practice, all Closing Statement Returns.

 



60 (iii) _Applicable Tax Return Review Procedures_. The party required
to prepare a Tax Return described in clause (i) or (ii) above (the "
_Preparing Party_ ") shall deliver to the other party (Pasha or Horizon,
respectively) (the " _Receiving Party_ ") a copy of such Tax Return (or, in
the case of a Tax Return (other than a Tax Return that reports Transaction
AMT) filed on an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary basis, a pro
forma return limited to the relevant Acquired Entity) at least forty-five (45)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (after giving effect to
any applicable extensions); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Preparing Party
shall not be required to submit a copy of a Tax Return to the Receiving Party
(and the Receiving Party shall have no right to review or comment on such Tax
Return) if neither the Receiving Party nor any of its Affiliates is required
to sign such Tax Return or has any liability for (or right to any refund of)
the Tax that is the subject of such Tax Return (whether under this Agreement,
applicable Law or otherwise). The Receiving Party shall have the right to
review the Tax Return provided by the Preparing Party, and, within fifteen
(15) days after its receipt thereof, the Receiving Party shall notify the
Preparing Party in writing of any proposed changes thereto; _provided_ , that,
if the Receiving Party does not provide any written changes within such
fifteen (15)-day period, the Receiving Party shall (without prejudice to its
other rights in this Agreement, including its rights under _Section 6.16(c)_)
be deemed to have agreed to the Tax Return originally provided by the
Preparing Party. If the parties do not resolve all disputed items relating to
such Tax Return within fifteen (15) days after such Tax Return was provided
to the Receiving Party, _Section 6.16(l)_ shall apply. To the extent the
Receiving Party or an Affiliate thereof is required to sign and/or file any
Tax Return subject to this _Section 6.16(e)_, it shall do so promptly upon
such Tax Return becoming final in accordance with this _Section 6.16_. To the
extent the party not filing the applicable Tax Return is liable for any Tax
reflected on such Tax Return, such party shall pay its share (if any) of the
applicable Tax liability reflected in any such Tax Return under _Section
6.16(c)_ to the other party at least three (3) days before the due date for
such Taxes (without prejudice to the paying partys other rights in this
Agreement, including its rights under _Section 6.16(c)_). For the avoidance
of doubt, in the case of a Tax Return that reflects the calculation of
Transaction AMT as determined upon or following the filing of the Tax Return
for the taxable year including the Closing Date and any audit with respect
thereto is different from the Transaction AMT as most recently determined, the
parties shall make a payment to each other in order for the net amount of
Transaction AMT paid by Pasha (taking into account Estimated Transaction AMT,
Further Estimated Transaction AMT and any adjustments with respect thereto) to
equal the Transaction AMT as so determined.

 

(iv) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the time between the end
of the applicable Tax period to which a Tax Return subject to this _Section
6.16(e)(iii)_ relates and the due date thereof is less than sixty (60) days,
then (A) in lieu of the forty-five (45)-day period referred to in clause (iii)
above, the parties shall use a number of days equal to 2/3 of the number of
days between the end of the applicable Tax period and the date the Tax Return
is due (without regard to available extensions), rounded to the nearest whole
number, and (B) in lieu of the fifteen (15)-day period referred to in clause
(iii) above, the parties shall use a number of days equal to 2/3 of the number
of days in the period referred to in clause (A), rounded to the nearest whole
number.

 



61 (f) _Tax Contests_. If any party receives notice of any audit, examination or
other Tax proceeding from a Governmental Authority involving a Tax for which
another party may have liability under applicable Laws or hereunder (a " _Tax
Claim_ "), the party receiving such notice shall promptly notify the other
parties of such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
prompt notice of a Tax Claim shall relieve the party entitled to receive such
prompt notice hereunder from its indemnity obligations under this _Section
6.16_ only if, and only to the extent that, such failure shall have actually
prejudiced such party with respect to such Tax Claim. The party responsible
under this Agreement for the Tax to which such Tax Claim relates (and Horizon
in the case of a Tax Claim that could affect the amount of Transaction AMT)
shall control all proceedings with respect to such Tax Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the other party and counsel or other advisors of its own
choosing shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects of the
prosecution, defense and settlement of such Tax Claim if such party has a good
faith basis to conclude that it or an Affiliate thereof faces a realistic
possibility of liability (determined without regard to its indemnity rights
under this Agreement) with respect thereto or that such Tax Claim could affect
the amount of any refund of Taxes to which such party or an Affiliate of such
party may be entitled, and (ii) the controlling party shall not settle any
such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other party to the
extent such settlement could adversely affect such other party or an Affiliate
thereof, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. 

(g) _FIRPTA Affidavit_. On or prior to the Closing Date, each of Horizon and
any Affiliate of Horizon that is treated as a transferor for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes shall deliver to Pasha a certificate of non-foreign status
(in a form reasonably acceptable to Pasha) pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1445-2(b)(2).

 

(h) _Tax Cooperation_. Horizon and Pasha agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to any Acquired Entity or the Acquired
Hawaii Business (including access to Tax Returns and other books and records)
as is reasonably necessary in connection with any Tax matter relating to
any Acquired Entity or the Acquired Hawaii Business, including the filing of
any Tax Return, the making of any election relating to Taxes (unless
prohibited under this Agreement), the preparation for any audit by any
Governmental Authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax, in each case, relating to any Acquired Entity
or the Acquired Hawaii Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Horizon shall not be required to disclose any
Tax Return relating to Income Taxes of Matson and its Subsidiaries (other than
any such Tax Return (or the portion thereof) of Horizon and/or any of its
Subsidiaries to the extent related solely to the Acquired Hawaii Business or
the reporting of Transaction AMT).

(i) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. On the Closing Date, all Tax
allocation, sharing, indemnity or other similar agreements, arrangements,
understandings or practices between (i) any Acquired Entity, on the one hand,
and (ii) Horizon or any of its Affiliates (other than any Acquired Entity), on
the other hand, shall be terminated effective as of the close of business on
the Closing Date and shall have no further effect for any taxable period.
Horizon shall take all steps necessary to ensure that each such termination is
effective in the manner described above.

 



62 (j) _Refunds_. Any Tax refund and any interest actually received from a
Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes for which Horizon is responsible
under _Section 6.16(c)(i)_ that is received by Pasha or an Affiliate thereof,
and credits in lieu of a cash Tax refund of such Income Taxes, shall be for
the account of Horizon. Any Tax refund and any interest actually received
from a Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes for which Pasha is
responsible under _Section 6.16(c)(ii)_ that is received by Horizon or an
Affiliate thereof, and credits in lieu of a cash Tax refund of such Taxes,
shall be for the account of Pasha. The party receiving and required to pay
over such refund (the " _Refund Paying Party_ ") or credit shall pay over to
the party entitled thereto (the " _Refund Receiving Party_ ") any such refund
and any interest actually received from the relevant Governmental Authority or
the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or
entitlement thereto, net of (i) any reasonable costs associated with
obtaining such refund, and (ii) any Taxes incurred in respect of the receipt
of such refund or credit by the Refund Paying Party and payment of such refund
or credit to the Refund Receiving Party (except that, in the case of a
credit, such amount shall be paid when such credit actually reduces the amount
of any Tax otherwise required to be paid). If, subsequent to a Governmental
Authoritys allowance of a refund or credit, such Governmental Authority
reduces or eliminates such refund or credit, such refund or credit (or the
relevant portion thereof), plus any interest received thereon, previously
forwarded to the Refund Receiving Party under this  _Section 6.16(j)_ shall
be returned to Refund Paying Party within five (5) Business Days of the date
on which the Refund Paying Party is informed of such reduction or elimination.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
refunds and credits of Taxes attributable to a reduction in the amount of the
alternative minimum Tax liability (calculated at the rate imposed under
Section 55 of the Code, plus any applicable state and local
alternative minimum Tax rate) payable by Horizon and its Affiliates
(including HSI with respect to the period ending on the closing date of the
merger under the Merger Agreement) with respect to the Transactions shall be
split equally by Horizon and Pasha, and Horizon shall pay to Pasha any such
amounts owing to Pasha in a manner consistent with the provisions of this
_Section 6.16(j)_. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) none of Horizon or any of
its Affiliates shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of Taxes of any
Acquired Entity or with respect to the Contributed Assets or the Acquired
Hawaii Business, unless such Taxes were Pre-Closing Income Taxes or were paid
by Horizon or any of its Affiliates following the Closing Date and
not otherwise reimbursed by Pasha or any of its Affiliates and (y) none of
Pasha or any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of
Pre-Closing Income Taxes, unless such Taxes were paid by Pasha or any of its
Affiliates following the Closing Date and not otherwise reimbursed by Horizon
or any of its Affiliates.

(k) _Indemnification Payments; Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this _Section 6.16_ or _Article
VIII_ , and any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.4,
shall be treated as adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

(l) _Third Party Resolution of Certain Tax Disputes_. If pursuant to 
_Section 6.16(e)_ or _Section 6.16(m)_ a dispute with respect to a Tax
Return is to be resolved pursuant to this _Section 6.16(l)_, the dispute
shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm using
procedures similar to those set forth in _Section 1.4(d)_, provided that the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accounting Firm to resolve any such dispute in time to file the applicable Tax
Return on a timely basis. If, during the process of

 



63  resolving a dispute concerning a Tax Return such Tax Return becomes due
(taking into account valid extensions, which shall be obtained if available),
then the party required by applicable Law to file such Tax Return (if the Tax
Return becomes due, taking into account extensions of time to file, which
shall be obtained if available) may file such Tax Return or cause such Tax
Return to be filed reflecting any changes that were agreed upon prior to
filing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if as a result of the resolution of the
dispute, the Independent Accounting Firm determines that such Tax Return
should have been prepared differently, an amended Tax Return shall be
prepared and filed accordingly. Nothing herein shall limit a partys right to
indemnification under _Section 6.16(c)_ with respect to any Tax Return that
is the subject of this _Section 6.16(l)_. This _Section 6.16(l)_ shall also
apply to any dispute concerning whether the Preparing Party is required to
file a particular Tax Return, with equitable adjustments to the time periods
to reflect the facts surrounding the dispute; _provided_ that, with the
exception of such determination, a Tax Return with respect to Transfer Taxes
or Excluded Transfer Taxes shall be governed exclusively by _Section 6.16(d)_
above.

 

(m) _Amended Tax Returns_. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law,
none of Horizon or any of its Affiliates shall file an amended Tax Return
with respect to Income Taxes of Horizon and its Subsidiaries for a taxable
period ending on or before, or including, the Closing Date and the closing
date of the merger under the Merger Agreement without Pashas prior
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any dispute regarding the content of such Tax
Return and/or whether any such amended Tax Return is required to be filed
under applicable Law shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to _Section 6.16(l)_. Except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, none of Pasha or any of its Affiliates shall file an amended Tax Return
with respect to Income Taxes of any Acquired Entity for a taxable period
ending on or before, or including, the Closing Date and the closing date of
the merger under the Merger Agreement without Horizons prior written consent,
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any dispute regarding the content of such Tax Return and/or
whether any such amended Tax Return is required to be filed under applicable
Law shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section
6.16(l)_.

(n) _Survival_. The obligations of the parties set forth in this _Section
6.16_ shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect
until sixty (60) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitation (including any extensions thereof) for the assessment or collection
of Taxes for which indemnification may be claimed under this _Section 6.16_.

Section 6.17 _Other Transactions_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof and until the earlier of the Closing Date
or the termination of this Agreement, Horizon shall not, and shall cause each
of the Acquired Entities and its and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates
and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) discuss, encourage,
negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into,
whether as the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired corporation
or otherwise, any transaction involving a merger, consolidation, business
combination, purchase or disposition of any of the Hawaii Business (or any
portion thereof), including the properties or assets of the Hawaii Business,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an

 



64  " _Acquisition Transaction_ "), (ii) facilitate, encourage, solicit or
initiate discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished
to any Person any information concerning the business, operations, properties
or assets of the Hawaii Business in connection with an Acquisition Transaction
or (iv) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or
seek any of the foregoing. From and after the date hereof and until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, if Horizon
or any of the Acquired Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates or Representatives shall receive any proposal with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction, Horizon shall promptly (but in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours) communicate to Pasha the existence of any such
proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Horizon,
the Acquired Entities and its and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates
and Representatives shall be permitted to take any actions otherwise
prohibited or limited by this _Section 6.17(a)_ with respect to any
Alternative Proposal (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) if and
solely to the extent such actions are taken in furtherance of permitted
activities under _Section 5.3_ of the Merger Agreement with respect to such
Alternative Proposal.

 

(b) Horizon shall, and shall cause each of the Acquired Entities and its and
their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives to, cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than Pasha) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction. Subject to the last sentence of _Section 6.17(a)_,
Horizon agrees, and shall cause each of the Acquired Entities and their
respective Subsidiaries to agree, not to release any third party from the
confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which such party
or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party in connection with an
Acquisition Transaction.

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.17_ shall be deemed to prevent or
restrict the ability of Horizon to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change (as defined in the Merger Agreement) in response to a Superior Proposal
(as defined in the Merger Agreement) and/or terminate the Merger
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ thereof subject, in each case, to
Horizons payment of the Termination Fee to Pasha pursuant to _Section 9.4_
hereof to the extent required thereby.

 

Section 6.18 _Sales and Transfer Agreement_. On or prior to Closing, Horizon
shall, and shall cause Hawaii LLC to, enter into written agreements that
comply with and satisfy the "Sales and Transfer" provisions of each collective
bargaining agreement applicable to the Hawaii Business, which agreements shall
commit Hawaii LLC to (a) employ the full complement of union employees
currently employed on any sold or transferred vessel or operations, and
terminate employees only for just cause, (b) provide employees with wages and
benefits at least equal to those they received from Horizon or (c) agree to
arbitrate disputes, including any arising from the written agreement.

Section 6.19 _Hawaii Vessel Inspection_. Within thirty (30) days prior to the
Closing, Horizon shall give Pasha the option, at Pashas cost and expense, to
arrange for an inspection of any or each of the Hawaii Vessels, including a
review of each of the Hawaii Vessels log books and maintenance records and
an underwater inspection of any or each of the Hawaii Vessels by a diver
approved by the Classification Society. Horizon shall make the Hawaii Vessels
available

 



65  for such inspection when next in port in accordance with each such vessels
normal port schedule, which inspection shall be carried out in the presence of
the Classification Society surveyor arranged for by Horizon and paid for by
Pasha; _provided_ , that Horizon shall have the right to refuse a particular
inspection of a Hawaii Vessel if such inspection would reasonably be expected
to delay the on-time schedule of the Hawaii Vessel. If any defect or damage
is found on a Hawaii Vessel that results in an "Outstanding Recommendation of
Class" that requires immediate repair in order for such Hawaii Vessel to
continue to trade (an " _Out of Class Defect_ "), then such Out of Class
Defect shall be repaired by Horizon, at its cost and expense, to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Classification Society.

 

Section 6.20 _Payoff and Lien Release Documents_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Horizon shall use reasonable best efforts to
negotiate and seek to obtain the following payoff and lien release documents
(such documents, collectively, " _Payoff and Lien Release Documents_ ") (it
being understood that Pasha and its Representatives shall be afforded the
opportunity to review and comment on the Payoff and Lien Release Documents): 

(i) Mortgage Release Documents in recordable form and appropriate
documentation releasing all Liens and Encumbrances on the Hawaii Vessels
other than unrecorded Permitted Maritime Liens;

(ii) payoff and termination agreement or lien release agreement (in each
case, in customary form and substance) from the lenders or their respective
representatives with respect to each of the Horizon Credit Facilities,
providing for either (x) the release of any Liens and Encumbrances on
the Acquired Hawaii Business securing such Horizon Credit Facility and the
release and termination of the obligations of any Acquired Entities under
their respective guaranties and security documents supporting the repayment of
such Horizon Credit Facility, in each case upon consummation of the sale of
the Acquired Hawaii Business, or (y) the Payoff Amount for such Horizon Credit
Facility, and the termination of such Horizon Credit Facility (except for
obligations that by the terms of such Horizon Credit Facility survive such
termination), the release of all Liens and Encumbrances securing such Horizon
Credit Facility, and the termination and release of the obligations of any
Subsidiaries of Horizon under their respective guaranties and security
documents supporting the repayment of such Horizon Credit Facility, in each
case upon the receipt of Payoff Amount;

 

(iii) lien release agreements (in each case, in customary form and substance)
from the trustee or other representatives of the holders of the Notes, in
each case providing for either (x) the release of any Liens and Encumbrances
on the Acquired Hawaii Business securing the applicable Notes and the release
and termination of the obligations of any Acquired Entities under their
respective guaranties and security documents supporting the repayment of such
Notes, in each case upon consummation of the sale of the Acquired Hawaii
Business, or (y) the release of the Liens and Encumbrances securing
the applicable Notes and the release and termination of the obligations of
any Subsidiaries of Horizon under their respective guaranties and security
documents supporting the repayment of such Notes, in each case upon receipt of
payment in full of all debt and other obligations due and owing or accrued
under such Notes;

 



66 (iv) appropriate documentation releasing any and all other Liens and
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Liens and Permitted Encumbrances) on the
Transferred Assets, the Acquired Entities and the Purchased Interests (other
than the Hawaii Vessels); and

 

(v) termination amendments with respect to any financing statements filed in
connection with such Secured Indebtedness with respect to the Transferred
Assets, the Acquired Entities and the Purchased Interests, in each case in
customary form and substance.

(b) With respect to the Horizon Credit Facilities that are to be terminated
in connection with the Closing, Horizon shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices and take
all other reasonably necessary actions to facilitate the termination of
commitments and the repayment of all outstanding obligations under such
Horizon Credit Facility and the release of all Liens and Encumbrances securing
the same on the Acquired Hawaii Business; _provided_  that in no event shall
Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries be required to cause such termination or
release unless the Closing shall occur concurrently therewith and Horizon or
its Subsidiaries have received funds from Matson and Pasha to pay in full the
Payoff Amount. On the Closing Date, Horizon shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, upon receipt from Matson and Pasha of funds to pay in full
the Payoff Amount, apply such amounts to the payment of the Horizon Credit
Facilities in accordance with the terms of the payoff letters referred to in
_Section 6.20(a)(ii)(y)_ above.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Horizon and Pasha shall engage Marine
Documentation, Inc. or a similar service company as escrow agent for the
purpose of facilitating the filing and recordation of Mortgage Release
Documents, other appropriate documentation releasing any recorded Permitted
Maritime Liens and any and all Hawaii Vessel title transfer documentation
(such service company, the " _Mortgage Release Escrow Agent_ "). Horizon and
Pasha will use reasonable best efforts to cause the trustees, administrative
agents, collateral agents and any other lienholders (as applicable) for the
Secured Indebtedness and any recorded Permitted Maritime Liens to enter into
escrow arrangements with the Mortgage Release Escrow Agent prior to the
Closing so that the Mortgage Release Documents and documentation releasing
any recorded Permitted Maritime Liens, as applicable, may be placed in escrow
with the Mortgage Release Escrow Agent at or prior to the Closing.

 

Section 6.21 _Treatment of Existing Notes_. As part of the Transactions and
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Horizon shall call for
the redemption of all outstanding First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes on
the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of the applicable Note Documents. In
anticipation thereof, Horizon shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices and take all other reasonably
necessary actions to facilitate the redemption, defeasance or payoff of all
First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes, the payment of all outstanding and
unpaid principal, interest, premiums, penalties, attorneys fees and other
costs and expenses owed under the applicable Note Documents (collectively, the
" _Notes Payoff Amount_ "), and the release of all Liens and

 



67  Encumbrances on the Acquired Hawaii Business securing such Notes, in each
case to occur on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that in no event shall Horizon
or any of its Subsidiaries be required to cause such redemption, defeasance
and payment or release unless the Closing shall occur concurrently therewith
and Horizon or its Subsidiaries shall have received funds from Matson and
Pasha to pay in full the Notes Payoff Amount. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Horizon shall notify the trustees under the First Lien Notes
and the Second Lien Notes not later than forty (40) days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date of its intention to exercise its optional redemption
rights pursuant to the applicable Note Documents and deliver to Pasha not
later than thirty-five (35) days prior to the Closing Date copies of such
notices. As part of the Transactions, Horizon shall take all actions necessary
under the Convertible Notes Indenture for the release of all Liens and
Encumbrances securing the same on the Acquired Hawaii Business, including,
without limitation, obtaining the opinion of counsel required to be delivered
by Horizons counsel pursuant to Section 16.04 of the Convertible Notes
Indenture for the release of Liens and Encumbrances with respect to the
Acquired Hawaii Business.

 

Section 6.22 _Implementation of Step Plan_. Prior to the Closing, each of
Horizon and Pasha shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts
to implement the step plan set forth on _Schedule 6.23_ (as may be amended or
modified in accordance with the next sentence, the " _Step Plan_ "). Each of
Horizon and Pasha shall, to the extent appropriate or desirable in furtherance
of the consummation of the Transactions, discuss with each other in good faith
and, if mutually agreed, make such changes, amendments or modifications to
the Step Plan. Each party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
prepare the filings, notices and other documentation necessary or desirable to
implement the Step Plan that are designated in the Step Plan to be prepared
by such party; _provided_ , that each party shall give the other party and
its Representatives a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
document, and shall consider in good faith and incorporate any comments
provided by such other party and its Representatives.

date (except for those representations and warranties which address matters
only as of an earlier date which shall have been true and correct as of such

to be so true and correct has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Hawaii Material Adverse Effect.
Pasha shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Horizon by an
executive officer of Horizon to such effect.

 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Horizon_. Each of Horizon and Hawaii LLC

to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is further subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver in writing by Horizon, if permissible under
applicable Law) on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:

 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Pasha (i) set forth in _Sections 4.1_  (Organization, Standing and Corporate
Power), _4.2(a)_ (Authority; Noncontravention) and _4.4_ (Brokers and Other
Advisors) shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing
Date, as if made as of such date (except for those representations and
warranties which address matters only as of an earlier date which shall have
been true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date), and
(ii) each of the other representations and warranties of Pasha set forth in
_Article IV_ shall be true and correct (without giving effect to any exception
or qualification contained therein relating to materiality or a Pasha Material
Adverse Effect) as of the Closing Date, as if made as of such date (except
for those representations and warranties which address matters only as of an
earlier date which shall have been true and correct as of such earlier date)
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Pasha Material Adverse Effect. Horizon
shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Pasha by an executive
officer of Pasha to such effect.

 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Pasha_. Pasha shall have performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this
Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and Horizon shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of Pasha by an executive officer of Pasha to such
effect.

 

Section 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither Horizon nor Pasha may
rely on the failure of any condition set forth in  _Section 7.1_, _Section
7.2_ and _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure
was caused by such partys failure to use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.5 _Certain Events_. In the event that (x) all of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied (other than the
condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ and the conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) and (y) all of the conditions to
the Closing set forth in  _Article VI_ of the Merger Agreement have been
satisfied (other than the conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at or immediately prior to the Closing, including the condition contemplated
by _Section 6.2(d)_ thereof) except that the condition in _Section
6.1(b)(ii)_ has not been satisfied, Pasha may notify Horizon in writing that
(1) it irrevocably waives the closing condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_
and (2) it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Transactions (such
notice, the " _Transaction Notification_ "). Within thirty (30) days following
delivery of the Transaction Notification, Horizon shall elect to, by written
notice to Pasha:

 

(a) waive the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ immediately, effective
upon the delivery of such notice by Horizon, in which case the Closing shall
occur pursuant to _Section 1.3_; or

 



70 (b) irrevocably commit to waive the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_
on the date that is forty (40) days prior to the End Date if the closing
condition set forth in _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ of the Merger Agreement has not
been satisfied or waived by such date.

 

If Horizon fails to deliver such written notice to Pasha within thirty (30)
days following delivery of the Transaction Notification, Horizon shall
be deemed to have made the election in _Section 7.5(a)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein (including _Section 9.3_), upon the
proper delivery of the Transaction Notification following the satisfaction of
all of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VII_ (other than the
condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ and the conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), Pasha shall have no obligation to
pay the Antitrust Termination Fee.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

Section 8.1 _Indemnification by Pasha_. From and after the Closing Date, each
of Pasha and Hawaii LLC, jointly and severally, shall save, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless Horizon, its Subsidiaries, their successors and assigns and
each of their respective Affiliates and Representatives, from and against any
and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards,
judgments, settlements, penalties, fines, and out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys and accountants fees, costs and other out-
of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending
the foregoing) and Taxes (but only to the extent arising from a non-Tax
claim, it being understood that claims for Taxes are addressed in _Section
6.16_) (hereinafter collectively, " _Losses_ ") asserted against,
incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing as a result of,
arising out of or relating to the following:

(a) the Hawaii Business after the Closing;

(b) the Transferred Assets;

 

(c) the Transferred Liabilities;

 

(d) Pasha and Hawaii LLCs indemnification obligations set forth in, and any
Losses described in,  _Section 2.6, Section 6.5(b)_ and _(d)_ , and _Section
6.6(c)_ of this Agreement;

(e) any withdrawal liability with respect to the pension plans set forth on
_Schedule 8.1(e)_ hereto to the extent resulting from any action or inaction
by Pasha or Hawaii LLC, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
after the Closing;

 

(f) any Antitrust Proceeding or other Action under Antitrust Laws as a result
of, arising out of, or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Hawaii Business or the assets of the Hawaii Business,
but only in the event that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement occurs substantially contemporaneously with the Closing
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such indemnity shall
cover only monetary Losses; or

 



71 (g) any breach of any covenant or agreement by Pasha or any of its Affiliates
contained in this Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (including as a result of the action or failure
to act of Pasha or any of its Affiliates) after the Closing.

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by Horizon_. Horizon shall save, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Pasha, Hawaii LLC, their successors and assigns,
and each of their respective Affiliates and Representatives, successors and
assigns, from and against any and all Losses asserted against, incurred,
sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing, as a result of, arising out of
or relating to:

(a) the Excluded Assets;

 

(b) the Excluded Liabilities;

 

(c) any stockholder litigation, arbitration, suit, proceeding, action or
dispute against Horizon or any of its Affiliates that arises out of or
relates to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (the " _Indemnified
Litigation_ "), subject to _Section 8.3(f)_; or

 

(d) any breach of any covenant or agreement by Horizon or any of its
Affiliates contained in this Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other
document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including as a result of the
action or failure to act of Horizon or any of its Affiliates) after the
Closing.

 

Section 8.3 _Procedures_.

 

(a) A party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") in respect
of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by any
person (other than the Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates) against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall deliver notice (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") in respect thereof to the party against whom indemnity is sought
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with reasonable promptness after receipt by
such Indemnified Party of notice of a Third Party Claim, and shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to deliver a Claim
Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this _Article VIII_ except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party against any and all Losses that may result
from a Third Party Claim that is exclusively for civil monetary damages at law
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days
of receipt of a Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party in respect of such
Third Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the

 



72  defense of any Third Party Claim for equitable or injunctive relief, any
claim that would impose criminal liability or damages, and the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to defend, at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party, any such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim within the time period and otherwise in
accordance with the first sentence of this _Section 8.3(b)_, the Indemnified
Party shall have the sole right to assume the defense of and to settle such
Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Party Claim
requiring payment of any amounts without the consent of the Indemnifying Party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless it agrees to
waive its rights against the Indemnifying Party with respect to that portion
of indemnification related to such settled Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of
such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to the Third Party Claim
(including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that
representation by counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying
Party and such Indemnified Party may present such counsel with a conflict of
interest. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys expense,
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to
the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified
Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if
such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) involves a finding or admission
of wrongdoing, (ii) does not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect
of such Third Party Claim or (iii) imposes equitable remedies or any
obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money
damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder.

 

(c) An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification in respect of, arising out of
or involving a Loss or a claim or demand hereunder that does not involve a
Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall deliver a Claim Notice in
respect thereof to the Indemnifying Party with reasonable promptness after
becoming aware of facts supporting such Direct Claim, and shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to deliver a Claim
Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this _Article VIII_ except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it
may have to the Indemnified Party or otherwise than pursuant to this _Article
VIII_. If the Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an indemnification
obligation or does not notify the Indemnified Party within ten (10) days
following its receipt of a Claim Notice in respect of a Direct Claim that the
Indemnifying Party

 



73  disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder, such Direct Claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such Claim Notice shall be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the amount of such liability promptly to the Indemnified Party
on demand. If the Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an indemnification
obligation but asserts that it is obligated to pay a lesser amount than that
claimed by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay such lesser
amount promptly to the Indemnified Party, without prejudice to or waiver of
the Indemnified Partys claim for the difference.

 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require that any action be
made or brought against any other Person before action is brought or claim is
made against it hereunder by the Indemnified Party.

(e) Under no circumstances shall any Indemnified Party be indemnified for any
special, consequential, punitive, indirect or exemplary damages (except, in
each case, to the extent included in a Third Party Claim). The party seeking
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss which forms the basis of
an indemnification claim hereunder. For purposes of computing the amount of
Losses incurred, paid or accrued by a party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ ,
any net insurance proceeds or other reimbursements or benefits relating to
such Losses that a party actually receives shall be subtracted from such
Losses, or delivered to the Indemnifying Party, in the event such Loss has
already been paid by such party. No party hereto shall be obligated to
indemnify any other Person with respect to any Losses with respect to any
matter if such matter was included in the calculation of the adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.4_.

 

(f) In the event of any Losses asserted against, incurred, sustained or
suffered by Pasha, Hawaii LLC, their successors and assigns or any of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives as a result of, arising out of or
relating to the Indemnified Litigation pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_, the
parties agree that Horizon, on the one hand, and Pasha, on the other hand,
shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the first two hundred
thousand dollars ($200,000) of any such Losses and Horizon shall be solely
responsible for any such Losses in excess of the first two hundred thousand
dollars ($200,000).

 

(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 10.7_, each Indemnifying Party
hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which an
action in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought against any Indemnified
Party for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Party may have under this
Agreement with respect to such action or the matters alleged therein
and agrees that process may be served on each Indemnifying Party with respect
to such claim anywhere.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the provisions
of this _Section 8.3_ shall not apply with respect to Tax matters (other than
Taxes arising from non-Tax claims), which Tax matters shall be governed by
_Section 6.16_ above.

 

Section 8.4 _Joint Interest in Claims_. Notwithstanding Section 8.3 and
subject to Section 2.6, with respect to any claim against a third party that
involves either (x) an asset of the type described in Section 2.1(p) a portion
of which is a Contributed Asset and a portion of which

 



74  is an Excluded Asset, or (y) a liability or obligation a portion of which is
a Assumed Liability and a portion of which is an Excluded Liability, and with
respect to which the respective claims, rights and/or obligations of Pasha
and Hawaii LLC, on the one hand, and Horizon and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, are unable to be separated or partitioned (a " _Shared Claim_ "):

 

(a) The parties will cooperate and work together in good faith to pursue and
resolve the Shared Claim and will make available to the other party all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in such partys
possession or under the such partys control relating thereto as is reasonably
required to pursue and resolve the Shared Claim. The party with the
greater economic interest in such claim, right and/or obligation (the "
_Majority Party_ ") shall control and direct, and shall pay all costs and
expenses associated with, the prosecution of such Shared Claim; _provided_
that the other party (the " _Minority Party_ ") shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and to participate in the Shared Claim at its own
expense. If a party disputes the right of the other party to control and
direct a Shared Claim (a " _Dispute_ "), such party will deliver written
notice of such Dispute to the other party. During the 60-day period following
delivery of notice of a Dispute, the parties shall use good faith efforts to
resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved in such 60-day period,
the parties will discuss in good faith the submission of the Dispute to a
mutually acceptable alternative dispute resolution procedure. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Minority Party shall reasonably determine that
representation by counsel to the Majority Party of both the Majority Party and
the Minority Party may present such counsel with a conflict of interest, or
the Shared Claim involves anything other than a claim or demand for civil
monetary damages, then the Majority Party shall not control and direct the
Shared Claim on behalf of the Minority Party and each of the Majority Party
and the Minority Party shall jointly control and direct such Shared Claim at
their own cost and expense.

(b) Neither party shall, without the prior written consent of the other party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), enter into any
settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to such Shared Claim. In the event of a recovery relating to a Shared Claim,
such recovery shall be allocated among the parties in the same proportion as
their respective interests in such Shared Claim or as the parties shall
otherwise mutually agree.

Section 8.5  _Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or
Knowledge_. If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each
party expressly reserves the right to seek indemnity or other remedy for any
Losses, notwithstanding any investigation by, disclosure to or knowledge of
such party in respect of any fact or circumstances that reveals the occurrence
of any such breach, whether before or after the execution and delivery hereof.

 

Section 8.6 _Sole and Exclusive Remedies_. Following the Closing, the rights
and remedies of Horizon and Pasha under  _Section 1.4_, _Section 2.6_,
_Section 6.5(b)_ and _(d)_ , _Section 6.6(c)_ , _Section 6.16_ and this
_Article VIII_ are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and
remedies which Horizon and Pasha may have under this Agreement or otherwise
against each other with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for monetary relief (other than causes of action arising from
fraud); _provided_ that this  _Section 8.6_ shall not limit a Partys rights
to specific performance under _Section 10.9_ in the event of a breach,
failure to perform or default under any covenant that is to be performed after
the Closing.

 



75 ARTICLE IX

 

 _TERMINATION_

 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by either of Horizon or Pasha:

 

(i) if the Transactions shall not have been consummated on or before February
11, 2016 (the " _End Date_ ") (it being agreed that (x) if, pursuant to
_Section 1.3(a)_, the Closing Date is to occur after the then-applicable End
Date as a result of the provisions of clause (B) of _Section 1.3(a)_ but
would have occurred on or prior to the then-applicable End Date pursuant to
the provisions of clause (A) of _Section 1.3(a)_, then the End Date shall be
automatically extended to the third Business Day after the date on which the
Closing is to occur pursuant to such clause (B), and (y) if the End Date in
the Merger Agreement is extended pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ thereof,
then the End Date in this Agreement shall be automatically extended for the
same period); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the event that a termination
notice is delivered by Pasha pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ and the Hawaii
Material Adverse Effect identified in the termination notice is capable of
being cured by Horizon and such Hawaii Material Adverse Effect is cured by
Horizon, the End Date shall be extended by the number of days that elapse from
the receipt of such notice until such Hawaii Material Adverse Effect is cured
in accordance with _Section 9.1(e)_, subject to a maximum extension of
forty-five (45) calendar days; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that
Pasha delivers the Transaction Notification within ninety (90) days of the End
Date, the End Date shall be extended to the date that is ninety (90) days
following the delivery of the Transaction Notification; _provided_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ shall
not be available to a party if the failure of the Transactions to have been
consummated on or before the End Date was primarily due to the failure of such
party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_
shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such final, non-
appealable Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

(iii) if the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms;

(b) by the mutual written consent of Horizon and Pasha;

 

(c) by Pasha if Horizon or Hawaii LLC shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ and
(ii) cannot be cured by Horizon by the End Date or, 

 



76  if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
calendar days following receipt of written notice from Pasha stating Pashas
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ and
the basis for such termination; _provided_ , that Pasha shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ if it is
then in material breach of any representation, warranties, covenants or other
agreements hereunder that would result in the closing conditions set forth in
_Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ not being satisfied;

 

(d) by Horizon if Pasha shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and
(ii) cannot be cured by Pasha by the End Date or, if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt
of written notice from Horizon stating Horizons intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ and the basis for such
termination; _provided_ , that Horizon shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ if it is then in material
breach of any representation, warranties, covenants or other
agreements hereunder that would result in the closing conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ not being satisfied;

 

(e) by Pasha, if since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred a
Hawaii Material Adverse Effect, which Hawaii Material Adverse Effect cannot
be cured by Horizon or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured
within forty-five (45) calendar days following receipt of written notice from
Pasha stating Pashas intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(e)_ and the basis for such termination; or

(f) by Horizon, if Pasha has failed to actively and in good faith pursue
Antitrust Clearance and such failure shall not have been cured by Pasha within
thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of written notice from Horizon
stating Horizons intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this 
_Section 9.1(f)_.

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void (other than this  _Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_, _Section 9.4_,
_Article X_ , _Section 6.4_ and _Section 6.6(c)_, all of which shall survive
termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part
of Pasha, Horizon or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to _Section 9.3_ and
_Section 9.4_ (including the limitations on liability contained therein),
no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages
arising out of any willful or material breach of this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive in accordance with its terms
termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.3 _Antitrust Termination Fee_.

pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ or  _(ii)_ and at the time of such
termination the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ and/or _(b)_ are
not then satisfied and all other conditions to the Closing set forth in
_Article VII_ shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms

 



77  are to be satisfied at the Closing but which conditions would be satisfied
or would be capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of
such termination) or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Horizon pursuant to
_Section 9.1(f_), then Pasha shall pay or cause to be paid as directed by
Horizon a termination fee of thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) (the "
_Antitrust Termination Fee_ ") substantially concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement. Pasha acknowledges and agrees that Pasha shall
be the sole party responsible for the payment of the Antitrust Termination Fee
and Pasha may not seek contribution or payment of funds from any other
Person, including Matson and the Financing Sources, for the payment of the
Antitrust Termination Fee. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto
acknowledge that if any regulatory approval or other condition required for
the consummation of the Merger Agreement has not been obtained or satisfied,
such fact in and of itself shall not give rise to any obligation to pay the
Antitrust Termination Fee under this _Section 9.3_.

 

(b) In no event shall Pasha be required to pay the fee referred to in this
_Section 9.3_ on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that the payment of the
Antitrust Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
Horizon and any other Person (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions in the
event any such payment becomes due and payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_,
and, upon and subject to payment of the Antitrust Termination Fee, neither
Pasha nor any of its Affiliates or its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives shall have any further
liability, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, to
Horizon, Matson or any other Person under this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for any termination hereof or thereof, and none
of Horizon, Matson or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain
any claim, action or proceeding against Pasha or any of its Affiliates or its
and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and
Representatives arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or
the Guarantee, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for any
termination hereof or thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that
the Antitrust Termination Fee is paid, no Person may seek specific
performance under this Agreement.

(c) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Horizon.

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

Agreement.

Agreement by Horizon pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ thereof, Horizon shall
pay or cause to be paid as directed by Pasha a termination fee of (i)
$4,950,400 plus (ii) all of Pashas documented, out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (collectively, the " _Termination Fee_ ") substantially concurrently
with the termination of this Agreement.

 



78 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Horizon or Pasha
pursuant to  _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_ following termination of the Merger
Agreement by Parent (as defined in the Merger Agreement) pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ thereof, Horizon shall pay or cause to be paid as directed by
Pasha the Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days of such termination.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Horizon or Pasha
pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(iii)_ following termination of the Merger

(ii) an Alternative Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall have
been publicly disclosed after the date hereof and not publicly withdrawn prior
to the date of Horizon Stockholder Meeting (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), and (iii) within twelve (12) months of the date the Merger
Agreement is terminated, Horizon enters into an agreement with respect to any
Alternative Proposal, then Horizon shall pay or cause to be paid as directed
by Pasha the Termination Fee on the date of consummation of such transaction.

 

(d) In no event shall Horizon be required to pay the fees referred to in this
_Section 9.4_ on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that the payment of the
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Pasha and
any other Person (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions in the
event any such payment becomes due and payable, and, upon payment of the
Termination Fee, neither Horizon nor any of its Affiliates or its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives

tort or otherwise, to Pasha or any other Person under this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for any termination hereof, and neither Pasha
nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action
or proceeding against Horizon or any of its Affiliates or its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any
matters forming the basis for any termination hereof. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that a Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) become payable under the Merger Agreement, the Termination Fee (as
defined herein) shall also become payable.

(e) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Pasha.

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this  _Section
9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement.

conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by Pasha or
Horizon in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof

on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

otherwise) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws

laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other

other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that (i) all actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state

otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that, if for any
reason Horizon, Hawaii LLC or Pasha shall have failed to perform any of their
respective obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this

limitation of any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or
