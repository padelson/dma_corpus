  Exhibit A |  |  |  | Form of Tender and Voting Agreement AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of May 1, 2008 by and among Autodesk, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Switch Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Moldflow
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized
terms used in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings ascribed
thereto in _Article X_.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Merger Sub shall, as promptly as
practicable, commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the
outstanding shares (the " _Company Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock, at a
price of Twenty Two Dollars ($22.00) per Company Share, net to the holder
thereof in cash (such amount, or any different amount per Company Share that
may be paid pursuant to the Offer, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Offer Price_ "), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein. 

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, following the consummation of the Offer,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company and each Company Share that
is then outstanding will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, all upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.

WHEREAS, each of the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub, as well as
the Company Board, has (i) determined that this Agreement is advisable, (ii)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, taken together, are at a price and on
terms that are in the best interests of their respective stockholders
and (iii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, each of the directors and executive officers of the
Company, in their respective capacities as stockholders of the Company, have
entered into Tender and Voting Agreements with Parent substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each, a " _Tender and Voting Agreement_
" and collectively, the " _Tender and Voting Agreements_ ").

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement, the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A.
(formerly known as EquiServe Trust Company, N.A.) (" _Computershare_ ") are
entering into an amendment (the " _Rights Plan Amendment_ ") to that certain
Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated as of January 29, 2003 between the
Company and Computershare (the " _Company Rights Plan_ "), so as to render the
rights (the " _Company Rights_ ") issued thereunder inapplicable to this
Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) _Terms of Offer; Conditions to Offer_. Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the Company Shares at a price per
Company Share, subject to the terms of _Section 1.1(b)_ and this sentence,
equal to the Offer Price as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but
in no event more than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, unless the Company
is not prepared to file the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC on the same day that
Parent and Merger Sub are prepared to commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer, in which event Parent and Merger Sub
shall not be required to commence the Offer until the Company is prepared to
file the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC), provided that (x) this Agreement shall
not have been terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ and (y) none of the
events set forth in clauses (C)(1)  (C)(6) of _Annex A_ hereto, inclusive,
shall have occurred. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and to
pay for any Company Shares tendered (and the obligation of Parent to
cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Company Shares
tendered) shall be subject only to:

(i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, prior to the then
scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to
time pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)_), there be validly tendered in accordance
with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of shares of Company
Common Stock that, together with the Company Shares then owned by Parent and
Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority of (x) all then
outstanding Company Shares, _plus_  (y) all Company Shares issuable upon the
exercise of all then outstanding Company Options that are vested and
exercisable as of any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer or that
would be vested and exercisable at any time within 90 calendar days following
the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer assuming that the holder of
such Company Options satisfies the vesting conditions applicable thereto (and
after giving effect to the acceleration of any vesting that may occur as a
result of the Offer), _plus_ (z) all Company Shares issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange of any then outstanding securities (other
than Company Options) that are exercisable or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, Company Shares at any time within 90 calendar days
following the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer; and



 

-2- (ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto.

Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price
or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer;
_provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or
previously approved by the Company in writing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
may make any change to the terms and conditions of the Offer that:



     | (A) | decreases the Offer Price; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer; 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | reduces the number of Company Shares to be purchased in the
Offer; 
---|---|--- 



     | (D) | imposes conditions to the Offer that are in addition to the
conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto and adverse to the
Companys stockholders;  
---|---|--- 



     | (E) | amends the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_
hereto so as to broaden the scope of such conditions to the Offer; 
---|---|--- 


     | (F) | extends the Offer in any manner other than pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms of _Section 1.1(c)_; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (G) | amends or waives the Minimum Condition. 
---|---|--- 

The conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto are for the sole
benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub,
in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in their sole
discretion, other than the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by Parent
and Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company. The failure
by Parent and Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

(b) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on
or after the date hereof and prior to Merger Subs acceptance for payment of,
and payment for, Company Shares pursuant to the Offer.

(c) _Extension and Expiration of Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Offer, the Offer shall expire at midnight, Eastern
standard time, on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (for this purpose
calculated in  



 

-3-  accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date
the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act); _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

(i) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer, including the
Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth on _Annex A_ hereto, are
not satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer,
Merger Sub may (but shall not be required to) extend the Offer for one or
more successive extension periods of ten (10) Business Days each in order to
permit the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer;

(ii) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or the
Nasdaq that is applicable to the Offer;

(iii) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in clause
(A)(1) and (A)(2) of  _Annex A_ hereto are not satisfied or waived as of any
then scheduled expiration date of the Offer, but all of the other conditions
to the Offer set forth on _Annex A_ hereto shall have been satisfied or
waived as of the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer, then Merger Sub
shall extend the Offer for successive ten (10) Business Day periods each in
order to permit additional time to satisfy such conditions to the Offer; and

(iv) in the event that the Minimum Condition is not satisfied as of any then
scheduled expiration date of the Offer, but all of the other conditions
to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto shall have been satisfied or
waived as of the then scheduled expiration date of the Offer, then Merger Sub
shall extend the Offer for one or more periods, each of a length to be
determined solely by Parent, to permit additional time to satisfy the Minimum
Condition; _provided, however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required
pursuant to this clause (iv) to extend the Offer for more than an aggregate of
thirty (30) calendar days beyond the initial expiration date of the Offer;

_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i)(iv) of
this  _Section 1.1(c)_, inclusive, in no event shall Merger Sub be required
to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date (as it may be extended
pursuant hereto); and _provided further_ , that the foregoing clauses (i)(iv)
of this  _Section 1.1(c)_, inclusive, shall not be deemed to impair, limit
or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article VIII_ hereof.

(d) _Payment for Company Shares_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, promptly (within the meaning of Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act) after the applicable expiration date of the
Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section 1.1(c)_). The Offer
Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in
cash, subject to  _Section 1.1(g)_.



 

-4- (e) _Subsequent Offering Period_. After the expiration of the Offer, Merger
Sub may (but shall not be required to), and the Offer Documents shall reserve
the right to, extend the Offer for a subsequent offering period (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) of not less than three (3) nor
more than twenty (20) Business Days, which subsequent offering period shall
commence immediately following the expiration of the Offer. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) immediately accept for payment, and
promptly pay for, all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as so extended by such subsequent offering period, as
any such Company Shares are tendered during such subsequent offering period.
The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, as so extended by such subsequent
offering period, shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to 
_Section 1.1(g)_.

(f) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date the
Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act),
Parent and Merger Sub shall:

(i) prepare and file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer, which
shall contain as an exhibit or incorporate by reference an Offer to Purchase,
or portions thereof (the " _Offer to Purchase_ "), and forms of the letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement, if any, in respect of the Offer
(together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
"); and

(ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to all holders of Company
Shares (collectively, the " _Company Stockholders_ ").

Subject to the provisions of _Section 6.2_, the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents may include a description of the determinations, approvals
and recommendations of the Company Board set forth in _Section 1.2(a)_. The
Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in writing all
information concerning the Company that may be required by applicable
securities laws or reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion
in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause
the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects
with the Exchange Act and all other Legal Requirements. Parent and Merger Sub
hereby agree that the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, when filed with the
SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the Company
Stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided, however_ , that no
representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
information supplied by the Company or any of its officers, directors,
representatives, agents or employees in writing  



 

-5-  specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule TO
or the Offer Documents. The Company hereby agrees that the
information provided by the Company in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO or the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Sub shall take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the
Company and its counsel any and all written comments that Parent, Merger Sub
or their counsel may receive in writing from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any written response to any
such written comments of the SEC or its staff.

(g) _Required Withholding_. Each of Merger Sub, Parent and the depositary for
the Offer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to the Offer such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state, local or non-U.S. law. To the
extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) _Company Determinations, Approvals and Recommendations_. The Company
hereby approves and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants to

contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken together, are
at a price and on terms that are in the best interests of the Company and the
holders of Company Shares;

(iii) unanimously approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and the Tender and Voting
Agreements, which approval, to the extent applicable, constituted approval

-6-  provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL as a result of which this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, as well as the Tender and Voting Agreements and the transactions
contemplated thereby, are not and will not be subject to the provisions of, or
any restrictions under, the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, whether
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ under circumstances
in which the Company is or may in the future be required to pay the
Termination Fee Amount pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.4(b)_ or
otherwise and thereafter Merger Sub elects to continue the Offer; and

(iv) unanimously resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Shares
accept the Offer, tender their Company Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the
Offer and adopt this Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law;

_provided, however_ , that such recommendation may be withheld, withdrawn,
amended or modified solely in accordance with the terms of _Section 6.2_. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the foregoing determinations and
approvals in the Offer Documents and, to the extent that the foregoing
recommendation of the Company Board is not withheld, withdrawn, amended or
modified in accordance with _Section 6.2_, the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of such recommendation in the Offer Documents.

(b) _Schedule 14D-9_. The Company shall:

(i) file with the SEC, concurrently with the filing by Parent and Merger Sub

(ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed to the Company Stockholders,

respective reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver) to the
Company any  



 

-8-  and all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in

circumstances in which the Company is or may in the future be required to pay
the Termination Fee Amount pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.4(b)_
or otherwise, and Parent and Merger Sub elect to continue the Offer (as may
be amended) notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement pursuant to

1.3 _Company Board Following Appointment Time_.

(a) _Composition of Company Board_. Effective upon the initial acceptance for
payment by Merger Sub of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Appointment Time_ ," the use of which term herein shall not, unless the
context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall exercise its
rights under this _Section 1.3(a)_) and from time to time thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the Company
Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by
multiplying (x) the total number of directors on the Company Board (after
giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this
_Section 1.3_) by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
Company Shares held by Parent and Merger Sub (after giving effect to the
Company Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of which
is the total number of then outstanding Company Shares. Promptly following a
request by Parent, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause the
individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company
Board, including (at the election of Parent) either by increasing the size of
the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing the
resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to
enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to
the Company Board; _provided, however_ , that at least two (2) members of the
Company Board immediately prior to the Appointment Time shall be entitled to
remain on the Company Board at all times from and after the Appointment Time
until the Effective Time, and the Company shall take any and all action
necessary to enable such persons to remain on the Company Board during such
period (any such directors being referred to herein as " _Continuing
Directors_ "); _provided further, however_ , that notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall
not be required to take any action to replace any of the Continuing Directors
(or otherwise appoint any person to serve as a "Continuing Director") if no
Continuing Directors remain on the Company Board. In the event that only one
 



 

-9-  Continuing Director shall remain on the Company Board (whether as a result
of the resignation of other Continuing Directors or for any other reason),
the sole remaining Continuing Director shall be entitled to elect or
designate another person to serve as a "Continuing Director," and the Company
shall take all action to cause any person so elected or designated to be
appointed to the Company Board (any person so appointed to the Company Board
being deemed to be a "Continuing Director" for all purposes hereunder).

(b) _Composition of Company Board Committees_. From time to time after the
Appointment Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause the
individuals so designated by Parent to constitute substantially the same
percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on: (i)
each committee of the Company Board; (ii) each board of directors of each
Subsidiary of the Company; and (iii) each committee of each such board of
directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case to the fullest
extent permitted by all applicable Legal Requirements, including the
Marketplace Rules of the Nasdaq Global Market (the " _Nasdaq Marketplace
Rules_ ").

(c) _Compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rules_. Promptly after the Appointment
Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a
"controlled company" as defined by Rule 4350(c) the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules
and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status.
Each Continuing Director shall be an "independent director" as defined by
Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the
Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq Marketplace Rules
and at least one Continuing Director shall be an "audit committee financial
expert" as defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K and the instructions
thereto.

(d)  _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to
appoint Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The
Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to this _Section
1.3_ and Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations
under this _Section 1.3_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9
such information with respect to the Company and its directors and officers
as is required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 1.3_. Parent shall provide to the Company
in writing, and be solely responsible for any information with respect to
itself and its nominees, directors, officers and affiliates, required by such
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(e) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents
designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ and there shall be any Continuing
Directors, the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors (or
the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing
Director) shall be required in order to:

(i) amend or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment
or termination of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company;



 

-10- (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or
other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement;

(iii) waive any of the Companys rights under this Agreement; or

(iv) make any other determination with respect to any action to be taken or
not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger.

1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) _90% Top-Up Option_.

(i) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option
(the " _90% Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, to purchase with a promissory note, bearing
simple interest at 6% per annum, and due thirty (30) days after the purchase
(a " _Promissory Note_ "), at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, that
number of shares of Common Stock (the " _90% Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal
to the lowest number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries and
controlled Affiliates at the time of such exercise, shall constitute
ten thousand (10,000) shares more than 90% of the shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the 90% Top-Up
Option Shares); _provided, however_ , (x) that the 90% Top-Up Option shall not
be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold
would be reached (assuming the issuance of the 90% Top-Up Option Shares), (y)
that in no event shall the 90% Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of
shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the Companys total authorized and
unissued shares of Company Common Stock, and (z) that in no event shall the
Top-Up Option be exercised by both of Parent and Merger Sub.

(ii) Provided that no Legal Requirement, Order or other legal impediment shall
prohibit the exercise of the 90% Top-Up Option or the issuance of the 90%
Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise make such exercise or
issuance illegal, Parent or Merger Sub may exercise the 90% Top-Up Option, in
whole but not in part, at any one time after the Appointment Time and prior
to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ hereof.

(iii) In the event Parent or Merger Sub wishes to exercise the 90% Top-Up
Option, Parent or Merger Sub shall send to the Company a written notice (a "
_90% Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ," the date of which notice is referred to herein
as the " _90% Top-Up Notice Date_ ") specifying the denominations of the
certificate or certificates evidencing the 90% Top-Up Option Shares which
such party wishes to receive, and the place, time and date for the closing of
the purchase and sale pursuant to the 90% Top-Up Option (the " _90% Top-Up
Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the 90% Top-
Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Parent or Merger Sub
confirming the number of 90% Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase
price therefore (the  



 

-11-  " _90% Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the 90% Top-Up Closing, Parent or
Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for
the 90% Top-Up Option Shares, by delivery of a Promissory Note in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the amount specified in the 90% Top-Up Notice
Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued to the party exercising the
90% Top-Up Option a certificate or certificates representing the 90% Top-Up
Option Shares. Such certificates may include any legends that are required by
federal or state securities laws.

Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by stockholders who shall have neither
voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall
have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.7_. Such stockholders shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to
perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL

exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in
the manner provided in _Section 2.8_.



 

-14- (ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment

deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_, an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the Merger Consideration and (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding shares of Company Common Stock then owned Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or any direct or indirect, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether pursuant
to the Offer or otherwise)) (such cash amount being referred to herein as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates
(the " _Certificates_ ") and each holder of record (as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time) of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry
form, in each case which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company
Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment  



 

-15-  Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent or
delivery of an agents message in respect of shares held in book-entry
form, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such
Certificates or the holders of shares held in book-entry form shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent
shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this
_Section 2.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates shall be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name
other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor
are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting
such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent)
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state, local or
non-U.S. law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on
the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding  



 

-16-  immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their
Certificates evidencing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter look for
payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock evidenced by such Certificates solely to Parent, as
general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article II_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, if any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date
on which the Merger Consideration contemplated by this _Section 2.8_ in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Authority, any amounts payable in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims of interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate theretofore representing any shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares) shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 2.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company
Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.7_; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require
the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and
necessary action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub.

-52- ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons

date hereof) request in writing that (i) each Person that entered into a
confidentiality or other similar agreement with the Company or any of its
Affiliates since January 1, 2008 and (ii) each Person to which the Company or
any of its Affiliates furnished confidential information since January 1, 2008
under a confidentiality or other similar agreement existing as of such date,
in each case in connection with a potential Acquisition Transaction, return or
destroy (to the extent destruction of such information is permitted by such
confidentiality agreement) all confidential information furnished to such
Person by or behalf of the Company thereunder. Such written requests shall
contain a notice to each Person that any information that is sent or conveyed
to the Company in the future will not be treated as confidential pursuant to
any such confidentiality or other similar agreement.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Appointment Time, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause any of their respective directors, officers or other

advisors or representatives retained by any of them (collectively, the "

directly or indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce the making,
submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction;

(ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of

any of its Subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger
Sub), or take any other action intended to assist or facilitate any inquiries
or the making of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction;

(iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction;

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction;



 

-53- (v) execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or

Proposal or Acquisition Transaction;

(vi) terminate, amend, waive or fail to enforce any rights under any
"standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Person (other than Parent); or

 

(vii) propose to take any of the foregoing actions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Appointment Time, the Company
Board may, directly or indirectly through Company Representatives, subject to
the Companys compliance with the provisions of this _Section 6.1_, (A)
engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person that has
made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in
writing that the Company Board reasonably concludes in good faith
(after consultation with Jefferies and Co. or other financial advisor of
nationally recognized standing and the Companys outside legal counsel)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and/or (B)
furnish to any Person that has made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide_ ,
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in writing that the Company Board reasonably
concludes in good faith (after consultation with Jefferies and Co. or other
financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and the Companys outside
legal counsel) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality and "standstill" agreement, the
terms of which are no less favorable to the Company than those set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement and those relating to "standstill" obligations
set forth in the Exclusivity Agreement (and which expressly permits the
Company to fulfill its obligations to Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement), provided that (in the case of any action proposed to be taken
pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) or (B)), (1) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall have breached or violated (or because of actions
taken by any Company Representative, be deemed, pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 6.1_, to have breached or violated) the terms of this _Section
6.1_, (2) the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action is required in order
to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law, (3) prior to engaging or participating in any such discussions
or negotiations with, or furnishing any non-public information to, such
Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of
such Person and all of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal (unless such Acquisition Proposal is in written form, in which case
the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof) and of the Companys intention
to engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-
public information to, such Person, and (4) contemporaneously with furnishing
any non-public information to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-
public information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been
previously furnished by the Company to Parent).

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.1_ by any Company Representative
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.1_ by the Company.



 

-54- (d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
6.1(b)_, the Company shall promptly, and in all cases within twenty four (24)
hours of its receipt, notify Parent orally and in writing (whether or not the
Company is a party to or otherwise bound by a confidentiality or other similar
agreement that purports to prohibit the Company from disclosing any of the
following information) of the following: (i) any Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
any request for information that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) any inquiry with respect to, or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity
of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current
basis, of the status and material details of any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, including material amendments or proposed amendments as
to price, closing conditions and other material terms thereof.

(e) In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent prior written
notice of any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is
reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal, an inquiry relating
to a potential Acquisition Proposal, or a request to provide nonpublic
information to any Person, with Parent receiving a similar amount of notice
of such meeting as is provided to members of the Company Board.

6.2 _Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Subject to the terms of _Section 6.2(b)_, the Company Board shall (i)
recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the Offer, tender their
Company Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ ") and (ii) include the Company Board Recommendation
(with respect to the Offer) in the Schedule 14D-9 and permit Parent to include
the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

(b) Subject to the terms of this _Section 6.2(b)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
determinations set forth in _Section 1.2(a)_ or the Company
Board Recommendation (a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ");
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board
may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time prior to the
Appointment Time if and only if (i) the Company Board has received an
Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have
breached or violated (or because of actions taken by any Company
Representative, be deemed, pursuant to the terms of _Section 6.1_, to have
breached or violated) the terms of _Section 6.1_, (iii) the Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and after  



 

-55-  considering in good faith any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent
pursuant to clause (v) below), that, in light of such Superior Proposal,
the Company Board is required to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law, (iv) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business
Days notice that it intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
(which notice shall attach a copy of the most recent version of all Contracts
to which the Company is proposed to be a party relating to the Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal) and
the opportunity to meet with the Company Board, its financial advisor and its
outside legal counsel, all with the purpose and intent of enabling Parent and
the Company to discuss and negotiate in good faith a modification of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby
(as may be amended by such discussions) may be effected (it being understood
and hereby agreed that a new five-day notice and negotiation period shall be
required if the Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined to
be a Superior Proposal is revised in any material respect), (v) Parent shall
not have made, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Companys
written notice of its intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change, a counter-offer or proposal that the Company Board reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with Jefferies and Co. or other
financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and its outside legal
counsel, is at least as favorable to Company Stockholders as such Superior
Proposal, and (vi) such Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal after taking into consideration any counter-offer or proposal made by
Parent during the foregoing five-Business Day period.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that the disclosure
of any position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or pursuant to Rule 14d-9 shall
be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change under this Agreement
unless such disclosure is accompanied by and includes an express reaffirmation
of the Company Board Recommendation. In addition, it is understood and agreed
that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement
by the Company that solely describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal shall not (by itself) constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change if such public statement is accompanied by and includes an express
reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation, and a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act shall not (by itself) constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 6.2(c)_ shall be deemed to excuse or relieve the
Company from its covenants, agreements and obligations under this Agreement
or otherwise limit, impair or affect the remedies available to Parent and
Merger Sub under this Agreement and applicable Legal Requirements for any
breach or violation of this Agreement by the Company. 



 

-56- 6.3 _Company Stockholders  Meeting; Short-Form Merger_.

(a) If approval of the Company Stockholders is required under Delaware Law in
order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of the
DGCL, the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (the " _Company
Stockholders  Meeting_") as promptly as practicable following the
Appointment Time for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this
Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law. Nothing herein shall prevent the
Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholders Meeting if
there are insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock necessary to
conduct business at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall
solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder Vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article
VIII_, the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting
upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, whether
or not the Company Board at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or otherwise shall determine
that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the Company
Stockholders reject it. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Companys obligation to establish a record date for,
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting
pursuant to this _Section 6.3(a)_ shall not be limited to, or otherwise
affected by, the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall vote all Company Shares acquired in
the Offer (or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law at the Company Stockholders
Meeting or otherwise. Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub beneficially owned by it, or sign a written consent in lieu of a
meeting of the stockholders of Merger Sub, in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.2_ or this _Section
6.3_, in the event that Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent,
shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding
Company Shares (the " _Short Form Threshold_ ") pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable after such acquisition, without Company Stockholder
Meeting, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

6.4 _Proxy Statement_.

(a) If approval of the Company Stockholders is required by Delaware Law in
order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL,
as soon as practicable following the Appointment Time, the Company and Parent
shall jointly prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the Proxy
Statement for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies from the
Company Stockholders in connection  



 

-57-  with the Merger and the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company and
Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning the
Company or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement. Subject to all applicable Legal Requirements, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated
to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing
thereof with the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or
correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement
shall be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon. The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its staff for
an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and
responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional
information in connection therewith. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party or parties hereto, as the
case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by applicable law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the Nasdaq.

(b) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_,
subject to the terms of  _Section 6.2(b)_, the Company shall include in the
Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation (other than with respect to
the Offer).

6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto
in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the conditions
to the Offer set forth on _Annex A_ hereto and the conditions to the Merger
set forth in _Article VII_ hereof to be satisfied or fulfilled; (ii) obtain
all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any
Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) so as to maintain
and preserve the benefits under such Contracts following the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger);
(iii) obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents,
approvals, Orders and authorizations from  



 

-58-  Governmental Authorities, the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods, making all necessary registrations, declarations and
filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Authorities, if any); (iv) resolve such objections if any, as the FTC, the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ, state antitrust enforcement authorities or
competition authorities of any other nation or jurisdiction or any Person may
assert under the HSR Act or comparable Legal Requirements of any foreign
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (v) execute or deliver any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement. With respect to clause (ii) above, (A)
all fees, costs and expenses to obtain, and satisfy the conditions of the
consents to be obtained by the Company hereunder (including the consents of
all lessors of Leased Real Property) shall be paid and borne entirely by the
Company, and (B) if the lessor, master lessor, sublessor, or licensor under
any Lease conditions its grant of a consent (including by threatening to
exercise a "recapture" or other termination right) upon, or otherwise requires
in response to a notice or consent request regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the payment of a consent fee,
"profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including increased rent
payments), or the provision of additional security (including a guaranty), the
Company shall be solely responsible for making all such payments and
providing all such additional security.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
6.5(a)_, as soon as may be reasonably practicable following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter, unless (x) the filing party has not received from the other party
hereto any information regarding such other party required to be included in
any such filing, whereupon the filing party shall not be required to make any
such filing until such filing party receives the requisite information from
the other party hereto, or (y) the other party hereto is not prepared to make
the required corresponding filings with the same Governmental Authority (if
applicable), whereupon the filing party shall not be required to make
any such filing until the other party hereto is prepared to make the
requisite corresponding filing with the same Governmental Authority), each of
Parent and the Company shall file (i) with the Bureau of Competition of the
FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, and (ii) any comparable
pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign
Governmental Authority under the merger notification or control laws and
regulations of any applicable foreign jurisdiction, in each case as Parent
reasonably determines in good faith to be necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer
and the Merger). If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any such
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. Each of Parent and the Company shall
(i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of, and supply the
other with any information that may be required in order to effectuate, such
filings or responses to requests for additional information or documentary
material, (ii) promptly inform the  



 

-59-  other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from
any Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), except that written
communications may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Companys business, and (B) as necessary to preserve any
legal privilege, (iii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed
written or material oral communication with any such Governmental Authority
(which, at the request of either of the parties, shall be limited to outside
antitrust counsel only), (iv) not participate in any meeting with any such
Governmental Authority unless it consults with the other in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and (v) furnish the other with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental
Authority. Neither Parent nor the Company shall consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent
shall pay the filing fees in connection with any such filings that must be
made by any of the parties under this _Section 6.5(b)_.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
6.5(a)_, in the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Offer and the Merger).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the Company

apply to any press release or public statement made or proposed to be made by
the Company pursuant to _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ or any disclosure of
Parent or Merger Sub in response thereto or in connection therewith.

6.12 _Company Options; Restricted Stock_.

(a) Each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and that is not then vested and exercisable, shall become fully vested
and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. As of the Effective
Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive from
Parent or the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, a
lump sum cash payment (without interest), less applicable withholding Taxes,
equal to the product of (i) the excess if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration
over (B) the per share exercise price for such Company Option and (ii) the
total number of shares underlying such Company Option (giving effect to the  



 

-63-  acceleration of vesting contemplated by this Section 6.12(a)). The Company
shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company
Option (or former holder of a Company Option) or any participant in any
Company Option Plans shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital
stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any other equity interest
therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights). The Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company
Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may
be required to effect the foregoing.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted
Stock granted under any of the Company Option Plans or otherwise, which are
outstanding and subject to restriction as of the Effective Time, shall,
without any further action on the part of the holders of such Restricted
Stock, vest and the restrictions thereon shall lapse and each share
of Restricted Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash. The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof administering the Company Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as may be required to effect the foregoing.

(c) _Tax Withdrawal_. Payments under this Section 6.12 shall be subject

Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code)
as Parent, any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, unless Parent provides written notice
to the Company that such 401(k) plan(s) shall be terminated prior to the date
that the Company becomes a member of Parents control group of corporations
(as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code). The Company shall take any and all
other actions in furtherance of maintaining any such 401(k) Plans as Parent
may reasonably request.

(b) Prior to the Appointment Time, the Company shall terminate any and all
group severance or group separation plans, programs or arrangements maintained
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for (i) the existing
compensation agreements listed in _Section 6.13(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) any plans, programs or arrangements required by
Legal Requirements, effective in each case as of the day immediately preceding
the last day of the initial period of the Offer (not including any subsequent
offer period provided by Parent pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act).
Prior to the Appointment Time, the Company shall provide Parent evidence that
such plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board
or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and
substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Parent).

(c) For the twelve (12) month period commencing on the Appointment Time,
Parent shall permit and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to permit all  



 

-64-  Continuing Employees who become employees of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent to participate in the benefit programs of Parent or the Subsidiary.
Parent shall, and agrees to cause, the Surviving Corporation to maintain
compensation levels, including base salary, cash-based incentive
opportunities, retirement, health and welfare benefits, but not any stock
based benefits, for the Continuing Employees at the same levels that are, in
the aggregate, comparable to those in effect for similarly situated employees
of Parent or the Subsidiary. Without limiting the foregoing, for U.S.
Continuing Employees Only, Parent shall cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations
under any health or similar plan of Parent to be waived with respect to
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under
the corresponding plan in which Continuing Employees participated immediately
prior to the Appointment Time, and any deductibles paid by Continuing
Employees under any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries health plans in the
plan year in which the Appointment Time occurs shall be credited towards
deductibles under the health plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate arrangements with its insurance
carrier(s) to ensure such result. Except with respect to Continuing Employees
who have entered into employment agreements with the Company or its
Subsidiaries and as required by applicable Legal Requirements, Continuing
Employees shall be considered to be employed by Parent "at will" and nothing
shall be construed to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
to terminate the employment of any such Continuing Employee at any time. In
the U.S., Continuing Employees who become employees of Parent shall be given
credit for all service with the Company or its U.S. Subsidiaries solely for
purposes of determining their rate of vacation accrual under Parents
standard procedure, and for eligibility to participate in, and vesting of
benefits under, Parents 401(k) plan. Outside the U.S., Continuing Employees
who become employees of a Subsidiary of Parent shall be given credit for
service with the Company or its Subsidiaries solely as required by applicable
Legal Requirements.

(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to be obligated to
perform, in accordance with their terms, all contractual rights of current and
former employees of the Company existing as of the date of this Agreement and
disclosed in _Section 6.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as well
as any retention and severance agreements entered into pursuant to _Section
6.13(h)_, that are "change in control" agreements of the
Company (collectively, the " _Change in Control Agreements_ ").

(e) For purposes of the Change in Control Agreements disclosed in  _Section
6.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent acknowledges that the
Offer will constitute a "change in control" and a "change of control" of the
Company. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent acknowledges and agrees that
the executive officers and directors and, as applicable, employees of the
Company shall be entitled to the applicable payments and benefits as set forth
in such Change in Control Agreements, in accordance with the terms thereof as
disclosed in _Section 6.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.



 

-65- (f) The Company acknowledges and agrees to cause the accrual of all severance
payments under all of the Change in Control Agreements to occur prior to the
Appointment Time. The Company shall appropriately reflect such accruals in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
accordance with GAAP and will pay such amounts immediately prior to the
Appointment Time and as disclosed in _Section 6.13(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(g) Parent acknowledges and agrees that all bonus payments due to executives
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008,
will be payable pursuant to the terms of the cash bonus plan (as amended, the
" _Cash Bonus Plan_ ") and the bonus amounts disclosed on _Section 6.13(g)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company acknowledges and agrees that
the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries will
reflect appropriate accruals for the Cash Bonus Plan and any other employee
incentive plans providing employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with any bonus or awards determined based on the Companys performance during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, all of which such amounts are reflected
in _Section 6.13(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall not
enter into, implement, adopt, amend, modify or approve any cash bonus plan
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 or any other employee incentive plans
providing employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any bonus
or awards determined based on the Companys performance during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2009, without the written approval of Parents designee.

(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.2(g)_, Parent acknowledges
that the Company may enter into retention and severance agreements by and
between the Company and certain employees after the date of the this Agreement
and pursuant to the terms set forth in Section _6.13(h)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

6.14 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For six (6) years after the Appointment Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under their
respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) and all indemnification agreements in effect
immediately prior to the Appointment Time between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and
officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Appointment Time (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "). In addition, for a period of six (6) years following the
Appointment Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Appointment Time, and during such six
(6) year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed  



 

-66-  or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who were covered by such provisions, except as
required by Legal Requirements.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Appointment Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Appointment Time, covering
each person covered by the DandO Insurance immediately prior to the Appointment
Time, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable, in
the aggregate, than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at its
option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage
and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such persons than the DandO
Insurance, _provided further_ , however, that in satisfying its obligations
under this _Section 6.14(b)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred percent (200%)
of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
(such two hundred percent (200%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ")
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in
_Section 6.14_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), provided that that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior
to the Appointment Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy
(the " _Tail Policy_ ") on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance and for an amount not to
exceed $500,000. In the event that the Company does not purchase the Tail
Policy, Parent may purchase a Tail Policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the
event that either the Company or Parent shall purchase such a Tail Policy
prior to the Appointment Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section
6.14(b)_ for so long as such Tail Policy shall be maintained in full force and
effect.

(c) Prior to the Appointment Time, the Company shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under Delaware law and regardless of whether the Merger
becomes effective, indemnify and hold harmless, and, after the Appointment
Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Appointment Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted
under Delaware law, indemnify and hold harmless, the Indemnified Parties
against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts
paid in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Appointment Time), whether civil,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or
omission in their capacities as such, in each case occurring before the
Appointment Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of any such  



 

-67-  claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the Company or Parent
and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall be entitled
to control the defense of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, (ii) if the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or
counsel selected by the applicable insurer of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation) does not elect to control the defense of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
select counsel for the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company or to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, and the Company or Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
pay the fees and expenses of such counsel promptly after statements therefor
are received (unless the Company or Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall elect to defend such action), (iii) the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iv) none of the
Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for
any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section 6.14_.

(e) The obligations under this _Section 6.14_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.14(b)_ (and
their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.14(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to
in _Section 6.14(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.14_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy
referred to in  _Section 6.14(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives))
under this _Section 6.14_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights that such persons may have under the certificate or
articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Legal Requirements (whether
at law or in equity).

6.15 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.



 

-68- 6.16 _Insurance Policies_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to ensure that all of its current and legacy insurance policies are
available for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation, including with respect
any instances where an occurrence and/or claim takes place before the
Appointment Time and is not made known until after the Appointment Time.

6.17 _Rights Agreement; Consequences if Rights Triggered_. The Company Board
of Directors shall take all action requested in writing by Parent or Merger
Sub in order to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the Offer, the
Merger, the Tender and Voting Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as approved in writing by Parent, the
Company Board shall not (i) amend the Company Rights Plan, (ii) redeem the
Company Rights or (iii) take any action with respect to, or make any
determination under, the Company Rights Plan, in each case in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub. If any Distribution Date, Stock Acquisition
Date, Section 11(a)(ii) Event or Section 13 Event (each as defined in the
Company Rights Plan) occurs under the Company Rights Plan at any time during
the period from the date of this Agreement to the Appointment Time, the
Company and Parent shall make such adjustment to the Offer Price as the
Company and Parent shall mutually agree so as to preserve the economic
benefits that the Company and Parent each reasonably expected on the date of
this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger, the Tender and Voting Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.18 _Rule 16b-3 Actions_. Parent and the Company agree that, in order to
most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of the
Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) under
the Exchange Act in connection with the Offer and the Merger, both prior to
and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that such Persons not
be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section
6.18_. Promptly after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.
