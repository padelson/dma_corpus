      F.Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement, certain key employees of
the Company are entering into employment, non-competition and non-solicitation
agreements with Buyer in substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT C
(the "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS").

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and
other promises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the
performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the

parties hereby agree as follows (provided that the Escrow Agent is a party
hereto solely for purposes of Article VIII and Article X):

                                   ARTICLE I

                           PURCHASE AND SALE OF STOCK

      1.1 SALE OF STOCK. At the Closing (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement including without
limitation satisfaction of the conditions found in ARTICLE VII hereof, each of
the Selling Stockholders will sell, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer and
Buyer will purchase and acquire from each of the Selling Stockholders, good and
valid title to the shares of Company Capital Stock owned at the Closing by such
Selling Stockholders, free and clear of any Liens (other than Liens arising by
reason of restrictions on transfer under federal and state securities laws).

      1.2 CLOSING. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Company Capital
Stock and the transfer of title to the Company Capital Stock by the Selling
Stockholders to Buyer (the "CLOSING") will take place as promptly as
practicable, but no later than five (5) Business Days, following satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII hereof, at the offices of
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, 11921 Freedom Drive,
Suite 600, Reston, Virginia, 20190-5634, unless another place or time is agreed
to by Buyer, the Company and the Onex Stockholder Representative (such time, the
"EFFECTIVE TIME"). The date upon which the Closing actually occurs is herein
referred to as the "CLOSING DATE." At the Closing, the parties hereto shall
deliver the documents contemplated by ARTICLE VII hereof together with such
other customary documents as may be reasonably requested, and the Buyer shall
make the payments to the Selling Stockholders and the Surrendering Optionees as
set forth in Section 1.3(a).

      1.3 PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT. All cash payments made under this
Agreement shall be in United States dollars and shall be made by bank, certified
check or, at the option of a Selling Stockholder, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds for any payments in excess of $10,000.00, to an
account or accounts specified in writing to Buyer prior to the Closing Date by
the party entitled to receive such payment hereunder. "Cash," "$," and "dollars"
shall each mean United States dollars.

            (a) AMOUNT OF PAYMENT AT THE CLOSING. In consideration of the sale,
assignment and transfer of the Company Capital Stock and the agreements of the
Selling Stockholders and Surrendering Optionees made in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, at the Closing, Buyer shall pay to each
Selling Stockholder and Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee a cash amount equal to
the product of (x) such Selling Stockholder's or Surrendering Series A-1
Optionee's applicable Closing Consideration Percentage, multiplied by (y) the
total of (A) $12,500,000, plus (B) the Aggregate Paid-In Exercise Price, plus
(C) the aggregate Initial Series A-1 Exercise Prices for all Surrendering
Optionees referenced on Consideration Schedule A minus (D) the Closing Excess
Expenses, if any, and minus, (z) solely with respect to each Surrendering Series
A-1 Optionee, the amount of Initial Series A-1 Exercise Price for such
Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee referenced on Consideration Schedule A (the

CONSIDERATION").

                                                                             -2-
<PAGE>

            (b) AMOUNT OF PAYMENT AT ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING.
Subject to Section 1.3(c), in consideration of the sale, assignment and transfer
of the Company Capital Stock and the agreements of the Selling Stockholders and
Surrendering Optionees made in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, on the first Business Day after the one year anniversary of the Closing
(such date, the "ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY DATE"), Buyer shall pay to each Selling
Stockholder and Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee that amount equal to the
product of (x) such Selling Stockholder's or Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee's
applicable First Anniversary Consideration Percentage, multiplied by (y) the
total of (A) $15,500,000, plus (B) the aggregate Initial Series A-1 Exercise
Prices for all Surrendering Optionees referenced on Consideration Schedule B,
minus (C) any Excess Third Party Expenses and minus (D) solely with respect to
each Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee, the amount of Initial Series A-1 Exercise
Price for such Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee referenced on Consideration
Schedule B (collectively, the "FIRST ANNIVERSARY CONSIDERATION").
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.3(b) to the contrary, Buyer, in its
sole discretion, may pay all or any portion of the First Anniversary
Consideration to each Selling Stockholder and Surrendering Optionee in shares of
its Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "BUYER COMMON STOCK"), the
value of which shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of Buyer
Common Stock for the 15-trading day period immediately prior to the date of
issuance, as equitably adjusted for stock splits, combinations, dividends and
the like; provided, however, that Buyer shall not have the right to pay any
portion of the First Anniversary Consideration in shares of Buyer Common Stock
unless (i) such shares (A) have been duly authorized, (B) are validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and (C) are issued in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable federal and state securities laws and (ii) the
issuance of such shares does not and will not (1) violate any provision of the
Organizational Documents of Buyer or (2) result in a Conflict (as defined in
Section 2.5) of or under any material contract to which Buyer is a party or any
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable
to Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, except for such Conflicts as to which requisite waivers or consents have
been obtained; provided further that Buyer shall not have the right to pay any
of the First Anniversary Consideration in shares of Buyer Common Stock unless
(i) Buyer shall have provided written notice to each of the Stockholder
Representatives at least 30 days prior to the payment thereof of the aggregate
amount of such payment that will consist all or in part of shares of Buyer
Common Stock, (ii) the value of the Buyer Common Stock as determined pursuant to
this Section 1.3(b) shall not be less than $5.00 per share, as equitably
adjusted for stock splits, combinations, dividends and the like, and (iii) Buyer
shall have complied with the provisions set forth in Section 5.17(a) hereto
regarding registration of the Buyer Common Stock, to the extend applicable. Any
such distribution of Buyer Common Stock to the Selling Stockholders or the
Surrendering Optionees pursuant to this Section 1.3(b) shall be proportional
among all Selling Stockholders and Surrendering Optionees that are either
Accredited Investors or that will be receiving such shares of Buyer Common Stock
pursuant to Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act. Buyer shall pay
cash to those Selling Stockholders and Surrendering Optionees who are both (i)
not Accredited Investors and (ii) "U.S. Persons" as that term is defined in
Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act.

            (c) ESCROW. Buyer shall withhold in cash $1,250,000 of the First
Anniversary Consideration to be issued to the Indemnifying Stockholders (such
amount to be withheld based on the relative Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of each
Indemnifying Stockholder), and such cash shall be delivered

                                                                             -3-

to the Escrow Agent and held and distributed by the Escrow Agent on the terms
and conditions contained in ARTICLE VIII.

      1.4 CONTINGENT EARN-OUT PAYMENTS. Buyer shall pay to the Selling
Stockholders and Surrendering Optionees a payment (the "EARN-OUT PAYMENT"), if
any, at such time and under such conditions as the Earn-Out Payment is payable
in accordance with this Section 1.4 and in the aggregate amount (such amount,
the "EARN-OUT AMOUNT") of the lesser of (A) $55,000,000, and (B) (x) the Initial
Earn-Out Amount (defined below) less (y) the product of (i) the quotient
obtained by dividing the Initial Earn-Out Amount by $55,000,000, multiplied by
(ii) $750,000. The "INITIAL EARN-OUT AMOUNT" shall be (1) the product of seven
multiplied by the Trailing EBITDA, less (2) the amount of Excess Capital
Expenditures (as such terms are defined below), provided that if the resultant
amount of this clause (2) would otherwise be less than zero, then such amount
shall be zero.

            (a) TRAILING EBITDA. For the purposes of this Section 1.4, "TRAILING
EBITDA" shall be computed using the following formula, provided that if Trailing
EBITDA would otherwise be less than zero, then such amount shall be zero:

               (4/5 * ((1 * A) + (2 * B) + (2 * C))) - $3,600,000

            Where:

            A =   The Company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
                  and amortization for the three months ended September 30,
                  2004, as determined in accordance with GAAP and the
                  assumptions set forth in the Earn-Out Operating Parameters,
                  and subject to Sections 1.4(f) and 1.4(g).

            B =   The Company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
                  and amortization for the three months ended December 31, 2004,
                  as determined in accordance with GAAP and the assumptions set
                  forth in the Earn-Out Operating Parameters, and subject to
                  Sections 1.4(f) and 1.4(g).

            C =   The Company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
                  and amortization for the three months ended March 31, 2005, as
                  determined in accordance with GAAP and the assumptions set
                  forth in the Earn-Out Operating Parameters, and subject to
                  Sections 1.4(f) and 1.4(g).

            For the purposes of the determination of the Company's earnings in
A, B and C above, the selling, general and administrative expenses (the "SG&A
EXPENSES") and research and development expenses (the "R&D EXPENSES") shall be
the lower of (i) $1,193,401, $1,151,641, and $1,286,065 for SG&A Expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2004, December 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005,
respectively and $126,242, $125,282, and $123,687 for R&D Expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2004, December 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005,
respectively and (ii) the actual SG&A Expenses and R&D Expenses for the
referenced periods as determined in accordance with GAAP and the assumptions set
forth in the Earn-Out Operating Parameters, and subject to Sections 1.4(f) and
1.4(g).

                                                                             -4-
<PAGE>

            (b) EXCESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. For the purposes of this Section
1.4, "EXCESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES" shall be equal to (A) the amount of capital
expenditures incurred by the Company during the period beginning July 1, 2004
and ending March 31, 2005, as determined in accordance with GAAP, less (B) an
amount equal to (x) $4,000,000 plus (y) the amount, if any, by which capital
expenditures incurred by the Company during the period beginning April 1, 2004
and ending June 30, 2004, as determined in accordance with GAAP (subject to
Section 1.4(f) and 1.4(g)), are less than $2,516,000; provided that if the
Excess Capital Expenditures amount would otherwise be less than zero, then such
amount shall be zero.

            (c) PAYMENT IN BUYER COMMON STOCK. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer, in its sole discretion, may pay a portion or all of the Earn-Out Payment
in shares of Buyer Common Stock, the value of which shall be deemed to be the
average of the closing prices of Buyer Common Stock for the 15-trading day
period immediately prior to issuance, as equitably adjusted for stock splits,
combinations, dividends and the like; provided, however, that Buyer shall not
have the right to pay any portion of the Earn-Out Payment in shares of Buyer
Common Stock unless (i) such shares (A) have been duly authorized, (B) are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and (C) are issued in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable federal and state securities laws and
(ii) the issuance of such shares does not and will not (1) violate any provision
of the Organizational Documents of Buyer or (2) result in a Conflict of or under
any material contract to which Buyer is a party or any judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Buyer or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except for such
Conflicts as to which requisite waivers or consents have been obtained; provided
further that Buyer shall not have the right to pay any of the Earn-Out Payment
in shares of Buyer Common Stock unless (i) Buyer shall have provided written
notice to each of the Stockholder Representatives at least 30 days prior to the
payment thereof of the aggregate amount of such payment that will consist all or
in part of shares of Buyer Common Stock, (ii) the value of the Buyer Common
Stock as determined pursuant to this Section 1.4(c) shall not be less than $5.00
per share, as equitably adjusted for stock splits, combinations, dividends and
the like and (iii) Buyer shall have complied with the provisions set forth in
Section 5.17(b) regarding registration of Buyer Common Stock, to the extent
applicable. Any such distribution of Buyer Common Stock to the Selling
Stockholders or the Surrendering Optionees pursuant to this Section 1.4(c) shall
be proportional among all Selling Stockholders and Surrendering Optionees that
are either Accredited Investors or that will be receiving such shares of Buyer
Common Stock pursuant to Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act.
Buyer shall pay cash to those Selling Stockholders and Surrendering Optionees
who are both (i) not Accredited Investors and (ii) "U.S. Persons" as that term
is defined in Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act.

            (d) EARN-OUT DISTRIBUTION. Based on the Total Transaction Value to
be paid by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Earn-Out
Percentages used for distribution pursuant to this Section 1.4(d) refer to those
Earn-Out Percentages included on the applicable Consideration Schedule
referenced beside the Total Transaction Value ranges set forth below. The "TOTAL
TRANSACTION VALUE" shall be equal to the sum of (A) the Closing Consideration,
(B) the First Anniversary Consideration, and (C) the Earn-Out Amount. For
purposes of illustration only, if the Total Transaction Value equals
$65,000,000, then the Earn-Out Percentages on Consideration Schedule G would be
used to calculate the distribution of the Earn-Out Payment.

                                                                             -5-

      The Buyer will distribute the Earn-Out Payment, if any, in the following
preferential order:

                  (i) Prior to any other distribution of the Earn-Out Amount,
each Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee shall be entitled to receive, in addition
to the amounts provided for in Sections 1.4(d)(ii) and 1.4(d)(iv) below, if any,
an amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (x) the number of
Additional Surrendered A-1 Options for such Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee
referenced on the applicable Consideration Schedule, multiplied by (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (1) the Closing Consideration
plus (2) the First Anniversary Consideration, and the denominator of which is
the Aggregate Series A-1/A-2 Liquidation Amount, minus (B) the amount of
Additional Series A-1 Exercise Price for such Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee
referenced in the applicable Consideration Schedule (the aggregate amount
payable to all Surrendering Series A-1 Optionees under this clause (i) shall be
referred to herein as the "PREFERENTIAL OPTION CONSIDERATION"); provided that if
the resultant amount of the Preferential Option Consideration exceeds the
difference between the Earn-Out Amount minus the Investment Banking Fee, the
Preferential Option Consideration shall be reduced to the amount equal to the
Earn-Out Amount minus the Investment Banking Fee.

                  (ii) After distribution of the Preferential Option
Consideration, each Selling Stockholder and Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee
shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the amount provided for in Section
1.4(d)(iv) below, if any, an amount equal to the product of (A) such Selling
Stockholder's and Surrendering Series A-1 Optionee's applicable Series A-1/A-2
Earn-Out Percentage, multiplied by (B) the Earn-Out Amount, less the Investment
Banking Fee, less the Preferential Option Consideration, provided that if the
resultant amount of this clause (B) would otherwise be less than zero, then such
amount shall be zero (the aggregate amount payable to all Selling Stockholders
and Surrendering Series A-1 Optionees under this clause (ii) shall be referred
to herein as the "SERIES A-1/A-2 EARN-OUT PREFERENCE"); provided, however, in
the event that the Series A-1/A-2 Earn-Out Preference exceeds the Series A-1/A-2
Remaining Preference Amount (defined below), the Series

                                                                             -6-
<PAGE>

A-1/A-2 Earn-Out Preference shall be equal to the Series A-1/A-2 Remaining
Preference Amount. The "SERIES A-1/A-2 REMAINING PREFERENCE AMOUNT" shall be
equal to (A) the product of (x) the sum of the Aggregate Series A-1/A-2 Shares
plus the total number of Additional Surrendered A-1 Options as referenced on the
applicable Consideration Schedule, multiplied by (y) $1.00, less (B) the sum of
the Closing Consideration plus the First Anniversary Consideration.

                  (iii) After the distribution provided for in
Section 1.4(d)(ii), each Selling Stockholder and Surrendering Series A-3
Optionee shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the amount provided for in
Section 1.4(d)(iv) below, if any, an amount equal to (I) with respect to each
Selling Stockholder, the product of (A) such Selling Stockholder's applicable
Series A-3 Earn-Out Percentage, multiplied by (B) (x) the Earn-Out Amount less
the sum of (1) the Investment Banking Fee, (2) the Preferential Option
Consideration and (3) the Series A-1/A-2 Earn-Out Preference, provided that if
the resultant amount of this clause (B)(x) would otherwise be less than zero,
then such amount shall be zero (the resultant amount of this clause (B)(x) shall
be referred to herein as the "INTERIM EARN-OUT AMOUNT"), plus (y) the aggregate
Additional Series A-3 Exercise Prices for all Surrendering Series A-3 Optionees
referenced on the applicable Consideration Schedule, and (II) with respect to
each Surrendering Series A-3 Optionee, the difference between (A) the product of
(x) such Surrendering Series A-3 Optionee's applicable Series A-3 Earn-Out
Percentage, multiplied by (y) the Interim Earn-Out Amount plus the aggregate
Additional Series A-3 Exercise Prices for all Surrendering Series A-3 Optionees
referenced on the applicable Consideration Schedule, minus (B) the amount of
Additional Series A-3 Exercise Price for such Surrendering Series A-3 Optionee
referenced on the applicable Consideration Schedule; provided, however, in the
event that the Interim Earn-Out Amount exceeds the Series A-3 Preference Amount
(defined below), the Interim Earn-Out Amount shall be equal to the Series A-3
Preference Amount. The "SERIES A-3 PREFERENCE AMOUNT" shall be equal to the
product of (A) the sum of the Aggregate Series A-3 Shares plus the total number
of Surrendered A-3 Options as referenced on the applicable Consideration
Schedule, multiplied by (B) $1.00.

                  (iv) After the distribution provided for in
Section 1.4(d)(iii), each Selling Stockholder and Surrendering Optionee shall be
entitled to receive an amount equal to the product of (A) such Selling
Stockholder's and Surrendering Optionee's applicable Final Earn-Out Percentage,
multiplied by (B) the Earn-Out Amount less the sum of (w) the Investment Banking
Fee, (x) the Preferential Option Consideration, (y) the Series A-1/A-2 Earn-Out
Preference, and (z) the Interim Earn-Out Amount, provided that if the resultant
amount of this clause (B) would otherwise be less than zero, then such amount
shall be zero (the aggregate amount payable to all Selling Stockholders and
Surrendering Optionees under this clause (iv) shall be referred to herein as the
"FINAL EARN-OUT AMOUNT").

                  (v) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.4 to the
contrary, in no event shall Buyer be obligated to distribute in the aggregate
any amount in excess of the Earn-Out Amount less the Investment Banking Fee
pursuant to this Section 1.4.

            (e) EARN-OUT NOTICE. On the later to occur of (i) the One Year
Anniversary Date or (ii) twenty (20) Business Days after the date on which the
consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with
GAAP have been prepared as of and for the fiscal quarter ended

                                                                             -7-
<PAGE>

March 31, 2005, but in any event with respect to this clause (ii) on or before
July 31, 2005, Buyer shall deliver to the Onex Stockholder Representative a
memorandum (the "EARN-OUT NOTICE") specifying in reasonable detail the
calculation of the Earn-Out Amount, if any, and the calculation of the
distribution of the Earn-Out Amount to each of the Selling Stockholders and
Surrendering Optionees pursuant to Sections 1.4(d)(i), 1.4(d)(ii), 1.4(d)(iii)
and 1.4(d)(iv), with the basis for such calculation and any supporting
documentation, as applicable.

            (f) ONEX STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE OBJECTION. The Onex Stockholder
Representative shall have forty-five (45) days to make an objection (in writing)
to any item in the Earn-Out Notice, and such statement must be delivered to
Buyer prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the last day of such forty-five (45)
day period. The Onex Stockholder Representative may notify Buyer in writing at
any time prior to the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period that it does
not object to any item in the Earn-Out Notice, which notice shall trigger
payment by Buyer in accordance with Section 1.4(d). During such forty-five (45)
day period, Buyer shall provide the Onex Stockholder Representative and an
accounting firm of national standing and reputation selected by the Onex
Stockholder Representative (which firm shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Buyer), upon reasonable advance notice and during regular working hours, full
access to the books and records and the management of the Company to the extent
relevant for the purpose of review of the Earn-Out Notice and verification of
the calculations set forth therein. The cost of such review, including the
expenses of any accounting firm, shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Stockholders, who shall bear such costs based on their Indemnity Pro Rata
Portion, unless the results of such review, which shall have either been agreed
to by the Buyer or shall have been determined to be correct after application of
the arbitration provisions of Section 8.3(f)(iii) hereof, reveal that the
Buyer's calculation of the Earn Out Amount was inaccurate in the favor of Buyer
by more than 2.5% of the actual amount, in which case Buyer shall pay such costs
and expenses to the extent they are reasonable and documented in reasonable
detail. Any such costs of review borne by the Indemnifying Stockholders shall be
deducted from the Earn-Out Payment (to the extent thereof) prior to distribution
and paid by Buyer to the Onex Stockholder Representative, and, to the extent the
Onex Stockholder Representative has not previously advanced such amount to the
accounting firm providing such review (and/or other appropriate recipients
thereof), Onex shall remit such amount to such accounting firm (and/or other
appropriate recipients thereof); provided that the Onex Stockholder
Representative shall have first provided to Buyer an executed certificate
providing a detailed listing of such costs and attesting as to its accuracy. The
Onex Stockholder Representative and any accounting firm performing such review
shall be subject to non-disclosure obligations reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyer.

            (g) RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS.

                  (i) In case the Onex Stockholder Representative shall have
objected in writing to the Earn-Out Notice in a timely manner or in case of any
other dispute relating to the Earn-Out Amount, the Onex Stockholder
Representative and Buyer will attempt in good faith to resolve such objection or
dispute. Buyer shall promptly make payment of that portion (if any) of the
Earn-Out Amount not subject to such dispute and retain only the disputed portion
of the Earn-Out Amount until such dispute is resolved in accordance with this
Section 1.4(g). If the Onex Stockholder Representative and Buyer should so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement will be prepared and signed by

                                                                             -8-
<PAGE>

both parties, and any payments to be made as set forth therein shall be made on
the terms provided therein.

                  (ii) In the event the parties cannot come to an agreement as
set forth in Section 1.4(g)(i) within thirty (30) days after the date on which
the Onex Stockholder Representative objected in writing to the Earn-Out Notice
or, in the event the dispute does not relate to an Earn-Out Notice, the date on
which the parties determine that they are unable to reach agreement pursuant to

Company during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on March 31,
2005 (the "EARN-OUT PERIOD") shall be governed by the provisions set forth at
EXHIBIT D (the "EARN-OUT OPERATIONS PARAMETERS"). Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer agrees not to take any other action that would frustrate the
spirit of the transaction and the Earn-Out contemplated hereunder. Buyer
acknowledges that compliance with this Section 1.4(h) is intended to protect the
interests of the Selling Stockholders in maximizing the Earn-Out Amount. If
Buyer fails to comply with any of the provisions or the intent of the Earn-Out
Operations Parameters, or takes other actions to frustrate the spirit of the
transaction and the Earn-Out contemplated hereunder, the Selling Stockholders
shall have the right to pursue a claim in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement for Losses (which shall include, without limitation, any reduction in
the Earn-Out Amount which results, directly or indirectly, from such failure to
comply). Any disputes regarding this Section 1.4(h) (including any dispute
regarding whether Buyer has complied with the Earn-Out Operations Parameters)

            (i) TRANSFER LIMITATIONS. No Selling Stockholder may sell, exchange,
transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to receive any portion of

succession or by operation of law or (ii) if such Selling Stockholder or
Surrendering Optionee shall have furnished Buyer with an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer that such disposition will not require
registration of such portion of the Earn-Out Amount under the Securities Act,
and the attempted transfer in violation of this Section 1.4(i) shall be null and
void and shall not be recognized by Buyer. No Surrendering Optionee may sell,
exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to receive any
portion of the Earn-Out Amount other than by the laws of descent and
distribution or succession or by operation of law, and the attempted transfer in
violation of this Section 1.4(i) shall be null and void and shall not be

consideration would otherwise have been paid.

require.

of the Company to engage in any line of business or to compete with any Person.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth on Section
2.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not entered into any
agreement under which the Company is restricted from selling, licensing,
manufacturing or otherwise distributing any of its technology or products or

      2.12  TITLE TO PROPERTIES; ABSENCE OF LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES; CONDITION OF
EQUIPMENT; CUSTOMER INFORMATION.

            (a) The Company owns no real property, nor has the Company ever
owned any real property. Section 2.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a list of all real property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or
from the Company or otherwise used or occupied by the Company for the operation
of its business (the "LEASED REAL PROPERTY"), the name of the lessor, licensor,
sublessor, master lessor and/or lessee, the date and term of the lease, license,
sublease or other occupancy right and each amendment thereto and the aggregate
annual rental payable thereunder.

            (b) Section 2.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true, correct and complete list of all leases, lease guaranties, subleases,
agreements for the leasing, use or occupancy of, or otherwise granting a right
in or relating to the Leased Real Property, including all amendments,
terminations and modifications thereof ("LEASE AGREEMENTS"). All such Lease
Agreements are valid and effective with respect to the Company in accordance
with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any
existing default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) by the Company, or to the Knowledge of the Company, by the
other contracting party, and no rentals are past due.

            (c) Except as set forth on Section 2.12(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Leased Real Property is in good operating condition and
repair, free from material structural, physical and mechanical defects and is
structurally sufficient and otherwise suitable for the conduct of the business
as presently conducted. Neither the operation of the Company on the Leased Real
Property nor such Leased Real Property, including the improvements thereon,
violate in any material respect any applicable building code, zoning requirement
or statute relating to such property or operations thereon, and any such
non-violation is not dependent on so-called non-conforming use exceptions.

            (d) Except as set forth in Section 2.12(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company has good and valid title to, or, in the case of
leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its tangible
properties and assets, real, personal, immovable, movable and mixed, used or
held for use in its business, free and clear of any Liens, except (i) as
reflected in the Current Balance Sheet, (ii) Liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable, and (iii) such imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, which

Person with the intention by the Company to acquire ownership thereof, either
(i) such IP was developed or created by employees of the Company acting within
the scope of their employment or (ii) the Company has obtained a valid and
enforceable assignment sufficient to irrevocably transfer all rights in and to
all such IP to the Company. To the maximum extent provided for by, and in
accordance with, applicable laws and regulations, the Company has recorded each
such assignment of a Registered Intellectual Property Right assigned to the
Company with the relevant Governmental Entity, and no third party owns or has
any rights to any such IP.

            (n) To the extent that any IP has been developed or created by a
third party for the Company or is incorporated into, or used to provide, any of
the Company Services and such IP was not developed or created with the intention
by the Company to acquire ownership thereof, the Company has a written agreement
with such third party with respect thereto and the Company thereby has obtained
a perpetual, non-terminable license (sufficient for the conduct of its business
as currently conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted) to all such
third party's IP, and in each case such rights and licenses shall survive the
Acquisition and be fully exercisable by the Company following the Acquisition.

            (o) Except as set forth in Section 2.13(o) of the Company Disclosure

Company Intellectual Property or is incorporated into or used to provide any
Company Service.

            (q) Except as set forth in Section 2.13(q) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no government funding, facilities of a university, college, other
educational institution or research center or funding from third parties was
used in the development of any Company IP. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
current or former employee, consultant or independent contractor of Company, who
was involved in, or who contributed to, the creation or development of any
Company IP, has performed services for the government, university, college, or
other educational institution or research center during a period of time during
which such employee, consultant or independent contractor was also performing
services for Company.

                                                                            -38-

conducted, or is currently contemplated to be conducted, by the Company,
including but not limited to the design, development, use, import, branding,

Services, does not infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Right of
any Person, violate any right of any Person (including any right to privacy or
publicity), or constitute unfair competition or unfair trade practices under the
laws of any jurisdiction, and the Company has not received written notice (and
the Company Officer Group has not received oral notice) from any Person claiming
that such operation or any act, product, technology or service (including
Company Services and products, technology or services currently under
development) of the Company infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual
Property Right of any Person or constitutes unfair competition or trade
practices under the laws of any jurisdiction (nor does the Company have
Knowledge of any basis therefor).

            (s) No Company IP or Company Service is subject to any proceeding or
outstanding decree, order, judgment or settlement agreement or stipulation that

Agreements other than (i) Off-the-Shelf Licenses and (ii) the Company's standard

the IP Agreements and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no other party to any
such IP Agreement is in breach thereof or has failed to perform thereunder.
Except as set forth in Section 2.13(t) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will neither violate nor result in
the breach, modification, cancellation, termination or suspension of any IP
Agreements or entitle the other party or parties to such IP Agreements to
terminate such IP Agreements. Except as set forth in Section 2.13(t) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, following the Closing Date, the Company will be
permitted to exercise all of Company's rights under the IP Agreements to the
same extent Company would have been able to had the Acquisition not occurred and
without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than
ongoing fees, royalties or payments which Company would otherwise be required to
pay. The Acquisition will not result in any third party being granted any rights

currently has under such IP Agreements.

to the infringement or misappropriation by the Company or such other Person of
the Intellectual Property Rights of any Person other than the Company.

            (x) The Company has taken all steps that are reasonably required to
protect the Company's rights in confidential information and trade secrets of
the Company and the confidential information and trade secrets of any other
Person which were provided to the Company pursuant to an appropriate
nondisclosure agreement or with respect to which the Company had a duty to
protect the confidentiality under applicable law. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company has and enforces a policy requiring each technical
employee of the Company to execute a proprietary rights and confidentiality
agreement substantially in the form set forth in Section 2.13(x) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, all current employees who have created or modified any of
the Company Intellectual Property have executed such an agreement, and all
former employees and consultants of the Company who have created or modified any
of the Company Intellectual Property have executed a similar agreement, in each
case assigning all of such employees' and consultants' rights in and to the
Company Intellectual Property to the Company.

            (y) Neither this Agreement nor the Contemplated Transactions,
including the assignment, by operation of law or otherwise (by virtue of the

is a party, will result in (i) the Company's granting to any third party any
right to or with respect to any IP owned by, or licensed to, it, (ii) the
Company's being bound by, or subject to, any non-compete or other restriction on
the operation or scope of its business, or (iii) the Company's being obligated

conducted nor any activity of such officers, directors, current employees or
consultants in connection with the carrying on of the Company's business or any
ERISA Affiliate's businesses as presently conducted or currently proposed to be
conducted will, to the Knowledge of the Company, conflict with or result in a
material breach of the terms, conditions, or provisions of, or constitute a

payments are due, will be paid if incurred prior to the Closing Date), and the

thereafter acquired by the Company consisted of items of a quantity and quality

the Company has continued to replenish inventories in a normal and customary

connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Related
Agreements to which such Selling Stockholder is a party or the consummation or
performance of any of its obligations in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions.

            (a) There is no pending Proceeding that has been commenced by or
against the Selling Stockholder that (i) relates to the business of, or any of

to review with its own Tax and legal advisors the Tax and legal consequences to

The Selling Stockholder understands that he, she or it must rely solely on his,
her or its advisors and not on any statements or representations (other than the
Buyer's representations and warranties in this Agreement) by the Buyer or any of
its agents. The Selling Stockholder further understands that he, she or it (and
not the Buyer or any representative of the Buyer) shall be responsible for his,
her or its own Tax liability that may arise as a result of the Acquisition or
the Contemplated Transactions.

                                                                            -50-

      3.5 INVESTMENT INTENT.

            (a) The Selling Stockholder understands that if any Registrable
Securities are to be issued as Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, (i)
such shares have not been registered under the Securities Act, nor qualified
under the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, (ii) such shares cannot be
resold unless they subsequently are registered under the Securities Act and
qualified under applicable state securities laws or foreign securities laws,
unless exemptions from such registration and qualification requirements are
available, (iii) such Selling Stockholder has no right to require such
registration or qualification except in accordance with the provisions of
Section 5.17 hereof and (iv) the certificates representing such unregistered
shares of Buyer Common Stock shall bear the legends as set forth in Section
5.17(k) hereof.

            (b) The Selling Stockholder understands that Buyer's reliance on an
exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act is based
in part on the Selling Stockholder's representations set forth in this
Agreement.

            (c) Any Registrable Securities received by the Selling Stockholder,
if any, will be acquired for such Selling Stockholder's own account and not with
a view to, or intention of, distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act, any applicable state securities laws or foreign securities laws, and the
Selling Stockholder will not dispose of the shares of such Registrable
Securities in contravention of the Securities Act or any applicable state
securities laws or foreign securities laws.

            (d) In the event such Selling Stockholder is eligible to receive
Registrable Securities hereunder, such Selling Stockholder is either:

                  (i) an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act; or

                  (ii) not a "U.S. Person" as that term is defined in Regulation
S promulgated under the Securities Act ("REGULATION S") and has a legal
residence outside the United States.

            (e) Prior to the Closing, the Selling Stockholder will provide Buyer
with such information concerning any prior investment experience, business or
professional experience and other information as Buyer may reasonably deem
necessary to further evaluate the foregoing representations, including a
customary investor questionnaire with reasonably acceptable answers thereon, as
to such Selling Stockholder's investor status.

the risks of, and other considerations relating to, an investment in Buyer
Common Stock.

            (g) The Selling Stockholder is able to bear the economic risk of its
investment in Buyer Common Stock for an indefinite period of time. The Selling
Stockholder understands that the Registrable Securities to be issued pursuant to
this Agreement, if at all, have not been registered under the Securities Act
and, therefore, cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the
Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available.

                                                                            -51-

Selling Stockholder as listed on Section 2.2(a) and Section 2.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule are true and correct in all material respects, and

purpose of determining the applicability of any state, local or foreign
securities laws.

outside the United States and is not a "U.S. Person" as that term is defined in
Regulation S or an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D of the Securities Act, such Selling Stockholder represents and
warrants that he or it is not acquiring the Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant
to the Acquisition for the account or benefit of a U.S. Person. ARTICLE IV

of this Agreement and the Related Agreements (to the extent the Buyer is a party
thereto), and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, does not and
will not (i) violate any provision of the Organizational Documents of the Buyer,
or (ii) result in a Conflict of or under any material contract to which the

or regulation applicable to Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, except for such Conflicts as to which requisite

                                                                            -53-
<PAGE>

      4.7 BUYER REPORTS. The Buyer has made available to the Company all forms,
reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since December 31,
2001, and has on a timely basis filed all such forms, reports and documents

(other than items for which confidential treatment has been granted) on the
SEC's web site through the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval
System ("EDGAR") two (2) days prior to the date of this Agreement, the Buyer has
made available to the Company in the form filed with the SEC (a) the Buyer
Reports and (b) all comment letters with respect to which the SEC has not
ultimately acknowledged an adequate response. The Buyer Reports (i) were or will
be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and (ii) when read together, do not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

sheets, statements of income, cash flow and stockholders' equity included in or
incorporated by reference into the Buyer Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) is true and correct in all material respects, has been prepared
in accordance with GAAP throughout the periods indicated and consistent with
each other, except, in the case of unaudited statements, to the extent permitted
by Regulation S-X for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and fairly presents the
consolidated financial condition, operating results and cash flows of Buyer and
its subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will
not be material in amount or effect). There are no material amendments or
modifications to agreements, documents, financial statements or other documents
which previously have been filed with the SEC by Buyer pursuant to the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, that have not yet been filed with the SEC but are or will be
required to be filed by Buyer.

      4.9 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as set forth in any Buyer
Report and except with respect to the Contemplated Transactions, from December
31, 2003 through the date of this Agreement, there has not been any Buyer
Material Adverse Effect or any event or condition that could reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

      4.10 LITIGATION. Except as set forth in any Buyer Report, there is no
Proceeding pending, or to the Knowledge of the Buyer, threatened, against the

to the Buyer's Knowledge, any of their officers or directors in their respective
capacities as such that challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or
materially delay any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Buyer Reports, at the time they were filed with the SEC, included the disclosure
required by applicable law with respect to Proceedings against the Buyer and its
subsidiaries, their properties (tangible or intangible) and Proceedings against
any of their officers or directors in their respective capacities. Since June
30, 2004, (i) no known Proceeding has been commenced or, to Buyer's knowledge,
threatened, against the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, their properties
(tangible or intangible), or, to the Buyer's Knowledge, any of their officers or
directors in their respective capacity as such that would be required to be
disclosed in a Form 10-K, 10-Q or 8-K that would reasonably be expected to have
a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, and (i) there has been no

                                                                            -54-
<PAGE>

adverse development in any Proceeding disclosed in any Buyer Reports that would
reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

      4.11 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Buyer has complied with, is not in violation
of, and has not received any notices of violation with respect to, any Legal
Requirements, except where the failure to so comply is not reasonably likely to
result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

      4.12 COMMISSIONS AND FEES. Neither the Buyer nor any of its subsidiaries
has incurred, nor will it incur, directly or indirectly, any liability for
brokerage or finders' fees or agents' commissions, fees related to investment

the Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby.

            (a) The Company shall prepare, with the review and approval of
Buyer, an information statement (the "INFORMATION STATEMENT") which shall
constitute a disclosure document to be sent to the holders of Company Capital
Stock and Company Options in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and
mail the Information Statement in accordance with the terms hereof on or before
July 21, 2004 and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
the Company in its efforts to prepare and mail the Information Statement by July

            (b) Each of Buyer and the Company agrees to provide promptly to the
other such information concerning its business and financial statements and

or appropriate under applicable law for inclusion in the Information Statement,
or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and
auditors to cooperate with the other's counsel and auditors in preparation of
the Information Statement. Anything to the contrary contained herein
notwithstanding, the Company shall not include in Information Statement any
information with respect to Buyer or its affiliates or associates, the form and
content of which shall not have been approved by Buyer prior to such inclusion;
provided, however, that Buyer covenants to provide information with respect to
Buyer and its affiliates and associates to the extent necessary to ensure the
Company's compliance with Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act. The Company
shall cause the Information Statement to comply with Regulation 14E under the
Exchange Act, and the process by which Company shall solicit the holders of
Company Capital Stock and Company Options in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall comply with Regulation 14E under the
Exchange Act; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect or limit
the binding nature of this Agreement by and among the parties who have executed
and delivered it as of the date hereof.

            (c) As promptly as practical after the date any Buyer Common Stock
is issued pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall prepare and make such filings
as are required under applicable blue sky

                                                                            -55-

as may be necessary to comply with the securities and blue sky laws relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      5.2 RESERVED.

      5.3 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Upon reasonable advance notice, and during
regular working hours, the Company shall afford Buyer and its accountants,
counsel and other representatives, reasonable access during the period from the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time to (i) all of the properties, books,
contracts, written commitments and records of the Company, (ii) all other
information concerning the business, properties and personnel (subject to
restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the Company as Buyer may reasonably
request, and (iii) all employees of the Company as identified by Buyer; provided
that such access shall not create an unreasonable disruption to the conduct of
the Company's business. The Company agrees to provide to Buyer and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of internal financial
statements (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) promptly upon
request. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.3 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties to consummate the Acquisition in accordance with the terms and
provisions hereof.

      5.4 REQUIRED APPROVALS AND EXEMPTIONS; REASONABLE EFFORTS. As promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Parties will make all filings
required by Legal Requirements to be made by them in order to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions. Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to take promptly, or cause to be taken (including actions after the Closing) all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the Contemplated Transactions, to obtain all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings and
to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in
order to consummate and make effective the Contemplated Transactions for the
purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to agree to any
divestiture by the Buyer or the Company or any of Buyer's other Subsidiaries or
affiliates, of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of
Buyer or its Subsidiaries or affiliates, or of the Company, its affiliates, or
the imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.
Each party hereto, at the request of another party hereto, shall execute and
deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as
may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the
Acquisition and the Contemplated Transactions.

      5.5 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the
information obtained in any investigation pursuant to the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement or the effectuation of the Contemplated Transactions
shall be governed by the terms of the Confidential Information Agreement dated
as of May 13, 2004 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT") between the Company and
Buyer. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Selling Stockholders
agree that, except with the prior

                                                                            -56-
<PAGE>

written permission of the Buyer, they shall at all times hold in confidence and
trust and not use or disclose any confidential information of (x) the Company
provided to or learned by them prior to the Closing or provided to them by Buyer
or the Company after the Closing or (y) Buyer provided to or learned by it in
connection with the due diligence process in connection with Contemplated
Transactions and the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the confidentiality restrictions of
this Section 5.5 shall not apply to information that (i) was in the public
domain at the time it was disclosed or has entered the public domain through no
fault of the receiving party, (ii) is disclosed pursuant to the order or
requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other Governmental Entity;
provided, however, that the receiving party shall provide prompt notice of such
court order or requirement to the disclosing party to enable the disclosing
party to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such
disclosure, (iii) with respect to information described in clause (y) above, was
known by the receiving party at the time it is disclosed, (iv) is subsequently
lawfully disclosed to the receiving party by a third party not bound by
obligations of confidentiality or (v) is used by a Selling Stockholder who is an
employee of the Company or Buyer in the performance of services for the Company
after the Closing.

      5.6 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Except to the extent required by Applicable Legal
Requirements, no party shall issue any statement or communication to any third
party (other than their respective agents) regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, if applicable, the
termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor, without the consent of
the other parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided,
however, that this restriction shall not prevent any party from making any
disclosure that is necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws or
regulations; and provided, further, that this restriction shall not prevent
Buyer, the Company or Onex American Holdings II LLC (or Onex Corporation) from
issuing a press release after the execution of this Agreement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby provided such press
release has been approved by the other parties referenced in this proviso
(excluding Onex Corporation), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

      5.7 EXPENSES. Whether or not the Acquisition is consummated, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition including, without
limitation, all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other
fees and expenses of third parties incurred by a party in connection with the
negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions ("THIRD PARTY EXPENSES"), shall be the obligation
of the respective party incurring such fees and expenses. The Company shall pay
its Third Party Expenses prior to Closing to the extent possible, and to the
extent not possible, shall properly accrue any such Third Party Expenses on its
books and records. If the amount of actual and anticipated Third Party Expenses
listed on Section 2.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule updated as of the
Closing with the Company's then current reasonable estimate of all Third Party
Expenses actually incurred and expected to be incurred by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(which updated amount the Company shall provide in writing to Buyer prior as of
Closing) exceeds $1,250,000 (the "EXPENSE CAP"), the amount of such excess (such
amount, the "CLOSING EXCESS EXPENSES") shall reduce the Closing Consideration.
If it is determined after the Closing, in accordance with the provisions of
Article VIII, that the Third Party Expenses of the Company exceed the Expense
Cap or exceed the

                                                                            -57-
<PAGE>

Expense Cap in an amount greater than as determined at Closing, the amount of
such excess not already reduced from the Consideration shall, notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, be withheld by Buyer from and
shall reduce the amount of First Anniversary Consideration. Such amount,
exclusive of the Closing Excess Expenses, is referred to as the "EXCESS THIRD
PARTY EXPENSES".

      5.8 TERMINATION OF BENEFIT PLANS. Effective prior to the Closing (such
date, the "TERMINATION DATE"), the Company and ERISA Affiliates, as applicable,
shall each terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary
continuation, programs or arrangements (unless Buyer provides written notice to
the Company at least five days prior to the Closing that such plans shall not be
terminated) (collectively, "COMPANY DEFERRAL PLANS"). Unless Buyer provides such
written notice to the Company, the Company shall provide Buyer at the Closing
with evidence that such Company Deferral Plan(s) have been terminated (effective
as of the Termination Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company's or its
ERISA Affiliates (as may be applicable) Board of Directors. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to prior review and approval of
Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company and its
Subsidiaries also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating
such Company Employee Plan(s) as Buyer may reasonably require.

      5.9 RELEASE OF LIENS. The Company shall file, or shall have filed, all
agreements, instruments, certificates and other documents, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, that are necessary or appropriate to effect
the release of all Liens set forth in Schedule 5.9 to this Agreement.

      5.10 DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Each party hereto shall deliver
or make available to the other parties any information that such party may
reasonably request, including but not limited to, in the case of the Company and
Buyer, audited financial statements on a consolidated basis, in order to
effectuate filings, notices, petitions or statements required by any
Governmental Body in connection with the Acquisition and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, any filings required under
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any rules and regulations of the SEC.

      5.11 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Each of the Company and the Buyer
shall give prompt notice to the other of: (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would reasonably be
expected to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or Buyer, as the
case may be, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior
to the Closing, and (ii) any failure of the Company or Buyer, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall not (a) limit or otherwise
affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice or (b)
constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement. Without
limiting the provisions of Section 8.5(h), no disclosure by the Company or Buyer
as the case may be pursuant to this Section 5.11, however, shall be deemed to
amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any
misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant.

      5.12 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS AND FURTHER ASSURANCES. If, at any time after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall reasonably determine that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances or other documents or instruments or any other
acts or things are reasonably necessary or proper (a) to vest,

                                                                            -58-
<PAGE>

perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in Buyer, its right to, and title or
interest in, the Company Capital Stock transferred by the Selling Stockholders
or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall so
advise the Onex Stockholder Representative and the Non-Onex Stockholder
Representative in writing, and the Selling Stockholders thereupon shall execute
and deliver all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and other
documents and instruments and do all such other acts and things reasonably
necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm Buyer's right, title
or interest in, to or under the Company Capital Stock transferred by the Selling
Stockholders, and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Buyer
shall, at the request of any of the other parties hereto, execute and deliver
such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be
necessary or proper for effecting completely the consummation of the Acquisition
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

      5.13 SECTION 338 ELECTION.

            (a) The Company and the Selling Stockholders are hereby notified
that Buyer reserves the right to make an election under Section 338(g) of the
Code with respect to the purchase of the Company Capital Stock provided that the
requirements under Section 338(g) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder are otherwise satisfied.

            (b) Buyer and the Company agree that the Consideration paid by Buyer
and the liabilities of the Company, along with any other relevant items, will be
allocated to the assets of Company for all purposes (including U.S. income tax
and U.S. GAAP purposes) in a manner consistent with the provisions under
Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

            (c) Buyer and the Company shall file all required U.S. and non-U.S.

            (a) Except to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirement,
Buyer agrees that for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, it shall not,
and shall not permit the Company to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in
the Company's Organizational Documents relating to exculpation or
indemnification of present or former officers and directors of the Company (or
any indemnification or similar agreement in effect between the Company and any
such officer or director without the written consent of such officer or
director), it being the intent of the parties that the officers and directors of
the Company prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification and to the benefit of any such agreement to the
fullest extent permitted under the law of the Company's jurisdiction of
incorporation and other applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 5.14 shall be construed to limit the ability of the
Company to merge or consolidate with or sell all or substantially all of its
assets to another entity; provided, that in the event of a merger or
consolidation, the surviving entity shall honor the indemnity obligations of the
Company.

                                                                            -59-
<PAGE>

            (b) The Company shall maintain, and Buyer shall cause the Company to
maintain, at no additional expense to Buyer or the Company, the officers' and
directors' liability insurance policies in effect as of the date of this
Agreement for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, with respect to
actions and omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date, on terms which are at
least as favorable, including at least the same coverage, as the terms of such
insurance policies in effect on the date hereof. The expense of such policies
shall be borne by the Company and shall be deemed a Third Party Expense
hereunder.

      5.15 CERTAIN ACTIONS BY BUYER. Buyer shall not cause the Company to merge
with another entity, regardless of whether the Company or such other entity
survives such merger, until the first business day following the Closing Date.

      5.16 280G APPROVAL(a) . As soon as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall submit to the Stockholders for
approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Buyer), by such number of
Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code,
any payments and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate, constitute
"parachute payments," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code
("SECTION 280G PAYMENTS") (which initial determination shall be made by the
Company and shall be subject to review and approval by Buyer, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), such that such Section 280G Payments shall not be deemed
to be Section 280G Payments, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall
deliver to Buyer certification that (A) a Stockholder vote was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and the requisite Stockholder approval was obtained with respect to
any Section 280G Payments that were subject to the Stockholder vote, or (B) that
the Stockholder approval of Section 280G Payments was not obtained and as a
consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to
the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments,
pursuant to the waivers of those payments and/or benefits duly executed by the
affected individuals prior to the Stockholder vote.

      5.17 REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS; RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER.

            (a) FIRST ANNIVERSARY SHARES.

                  (i) If Buyer elects pursuant to Section 1.3(b) hereof to issue

(y) Buyer elects pursuant to Section 1.4(c) hereof to issue Buyer Common Stock
as part of the Earn-Out Payment (collectively with the First Anniversary Shares,
the "REGISTRABLE SECURITIES"), then as soon as practicable after the date such
shares become issuable (and in no event more than five (5) Business Days
thereafter), Buyer shall have registered all of the shares of Buyer Common Stock
with the SEC on the Registration Statement as to permit each holder of
Registrable Securities (the "HOLDERS") to resell such shares of Buyer Common
Stock.

                  (ii) If the registration of which Buyer under this clause (b)
gives notice is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting,
Buyer shall so advise the Holders. In such event, the right of any Holder to
registration pursuant to clause (b) shall be conditioned upon such Holder's
participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of Registrable Securities
in the underwriting shall be limited to the extent provided herein. All Holders
proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall
(together with Buyer and the other holders distributing their securities through
such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with
the managing underwriter selected for such underwriting by Buyer. If any Holder
disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such person may elect to
withdraw therefrom by written notice to Buyer.

            (c) In the case of each registration effected by Buyer pursuant to
this Section 5.17(a) or (b), Buyer will keep each Holder advised in writing as
to the initiation of such registration and as to the completion thereof. Buyer
will:

                  (i) Prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement (or
amendment thereto) with respect to such securities and use its reasonable
efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and remain effective from
the later of (i) the date on which Registrable Securities are first included
therein and (ii) the date the Registrable Securities are issued for at least 180
days or, if earlier, until the distribution described in the Registration
Statement has been completed;

                  (ii) Furnish to the Holders participating in such registration
and to the underwriters of the securities being registered such reasonable
number of copies of the Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus and such other documents as such persons may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the public offering of such securities;

                  (iii) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection
with such Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration
Statement;

                                                                            -61-
<PAGE>

                  (iv) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to register and
qualify the securities covered by such Registration Statement under such other
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably
requested by the Holders, provided that Buyer shall not be required in
connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to
file a general consent to service of process in any such states or
jurisdictions;

                  (v) Promptly notify each Holder of Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement at any time when a prospectus relating
thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of
any event as a result which the prospectus included in such Registration
Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then
made;

                  (vi) Cause all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to
this Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or market on which
similar securities issued by Buyer are then listed;

                  (vii) On or before the effective date of the Registration
Statement, furnish to Buyer's transfer agent unlegended certificates
representing ownership of the Registrable Securities being sold; and

                  (viii) Make available, at the cost of the Holders (except for
attorneys' fees and disbursements which are Registration Expenses) and during
normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice, for inspection by the
Holders and their attorneys and accountants, all financial and other records and
other information, pertinent corporate documents and properties of Buyer and its
subsidiaries, as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the Holders to exercise
their due diligence responsibilities; provided however, that any such records
and other information disclosed by Buyer pursuant to this clause (viii) shall be
subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 5.5.

            (d) Subject to paragraph (e) below, in the event (i) of any request
by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority during the
period of effectiveness of the Registration Statement for amendments or
supplements to such Registration Statement or related prospectus or for
additional information; (ii) of the issuance by the SEC or any other federal or
state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose;
(iii) of the receipt by Buyer of any notification with respect to the suspension
of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose; (iv) of any event or circumstance not otherwise
covered by clause (v) below which, upon the advice of its counsel, necessitates
the making of any changes in a Registration Statement or prospectus, or any
document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, so that
they will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading; or (v) Buyer determines in good faith that
offers and sales pursuant to a Registration Statement should not be made by
reason of the presence of material undisclosed circumstances or developments
with respect to which the disclosure would be required in such a Registration
Statement or related prospectus, is reasonably likely to have a seriously

                                                                            -62-
<PAGE>

detrimental effect on Buyer, then Buyer shall deliver a certificate in writing
to the Holders (the "SUSPENSION NOTICE") to the effect of the foregoing and,
upon receipt of such Suspension Notice, the Holders shall refrain from selling
any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement (a
"SUSPENSION") until the Holders have received copies of a supplemented or
amended prospectus prepared and filed by Buyer, or until they are advised in
writing by Buyer that the current prospectus may be used, and have received
copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed
incorporated by reference in any such prospectus. In the event of any
Suspension, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the use of
the prospectus so suspended to be resumed as soon as reasonably practicable
after the delivery of a Suspension Notice to the Holders.

            (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Suspension shall continue
for more than 90 days, and (ii) Buyer shall not deliver more than two Suspension
Notices under clause (v) of Section 5.17(d) in any twelve-month period.

            (f) Provided that a Suspension is not then in effect, each
Stockholder may sell Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement,
provided, to the extent required by applicable law, that it arranges for
delivery of a current prospectus to the transferee of such securities. Upon
receipt of a reasonable request therefor, Buyer shall provide an adequate number
of current prospectuses to the Stockholder Representatives.

            (g) EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION. All Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with all registrations pursuant to Section 5.17 shall be borne by
Buyer. All Selling Expenses relating to securities registered on behalf of the
Holders and all other registration expenses shall be borne by the Holders on a
pro rata basis based on the number of Registrable Securities included in the
registration. Any fees and disbursements of one counsel for the selling
Holder(s) selected by them by majority vote, in excess of $35,000, shall be
borne by the Holders on a pro rata basis, based on the number of Registrable
Securities included in the registration.

            (h) INFORMATION. Each Holder shall furnish to Buyer such information
regarding such Holder, the shares of Buyer Common Stock held by them and the
distribution proposed by such Holder as Buyer may reasonably request in writing
and as shall be required in connection with any registration referred to in this
Agreement.

            (i) INDEMNIFICATION. In the event any shares of Buyer Common Stock
are included in a Registration Statement under this Section 5.17:

                  (i) To the extent permitted by law, Buyer will indemnify and
hold harmless each Holder, its officers and directors, any underwriter (as
defined in the Securities Act) for such Holder and each person, if any, who
controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities (joint or
several), costs (including, without limitation, costs of investigation,
preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees) and expenses (collectively,
"REGISTRATION LOSSES") to which they may become subject under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such
Registration Losses arise out of or are based upon any of the following
statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "VIOLATION"): (i) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such
Registration

                                                                            -63-
<PAGE>

Statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained
therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation
or alleged violation by Buyer of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state
securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act or any state securities law; provided, however, that the
indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (i) (i) shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any such Registration Loss if such settlement is
effected without the consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), nor shall Buyer be liable in any such case for any such Registration
Loss to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which
occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
expressly for use in connection with such registration by or on behalf of any
such Holder.


                  (ii) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder
(severally and not jointly) will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, each of its
directors, each of its officers who has signed the Registration Statement, each
person, if any, who controls Buyer within the meaning of the Securities Act, any
underwriter, any other Holder selling securities in such Registration Statement
and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other Holder, against any
Registration Losses to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject,
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Securities Act or other federal or state
law, insofar as such Registration Losses arise out of or are based upon any
Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such
Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished by such Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration;
provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (i)
(ii) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent
of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that,
in no event shall the aggregate liability of any Holder pursuant to this
subsection (i) (ii) and Section 5.17(i)(iv) exceed the net proceeds from the
offering received by such Holder, except in the case of willful fraud by such
Holder.

                  (iii) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
this subsection (e) of notice of the commencement of any action (including any
governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof
is to be made against any indemnifying party under this subsection (e) deliver
to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the
indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent
the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually
satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party
(together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without
conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel,
with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if
representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the
indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such
counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the
indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such
action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the
indemnified party under this subsection (i) except to the extent such failure is
prejudicial to the indemnifying party's ability to defend such action and the
omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve
it of any liability that it

                                                                            -64-
<PAGE>

may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this subsection (i). The
indemnifying party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of any
rights of any person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against
the indemnified party, and (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages
that are paid in full by the indemnifying party.

                  (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this subsection
(i) is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an
indemnified party with respect to any Registration Loss referred to therein,
then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party
hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
party as a result of such Registration Loss in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of
the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or
omissions that resulted in such Registration Loss as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations; provided, that, in no event shall the aggregate
liability of any Holder under this subsection (i)(iv), and Section 5.17(i)(ii)
exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder, except in the
case of willful fraud by such Holder. The relative fault of the indemnifying
party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the
provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting
agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are
in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting
agreement shall control. The obligations of Buyer and Holders under this
subsection (i) shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable
Securities in a Registration Statement under this Section 5.17, and otherwise.

            (j) RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY. Unless covered by an effective
Registration Statement, the Buyer Common Stock and any other securities issued
in respect of such stock upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
merger, or similar event, shall not be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged
except upon the conditions specified in this Agreement, which conditions are
intended to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act. Each
Holder will cause any proposed purchaser, assignee, transferee, or pledgee of
any such shares held by the Holder or transferor to agree to take and hold such
securities subject to the restrictions and upon the conditions specified in this
Agreement.

            (k) RESTRICTIVE LEGEND. Each certificate representing the
Registrable Securities, or any other securities issued in respect of such stock
upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, or similar
event, shall (unless otherwise permitted by the provisions of subsection (l)
below) be stamped or otherwise imprinted with legends in substantially the
following form (in addition to any legends required by agreement or by
applicable state securities laws):

      THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
      SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"). SUCH SECURITIES MAY NOT BE
      TRANSFERRED UNLESS A REGISTRATION

                                                                            -65-
<PAGE>

      STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT IS IN EFFECT AS TO SUCH TRANSFER OR IN THE OPINION
      OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY, SUCH TRANSFER MAY BE MADE PURSUANT TO RULE
      144, AND, IF APPLICABLE, RULE 145 OR REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT IS
      OTHERWISE UNNECESSARY IN ORDER FOR SUCH TRANSFER TO COMPLY WITH THE ACT.

      Each Holder consents to Buyer making a notation on its records and giving
stop transfer instructions to any transfer agent of its capital stock in order
to implement the restrictions on transfer established in this Agreement.

            (l) NOTICE OF PROPOSED TRANSFERS. No sale, assignment, transfer or
pledge of Registrable Securities shall be made by any holder thereof to any
person unless such person shall first agree in writing to be bound by the
restrictions of this Agreement. Prior to any proposed sale, assignment, transfer
or pledge of any Registrable Securities, unless there is in effect a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act covering the proposed transfer,
the holder thereof shall give written notice to Buyer of such holder's intention
to effect such transfer, sale, assignment or pledge. Each such notice shall
describe the manner and circumstances of the proposed transfer, sale, assignment
or pledge in sufficient detail, and, if requested by Buyer, the holder shall
also provide, at such holder's expense, either (i) a written opinion of legal
counsel who shall be, and whose legal opinion shall be, reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer addressed to Buyer, to the effect that the proposed transfer of the
Registrable Securities may be effected without registration under the Securities
Act, or (ii) a "no action" letter from the SEC to the effect that the transfer
of such securities without registration will not result in a recommendation by
the staff of the SEC that action be taken with respect thereto, whereupon the
holder of such Registrable Securities shall be entitled to transfer such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of the notice delivered by
the holder to Buyer. Each certificate evidencing the Registrable Securities
transferred as above provided shall bear the appropriate restrictive legend set
forth in subsection (k) above, except that such certificate shall not bear such
restrictive legend if in the opinion of counsel for such holder reasonably
acceptable to Buyer such legend is not required in order to establish compliance
with any provision of the Securities Act.

            (m) CURRENT PUBLIC INFORMATION. Buyer covenants that it will file
any reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and Exchange Act
so as to enable Holders holding Buyer Common Stock issued to them hereunder to
sell such Buyer Common Stock without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rules 144, 144A and 145
under the Securities Act, as each may be amended from time to time, or (b) any
similar rule or rules hereafter adopted by the SEC, so long as the exemptions
provided for in such Rules would otherwise be available to such Holders at such
time. Upon the request of any such Holder, Buyer shall promptly deliver to such
Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the remedy of a
Holder for any breach of this paragraph (m) shall be limited to the dollar
amount of the Buyer Common Stock that could not be sold or which a Holder was
delayed in selling as a result of such breach valued as of the dates and
according to the procedures set forth in Article 1 with respect to such shares
of Buyer Common Stock, and (ii) no Holder may issue an Officer's Certificate or
otherwise assert a breach or make a claim with respect to this paragraph (m)
unless such Holder delivers written notice of such breach or claim to Buyer

                                                                            -66-
<PAGE>

within thirty (30) days after the date such Holder was first unable to sell its
shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant the exemptions provided by Rules 144, 144A
and 145 under the Securities Act, as each may be amended from time to time, as a
result of a breach of this paragraph (m).

      5.18 DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Commencing with the first fiscal
month (or portion thereof) of the Company after the Closing and terminating with
the last completed month of the Company occurring prior to the date the Earn-Out
Notice is delivered, Buyer shall deliver to each Stockholder Representative as
soon as practicable, but in any event within 20 days after the end of each such
month, the following financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(which shall be consolidated for the Company and its Subsidiaries only and shall
not include the consolidated results of Buyer): an unaudited statement of
operations for such month and an unaudited balance sheet as of the end of such
month. Each Stockholder Representative shall hold in confidence and trust such
financial statements and the information contained therein according to the
confidentiality provisions of Section 5.5 hereof.

      5.19 PAYMENT OF INVESTMENT BANKING FEE. Concurrent with the payment of the
Earn-Out Amount pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.4 hereof, Buyer agrees
to pay a cash amount equal to the Investment Banking Fee directly to Bear,
Stearns & Co. Inc. in accordance with instructions provided to Buyer by Bear,
Stearns & Co., Inc. Such Investment Banking Fee shall reduce the amount of the
Earn-Out Amount Buyer is obligated to pay hereunder on a dollar for dollar
basis.

Indemnified Parties and the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be referred to
herein collectively as the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES".

      8.3 ESCROW ARRANGEMENTS; CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION.

            (a) INDEMNITY ESCROW FUND. As security for the indemnity obligations
provided for in Section 8.2(a) hereof, on the date of the payment of the First
Anniversary Consideration, Buyer will deposit with the Escrow Agent such portion
of the First Anniversary Consideration as set forth in Section 1.3(c), such
amount to be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in this Article VIII. Any funds deposited by the
Buyer with the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 8.3, together with any
interest earned thereon from investments under Section 8.3(b)(iv) hereof, shall
be referred to herein as the "INDEMNITY ESCROW FUND." Except as expressly
provided in this Article VIII, the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be the sole and
exclusive source to compensate the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any claims by
such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are
entitled to recovery under this ARTICLE VIII. The Escrow Agent may execute this
Agreement following the date hereof but prior to the Closing, and such

                                                                            -78-

subsequent execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the
binding nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof between the other
signatories hereto.

            (b) INDEMNITY ESCROW PERIOD; DISTRIBUTION UPON TERMINATION OF
INDEMNITY ESCROW PERIODS.

                  (i) INDEMNITY ESCROW. Subject to the following requirements,
the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be in existence during the period (the
"INDEMNITY ESCROW PERIOD") commencing upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (A) 5:00
p.m., local time at Buyer's headquarters, on the date thirty (30) days after the
Survival Date (as such date is certified in writing by the Buyer to the Escrow
Agent), and (B) the date when the last portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund then
held by the Escrow Agent is distributed in accordance with this Section 8.3
(such date, the "INDEMNITY ESCROW TERMINATION DATE"). Upon the Indemnity Escrow
Termination Date the Escrow Agent shall immediately distribute to the
Indemnifying Stockholders the full remaining amount of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, less (i) any Disputed Amounts, (ii) any amounts necessary to satisfy
claims for Losses that have been previously resolved pursuant to Section 8.3(f),
and (iii) the amount of all other Losses for which Buyer has delivered an
Officer's Certificate prior to the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date with
respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Indemnity Escrow
Termination Date but which are not yet resolved pursuant to Section 8.3. As soon
as all such pending claims have been resolved in accordance with this Section
8.3, the Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver the remaining portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, to the Indemnifying Stockholders. Deliveries of
amounts out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Stockholders
pursuant to this Section 8.3(b)(i) shall be made in proportion to their
respective Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of the remaining Indemnity Escrow Fund.

                  (ii) WITHHOLDING. The Indemnifying Stockholders and the Buyer
agree to provide the Escrow Agent with properly executed Forms W-9 (or Forms
W-8, in the case of non-U.S. persons) prior to the date on which the first
distribution out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund is made hereunder. The parties
hereto understand that, in the event properly executed Forms W-9 (Forms W-8 in
the case of non-U.S. persons) are not provided to the Escrow Agent, the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended from time to time, may require withholding of a portion
of any distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

                  (iii) TAX OWNERSHIP. For any and all income Tax purposes the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and any and all investment income or earnings (including
realized capital gains) with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, until
distributed pursuant to the terms hereof, shall be the property of Buyer and
shall be reported as such for all Tax purposes (and, therefore, Buyer shall be
liable for and shall pay all income taxes imposed on such investment income).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, within 30 calendar days
of the end of each calendar quarter (or as soon as reasonably practical
thereafter after taking into account the maturity dates of any applicable
investments) and upon the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Agent
shall make a cash distribution to Buyer of 40% of the investment income
attributable to the preceding calendar quarter (or portion thereof). All
remaining investment income shall become part of the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

                                                                            -79-
<PAGE>

                  (iv) INVESTMENT. The Escrow Agent shall invest and reinvest
any or all of the Indemnity Escrow Fund as directed in writing by the Buyer, the
Onex Stockholder Representative and the Non-Onex Stockholder Representative
Committee, in any of the following:

                        (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the United
      States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof;

                        (ii) certificates of deposit or interest-bearing
      accounts of national banks or corporations endowed with trust powers
      having capital and surplus in excess of One Hundred Million Dollars
      ($100,000,000) (including Escrow Agent);

                        (iii) commercial paper at the time of investment rated
      A-1+ or better by Standard & Poor's Corporation or P-1 or better by
      Moody's Investor's Service, Inc.;

                        (iv) repurchase agreements with any bank or corporation
      described in clause (ii) fully secured by obligations described in clause
      (i); and

                        (v) shares of a money market fund investing only in
      short-term U.S. Treasury obligations or obligations backed by short-term
      U.S. Treasury obligations.

      If the Escrow Agent does not receive investment direction from the Buyer,
the Onex Stockholder Representative and the Non-Onex Stockholder Representative
Committee with respect to any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Escrow
Agent shall invest and reinvest the Indemnity Escrow Fund in the Escrow Agent's
Money Market Insured Savings Account.

            (c) PROTECTION OF INDEMNITY ESCROW FUND. The Escrow Agent shall hold
and safeguard the Indemnity Escrow Fund during the Indemnity Escrow Period, and
shall hold and dispose of the Indemnity Escrow Fund only in accordance with the
terms of this ARTICLE VIII.

            (d) CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (i) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before
the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date of an Officer's Certificate (as defined
below) from Buyer, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of this
Section 8.3, deliver to Buyer, as promptly as practicable, funds held in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund equal to the Losses specified in such Officer's
Certificate (to the extent available). Upon receipt by Buyer at any time on or
before the Survival Date of an Officer's Certificate from the Onex Stockholder
Representative or the Non-Onex Stockholder Representative Committee, Buyer
shall, subject to the provisions of this Section 8.3, deliver to the notifying
Stockholder Representative, as promptly as practicable, cash equal to the Losses
specified in such Officer's Certificate. At the time of delivery of any
Officer's Certificate by Buyer to the Escrow Agent, Buyer shall deliver a
duplicate copy of such Officer's Certificate to each of the Onex Stockholder
Representative and the members of the Non-Onex Stockholder Representative
Committee. At the time of delivery of any Officer's Certificate by a Stockholder
Representative to Buyer, such Stockholder Representative shall deliver a
duplicate copy of such Officer's Certificate to such other Stockholder
Representative (or Stockholder Representative Committee, as appropriate). For
the purposes hereof,

                                                                            -80-
<PAGE>

"OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE" shall mean a certificate signed by a duly authorized
officer(s) of the applicable Indemnified Party (1) stating that an Indemnified
Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or reasonably
anticipates in good faith that it will have to pay, sustain, incur, or accrue
Losses, and (2) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses
included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, sustained,
incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and
the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant, as
applicable, to which such Loss is related.

                  (ii) If either the Onex Stockholder Representative or the
Non-Onex Stockholder Representative Committee, as applicable, fails to object in
writing within the 30-day period after delivery by Buyer of an Officer's
Certificate to such Stockholder Representative, such failure to so object shall
be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the non-objecting Stockholder Representative
and the Indemnifying Stockholders represented by such Stockholder Representative
that the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to the full amount of the claim
for Losses set forth in such Officer's Certificate allocable to such
Indemnifying Stockholders. If Buyer does not object in writing within the 30-day
period after delivery by the Onex Stockholder Representative or the Non-Onex
Stockholder Representative Committee, as applicable, of an Officer's Certificate
to Buyer, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgement by
Buyer that the applicable Stockholder Indemnified Parties are entitled to the
full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Officer's Certificate.

                  (iii) In the event that a distribution from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund is made to Buyer on account of any such misrepresentation or breach
by a Selling Stockholder for which it is severally liable as provided above, the
applicable Selling Stockholder shall at the time of such distribution repay to
the Indemnifying Stockholders (other than itself if it is an Indemnifying
Stockholder) the amount of such distribution, with such payment to be
distributed among the other Indemnifying Stockholders on a pro rata basis based
on their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Portions (without taking into account the
Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of the paying Selling Stockholder).

                  (IV) TAX INDEMNIFICATION. The parties hereto agree, jointly
and severally, to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from any
liability or obligations on account of taxes, assessments, additions for late
payment, interest, penalties, expenses and other governmental charges that may
be assessed or asserted against the Escrow Agent in connection with or relating
to any payment made or other activities performed under the terms of this
Agreement (other than taxes assessed against the income of the Escrow Agent
derived from its fees), including without limitation any liability for the
withholding or deduction of (or failure to withhold or deduct) the same, and any
liability for failure to obtain proper certifications or to report properly to
governmental authorities in connection with this Agreement, including costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses), interest and penalties.
The foregoing indemnification and agreement to hold harmless shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

            (e) OBJECTIONS TO CLAIMS.

                  (i) For a period of thirty (30) days after delivery of an
Officer's Certificate to the Onex Stockholder Representative, the members of the
Non-Onex Stockholder Representative Committee and Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent
shall not distribute any portion of the Indemnity

                                                                            -81-
<PAGE>

Escrow Fund unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization
from the Onex Stockholder Representative and the Non-Onex Stockholder
Representative Committee to make such distribution. After the expiration of such
thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall deliver cash from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund equal to the amount of Losses claimed in such Officer's Certificate,
provided that no such payment or delivery may be made if either Stockholder
Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made in such
Officer's Certificate (an "OBJECTION NOTICE"), and such Objection Notice shall
have been delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty
(30) day period. The amount objected to by a Stockholder Representative in an
Objection Notice is referred to as a "DISPUTED AMOUNT."

                  (ii) If Buyer objects to the claim made in any Officer's
Certificate delivered by either the Onex Stockholder Representative or the
Non-Onex Stockholder Representative Committee (as the case may be), it shall
deliver a written statement of such objection (a "BUYER OBJECTION NOTICE") to
the applicable Stockholder Representative within thirty (30) days after receipt
of such Officer's Certificate by Buyer. Buyer shall not be obligated to deliver
payment in respect of such Losses allocable to the Indemnifying Stockholders
represented by such notifying Stockholder Representative until resolution of
such disputed claim in accordance with Section 8.3(f) below.

            (f) RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS; ARBITRATION.

                  (i) In case either the Onex Stockholder Representative or the
Non-Onex Stockholder Representative Committee delivers an Objection Notice or
Buyer delivers a Buyer Objection Notice, the objecting Stockholder
Representative(s) and Buyer shall attempt in good faith, for a period of at
least thirty (30) days, to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims and the amount of Losses. If the Stockholder
Representative(s) and Buyer should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a
claim against the Indemnity Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent.
The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall make
distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
thereof.

                  (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation and after thirty (30) days from the date of the delivery of an
Objection Notice or a Buyer Objection Notice, either Buyer or the applicable
Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration of the matter unless the
amount of the Loss is at issue in a pending Third Party Claim, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until either such amount is finally
determined pursuant to a final, non-appealable order, judgment or decree (as
certified in writing to the Escrow Agent by the applicable party), or both
parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by binding arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually selected by
Buyer and such Stockholder Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30)
days after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Buyer and such Stockholder
Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen
(15) days after the end of such thirty (30) day period, Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative shall each select one neutral arbitrator. The two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third neutral arbitrator. If either such
Stockholder Representative or the Buyer fails to select an arbitrator during
this fifteen (15) day period,

                                                                            -82-
<PAGE>

then the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by the one neutral
arbitrator selected by the other party.

                  (iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in New York City, New
York, under the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association. All reasonable fees and expenses relating to the
arbitration, including, without limitation, the respective expenses of each
party (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of
investigation), the fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the
American Arbitration Association shall be borne by the non-prevailing party, as
determined by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may
be, shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce
the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity,
adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the
opposing parties solely to the extent related to the subject matter of the
dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may
be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the
authority to impose sanctions to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, determine that discovery was sought without reasonable
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without reasonable
justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim in
such Officer's Certificate shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement and shall not be appealable. Such decision shall be
written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which
shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the
arbitrator(s). In case of a claim by Buyer against the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make distributions from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of such award, judgment,
decree or order, as applicable. Within thirty (30) days of a decision of the
arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party (or, in case
of a claim by Buyer against the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent) shall
make the payment to such other party in accordance with the terms of this
ARTICLE VIII.

                  (iv) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The foregoing arbitration provision
shall apply to any dispute among the parties under this ARTICLE VIII or Section
1.4, whether relating to claims upon the Indemnity Escrow Fund or to the other
indemnification obligations set forth in this ARTICLE VIII or disputes relating
to the Earn-Out Payment.

            (g) THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS.

                  (i) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice
of the commencement of a third party claim (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM") against it,
such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
against an indemnifying party under this ARTICLE VIII, give written notice to
the indemnifying party and, in case of a claim against the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, the Escrow Agent, of the commencement thereof, but the failure to so
notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any liability that it may
have to any Indemnified Party except to the extent the indemnifying party
demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced thereby. In case any
such Third Party Claim shall be brought against an Indemnified Party and it
shall give notice to the

                                                                            -83-
<PAGE>

indemnifying party (and the Escrow Agent, if applicable) of the commencement
thereof, then the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein
and, to the extent that it shall wish (unless (i) an indemnifying party is also
a party to such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party reasonably
concludes, based on the advice of counsel, that joint representation would
create a conflict of interest, (ii) the Third Party Claim asserts infringement
of intellectual property rights) to assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party and, after notice from such
indemnifying party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the
defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Party under this ARTICLE VIII for any fees of other counsel or any other
expenses with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim, in each case,
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof unless the indemnifying party shall have failed, after notice by the
Indemnified Party to the indemnifying party, to defend such claim. An
Indemnified Party shall, at its own expense (except as provided for in the
preceding sentence), have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
action or claim and to participate in, but not control, the defense thereof. If
an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, (A) no
compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by the indemnifying party
without the Indemnified Party's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld),
unless (1) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any
violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may
be made against the Indemnified Party and (2) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party and (B) the
indemnifying party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement thereof effected without its consent. If notice is given to an
indemnifying party of the commencement of any Third Party Claim and it does not,
within thirty (30) Business Days after the Indemnified Party's notice is
provided, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the
defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall only be bound by any determination
made in such Third Party Claim or any compromise or settlement thereof effected
by the Indemnified Party if consented to by the indemnifying party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), subject in any such case to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.5. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
8.3(g) to the contrary, in no event may any Selling Stockholder (other than a
Stockholder Representative) participate in or assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim as an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 8.3(g); instead,
the right to so participate in or assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
pursuant to this Section 8.3(g) shall belong to the Stockholder
Representative(s) representing such Selling Stockholder(s).

            (h) ESCROW AGENT'S DUTIES.

                  (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the
performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this ARTICLE VIII,
and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow
Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement which are signed by a duly
authorized officer of Buyer and the Onex Stockholder Representative and the
Non-Onex Stockholder Representative Committee which are not inconsistent with
the terms of this ARTICLE VIII, and may rely and shall be protected in relying
or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent
while acting in good faith, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice
of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.

                                                                            -84-
<PAGE>

                  (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to
disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any
other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby
expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any
court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment
or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the
parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance,
notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed,
modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without
jurisdiction.

                  (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on
account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or
delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents
or papers deposited or called for hereunder.

                  (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration
of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or
any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

                  (v) The Escrow Agent's duties hereunder are ministerial, and
shall not be construed as fiduciary, and in no event shall the Escrow Agent be
liable for indirect, punitive, or consequential damages, including damages
arising from a loss arising from the liquidation of investments to pay a claim
hereunder. In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall
not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except as a result
of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to
act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit
provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe
to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries,
fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority.
In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with
performing the Escrow Agent's duties under this Agreement and shall be fully
protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in
accordance with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for
determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to
act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.

                  (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this
Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this
Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to
determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent
may hold all documents and the Indemnity Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement
of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means
as, in the Escrow Agent's discretion, may be required, subject to the terms of
this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages.
Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader
requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among
themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the
court all documents and the Indemnity Escrow Fund held in escrow. All costs,
expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due
to the interpleader action (the "AGENT INTERPLEADER EXPENSES") shall be paid by
the parties as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Buyer and fifty
percent (50%) to be paid out of (and only to the extent

                                                                            -93-
<PAGE>

of) the Indemnity Escrow Fund, with any shortfall due to the Indemnity Escrow
Fund being exhausted paid for by Buyer. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow
Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and
liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

                  (vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns
agree to indemnify (as provided herein) and hold the Escrow Agent harmless
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses,
including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated
costs of in-house counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on the Escrow
Agent or incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of
his/her duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation
arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those
arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent
(the "AGENT INDEMNIFICATION EXPENSES") as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be
paid by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) to be paid out of (and only to the extent
of) the Indemnity Escrow Fund, with any shortfall due to the Indemnity Escrow
Fund being exhausted paid for by Buyer. This section shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

                  (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at
least thirty (30) days written notice to the Buyer, the Onex Stockholder
Representative and the members of the Non-Onex Stockholder Representative
Committee; provided, however, that no such resignation shall become effective
until the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as
follows: Buyer, the Onex Stockholder Representative and the Non-Onex Stockholder
Representative Committee shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a
successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If
the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the
Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized
to do business in the State of New York or, failing that, to apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent. The successor escrow
agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it
shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights,
powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as
escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent
shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.

            (i) FEES. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
hereunder shall be paid by Buyer in accordance with the standard fee schedule of
the Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon
for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary
services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of
this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any
service not provided for in this Agreement but that has been requested by an

counsel retained by such Stockholder Representative. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of any Stockholder Representative, including but not limited to an

Selling Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent and Buyer may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of any Stockholder Representative as being

      8.5 DEDUCTIBLE; MAXIMUM PAYMENTS; REMEDY.

            (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
except as set forth in the last sentence of this Section 8.5(a), an Indemnified
Party may not recover any Losses under Sections 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) unless and
until the aggregate amount of Losses specified in one or more Officer's
Certificates exceeds $400,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), in which case the
Indemnified Party shall be indemnified only to the extent that the aggregate
amount of such Losses exceed the Threshold Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for, and the
Threshold Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or
payments made with respect to (i) Losses involving any intentional
misrepresentations or fraud or (ii) Excess Amounts. The treatment of Excess
Third Party expenses shall be as set forth in Section 5.7 hereof, and shall not
be subject to any of the limitations set forth in this Section 8.5.

            (b) Except as set forth in Sections 8.5(d) and 8.5(e) hereof, the
maximum amount of Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties may recover from any
Indemnifying Stockholder pursuant to this Article VIII shall be limited to the
lesser of (i) such Indemnifying Stockholder's Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of such
Losses and (ii) such Indemnifying Stockholder's Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of
the sum of (A) the Indemnity Escrow Fund plus (B) an additional $1,250,000 (the
"GENERAL CAP AMOUNT"); provided, however, that (x) if the Earn-Out Payment is
made, with respect to claims related to the Pre-Closing Operation Indemnity, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties may seek to recover from each Indemnifying Stockholder
up to an additional amount (above the General Cap Amount) up to the lesser of
(i) such Indemnifying Stockholder's Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of such Losses
and (ii) such Indemnifying Stockholder's Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of the
product of (xx) $5,000,000 multiplied by (yy) the quotient of (AA) the Earn-Out
Amount divided by (BB) $55,000,000 and (y) with respect to claims (1) resulting
from the breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty contained in
Section 2.2 (Company Capital Structure), Section 2.10 (Tax Matters), or Article
III hereof, and (2) for Excess Amounts, the Buyer Indemnified Parties may seek
to recover from such Indemnifying Stockholder an additional amount in excess of
the General Cap Amount up to the lesser of (i) such Indemnifying Stockholder's
Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of such Losses and (ii) the aggregate amount of
Consideration actually received by such Indemnifying Stockholder (the "MAXIMUM
CAP AMOUNT"). Except as set forth in this Section 8.5(b), Section 8.5(d) and
8.5(f) hereof, upon distribution by the Escrow Agent of all of the
then-remaining Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 8.3 hereof, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not have any further right to recover from any
Indemnifying Stockholder.

            (c) Except as set forth in Section 8.5(f) hereof, the maximum amount
of Losses a Stockholder Indemnified Party may recover from Buyer pursuant to
this ARTICLE VIII shall be limited to the aggregate value of the Consideration
paid by Buyer to the related Selling Stockholder hereunder (and the maximum
aggregate amount all Stockholder Indemnified Parties may recover from Buyer
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII shall be limited to the aggregate value of the
Consideration paid by Buyer to all Selling Stockholders) with the value of any
shares of Buyer Common Stock to be determined as of the dates and according to
the procedures set forth in Article 1 with respect to such shares of Buyer
Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Indemnified Parties
may recover Losses arising, directly or indirectly, as a result of a breach or
violation by Buyer of the covenants

                                                                            -98-
<PAGE>

contained in Section 1.4(h) above, up to an aggregate amount equal to
$55,000,000 multiplied by the aggregate Earn-Out Percentage reflected on the
applicable Consideration Schedule applicable to all Selling Stockholders and
Surrendering Optionees.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
except as set forth in Section 8.5(f) hereof, the maximum amount of Losses that
the Buyer Indemnified Parties may recover from any Selling Stockholder pursuant
to this ARTICLE VIII for breach by such Selling Stockholder of any of its
representations and warranties set forth in ARTICLE III hereof shall be limited
to the total amount of Consideration paid to such Selling Stockholder hereunder
(and the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall not be the exclusive remedy). The value of
shares of Buyer Common Stock received by any such Selling Stockholder, if any,
shall be valued as of the dates and according to the procedures set forth in
Article 1 with respect to such shares of Buyer Common Stock. With respect to
Losses arising out of the breach of representations and warranties made by a
Selling Stockholder or in any covenant or other agreement made by such Selling
Stockholder, the liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this ARTICLE
VIII shall be the several liability of the applicable Selling Stockholder who
made such misrepresentation or breached such warranty, representation, covenant
or other agreement, and the other Selling Stockholders shall have no liability
in respect thereof.

            (e) Subject to the limitations provided in this Section 8.5, Buyer
may, at its election, set off any amounts of the Earn-Out Payment for any
amounts finally determined in accordance with the provisions of this Article
VIII to the extent not otherwise paid to Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or
from any Selling Stockholder. In no event shall this provision modify the timing
of payment obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section 1.4.

            (f) Any Losses a Buyer Indemnified Party may recover from any
Indemnifying Stockholder or any Selling Stockholder shall first be paid out of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of any party
(and the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall not be the exclusive remedy) in respect of
Losses arising out of any fraud or any willful breaches of representations and
warranties or covenants on the part of such party.

            (g) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided
under this ARTICLE VIII shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds related
thereto actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates.

            (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this Article VIII,
Buyer will not be able to recover Losses for breaches disclosed in the officer's
certificate delivered by the Company at Closing pursuant to Section 7.2(e) if,
notwithstanding such breaches, Buyer agrees to perform the Closing.

                                                                            -99-

the Company shall be binding upon and effective against such Selling
Stockholders whether or not they have signed such amendment; provided, however,
that any amendment that adversely affects any Selling Stockholder in a manner
differently than other Selling Stockholders shall require the consent of such
affected Selling Stockholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may
be amended prior to the Closing solely for the purpose of adding additional
Selling Stockholders and/or Surrendering Optionees as signatories and parties
hereto without the consent of any of the other parties hereto, and EXHIBIT A and
EXHIBIT B shall be appropriately updated for such additional Selling
Stockholders and/or Surrendering Optionees.

      9.2 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on the one

agree that any extension or waiver signed by both the Onex Stockholder
Representative and the Non-Onex Stockholder Representative Committee shall be

have signed such extension or waiver.

breached in any material respect (with materiality being measured individually
and on an aggregate basis taking into account all breaches of all covenants,

Company's representations and warranties that is waived by Buyer or that is
