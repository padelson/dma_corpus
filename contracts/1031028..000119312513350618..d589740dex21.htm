ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

Section 2.01. _The Merger_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary will merge (the " _Merger_ ")
with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Subsidiary will cease, and the Company will be
the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 



11 (b) Subject to the provisions of _Article 9_ , the closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. EDT in New York City at the
offices of Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP, 1177 Avenue of the Americas,
New York, New York 10036 two Business Days after the date the conditions
set forth in _Article 9_ (other than conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied
or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on
such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree in writing. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_."

(c) At the Closing, the Company will file a certificate of merger with the
Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required
by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger will become
effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as the certificate of
merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later
time as may be agreed upon by the parties hereto and specified in the
certificate of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.02(b)_ and  _Section 2.05_,
each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be converted into the right to receive $14.15 in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), without interest. As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Stock will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, no longer be outstanding and will cease to
exist, and Certificates therefor will thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration paid in accordance with _Section 2.03_,
without interest, and the holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Stock
will cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Stock other than
the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.08_) or Uncertificated
Shares in accordance with  _Section 2.03_, the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, for each such share of Company Stock held by them.

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent or any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be canceled, and no payment will be made with
respect thereto.

(c) The aggregate number of shares of common stock of Merger
Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into and become that number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation equal to the aggregate number of shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with the same rights,
powers and preferences as the shares so converted and will constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



12 Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares
of Company Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). As of or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will deposit with, or cause to be deposited with, the
Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to
_Section 2.02_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than three
Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent will send, or will cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock as of the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal (which will be in customary form and
subject to the review and reasonable approval of the Company prior to the
Effective Time) and instructions (which will specify that the delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration will be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "
_agent Â’s message_" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate
or Uncertificated Share will represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest will
be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share.

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it will be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share is properly transferred and
(ii) the Person requesting such payment pays to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company will be closed and, after the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they will be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this  _Article 2_.

 



13 (e) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Stock nine months after the Effective Time will
be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
_Section 2.03_ prior to that time may thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will not be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority will become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent,
upon demand.

(g) The Surviving Corporation will pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation will
also pay all transfer or other Taxes required to be paid as a result of the
surrender of Certificates or the transfer of Uncertificated Shares in exchange
for the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise provided by _Section
2.03(c)_.

 

Section 2.04. _Stock Options and Restricted Shares_.

(a) Each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock under any
Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested (a " _Company Stock Option_
") will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the
holder thereof will, subject to _Section 2.07_, be entitled to receive, from
the Surviving Corporation (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay to such holder), an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess,
if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share
of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the total
number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the aggregate amount of
such payment rounded down to the nearest cent (the " _Option Consideration_
"). The Option Consideration will be paid in a lump sum promptly after the
Effective Time (but no later than ten Business Days after the Effective
Time). As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company will provide written notice (a copy of which will be furnished to
Parent not fewer than five Business Days prior to sending such written notice)
to each Person who is a holder of Company Stock Options describing the
treatment of and, if applicable, payment for such Company Stock Options
pursuant to this _Section 2.04(a)_ and providing instructions for obtaining
payment for such Company Stock Options.

 



14 (b) For the avoidance of doubt, and without duplication, by virtue of the
Merger, each restricted share of Company Stock which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Restricted Share_ ")
will vest, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, as of the Effective Time, and at the Effective Time, each
Company Restricted Share will be deemed a share of Company Stock, subject to
_Section 2.07_, and will be entitled to the Merger Consideration as set forth
in this _Article 2_. 

(c) Each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan (other than awards of
Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Shares) entitling the holder
thereof to shares of Company Stock or cash equal to or based on the value of
Company Stock (a " _Share Unit_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, be cancelled and the holder thereof will,
subject to _Section 2.07_, receive from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay such holder) an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Stock
underlying such Share Units and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " _Share
Unit Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Share Unit will
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Share Unit Payment. The Share Unit will be paid in a lump sum promptly after
the Effective Time (but no later than ten Business Days after the
Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that such payment
would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the
Code with respect to a Share Unit, the payment will instead be made at the
time specified in the applicable Company Stock Plan and related award
document.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions as are
reasonably requested by Parent to assure that, upon consummation of the
Merger, all Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and Share Units
are, without further action, cancelled and thereafter represent only the right
(if applicable) to payment as herein provided and otherwise to give effect to
the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.04_.

Section 2.05. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.02_ and
_Section 2.03_, shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor
of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section
262 of Delaware Law (such shares being referred to collectively as the "
_Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holderÂ’s appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect
to such shares) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration but instead will be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses such holderÂ’s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of
Delaware Law or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of Delaware Law,
such shares of Company Stock will be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.02(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such share (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.08_) or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company will provide Parent
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and

 



15  any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relates to such demand, and
Parent will have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands under the applicable provisions
of Delaware Law. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, given or
withheld in its discretion, the Company will not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

Section 2.06. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Stock are
changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares or stock dividend thereon with a record
date during such period), the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement will be appropriately adjusted.

 

Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article 2_ such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If
the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
so withholds amounts, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably require, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this  _Article 2_.

ARTICLE 3

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

 

Section 3.01. _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time and by
virtue of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Company will be
amended to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto and, as so
amended, will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law. Nothing in this
_Section 3.01_ will affect in any way the indemnification and advancement
obligations provided for in _Section 7.02_.

Section 3.02. _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company will
be amended to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and as so amended will be the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
Delaware Law. Nothing in this _Section 3.02_ will affect in any way the
indemnification and advancement obligations provided for in  _Section 7.02_.

 



16 Section 3.03. _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with Applicable Law, (a) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective
Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers
of the Company at the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

ARTICLE 4

Subject to _Section 11.05_, except (a) as disclosed in any Company SEC

Section 4.18. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) _Section 4.18(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct
and complete list of each material Employee Plan. " _Employee Plan_ " means
each "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or
not subject to ERISA, each employment, severance or similar contract, plan,
arrangement or policy and each other plan or arrangement (written or oral)
providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other
stock related rights or other material forms of incentive or deferred
compensation, vacation benefits, health or medical benefits, employee
assistance program, profit sharing, disability or sick leave
benefits, workersÂ’ compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits,
severance benefits and post-employment or retirement benefits (including
compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits) which is
maintained, administered or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has any obligation to contribute.

(b) With respect to each Employee Plan, to the extent applicable, the Company
has furnished or made available to Parent (i) the plan, (ii) the trust
agreement, (iii) the summary plan description, (iv) the most recent annual
report on Form 5500, and (v) the most recent determination letter.

(c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessor thereof
has or had any liability in respect of any Employee Plan or similar
arrangement under Title IV of ERISA and no condition exists that could
reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any
liability under Title IV of ERISA or any liability under any multiemployer
plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

(d) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter
in the case of a prototype or volume submitter plan), or has pending or has
time remaining in which to file, an application for such determination from
the Internal Revenue Service, and nothing has occurred that could reasonably
be expected to cause such determination letter to be revoked or not be
reissued. Each Employee Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by Applicable Law.

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in
respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries except
as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code or other
Applicable Law.

 



29 (f) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating
to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan
which would significantly increase the expense of maintaining such Employee
Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.

(g) All contributions due under each Employee Plan have been paid when due or
properly accrued on the CompanyÂ’s consolidated financial statements.

(h) There is no Proceeding pending against or involving or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened against or involving, any Employee Plan.

(i) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement could reasonably be
expected to, either alone or in conjunction with any other event (whether
contingent or otherwise), (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or
payable, or required to be provided, to any current or former director,
employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise
payable or required to be provided to any such current or former director,
employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of
any such benefit or compensation, or (iii) result in any amount failing to be
deductible by reason of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

 

(j) No Employee Plan provides any individual with a "gross up" or similar
payment in respect of any Taxes that may become payable under Section 409A or
Section 4999 of the Code. To the knowledge of the Company, with respect to
each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within
the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and is subject to Section 409A
of the Code, (i) the written terms of such Employee Plan have at all times
since January 1, 2009 been in compliance with, and (ii) such Employee Plan
has, at all times while subject to Section 409A of the Code, been operated in
compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder.

(k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has incurred any
obligation in connection with the termination of or withdrawal from any
Non-U.S. Plan. The present value of the accrued benefit liabilities (whether
or not vested) under each Non-U.S. Plan, determined as of the end of the
CompanyÂ’s most recently ended fiscal year on a the basis of actuarial
assumptions, each of which is reasonable, did not exceed the current value
of the assets of such Non-U.S. Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities.

Section 4.19. _Labor_.

 

(a) To the extent any Person is employed or engaged by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as an independent contractor or leased employee (leased from
another employer), the Company or applicable Subsidiary has properly
classified such Person, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Any current
employee classified as exempt from overtime wages has been properly
classified as such by the Company or applicable Subsidiary, except as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

collective bargaining agreements with any Persons employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Persons otherwise performing services primarily
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no employee of the Company or

right will be exercised in connection with the transactions contemplated

any fine or forfeiture or take any other action or agreed to any extension of
time with respect to any FCC investigation or proceeding.

(d) The FCC Licensees are qualified under the Communications Act to assign
the FCC Licenses to Buyer. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts

ParentÂ’s representations and warranties in  _Section 5.05_, the Company has
taken all action necessary so that the restrictions on "business combinations"
otherwise applicable under Section 203 of Delaware Law (" _Section 203_ ") do
not apply to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and, accordingly, no such restrictions nor
other antiÂ–takeover or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to
apply to any such transactions. No other "business combination," "control
share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other antiÂ–takeover laws
enacted under U.S. state or federal laws apply to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

financial point of view.

Financing Commitment_ "), including the term sheets attached thereto, and a
customarily redacted fee letter related to such Debt Financing Commitment,
pursuant to which the lenders set forth therein have agreed to lend, subject
to the conditions contained therein, the amounts set forth therein (the "
_Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) a fully executed Equity Financing Commitment,
dated as of August 25, 2013, by and between Wasserstein Partners III, LP and
Parent (the " _Equity Financing Commitment_ " and together with the Debt
Financing Commitment, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the
Sponsor (as defined therein) has committed to invest, subject to the
conditions contained therein, the amount set forth therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ " and together with the Debt Financing, and each for the purposes
of consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the "
_Financing_ ").

 

(b) Except as set forth on _Section 5.08(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, the Financing Commitments and the fee letter referenced in the Debt
Financing Commitment are the only agreements entered into by Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent with respect to the Financing and there are no side
letters or other oral or written agreements, arrangements or
understandings relating to the funding of the full amount of the Financing.
None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified except to the
extent permitted by this Agreement, and, as of the date hereof, the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect, and, as of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default thereunder;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent is not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect of
(i) any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties set forth in _Article
4_ or (ii) the failure of the Company to comply with any covenant herein. As
of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full force and
effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and the other
parties thereto (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditorsÂ’
rights generally and general principles of equity whether considered in a
proceeding at equity or at law). All commitment fees and other fees required
to be paid pursuant to each of the Financing Commitments have been paid in
full or will be duly paid in full when due. There are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing
Commitments. The aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements
contemplated by the Financing

 



37  Commitments, when funded in accordance therewith, will, together with cash
and cash equivalents of the Company, be sufficient for Parent and the
Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, the Option
Consideration, amounts necessary to repay all outstanding amounts under the
Credit Agreement and all payments, fees and expenses related to or arising out
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_ and _9.02_ , as of the date of
this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will
not be available to Parent and Merger Subsidiary at the Closing as
contemplated in the Financing Commitments.

 

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary is, as of the date hereof, aware of
any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or
statements set forth in any Financing Commitment inaccurate in any material
respect or that would cause the commitments provided in any Financing
Commitment to be terminated or ineffective or any of the conditions contained
therein not to be met.

Section 5.09. _Operations of Merger Subsidiary_. Merger Subsidiary has been
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated
hereby and, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary will not engage in
any other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or
obligations other than as contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.10. _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to
ParentÂ’s obligations to consummate the Merger as set forth herein and (b) the
accuracy, in all material respects, of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in _Article 4_ hereof, (i) immediately after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the closing of
any financing to be obtained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in order to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation will, as of such date, be able to pay its debts as they become
due and will own property having a fair saleable value greater than the
amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and mature, and
(ii) immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the closing of any financing to be obtained by Parent or any of
its Affiliates in order to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation will not have, as of such date,
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business. Neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary is entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.11.  _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Guarantor has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guaranty executed
by the Guarantor, in favor of the Company, with respect to certain matters,
including guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary,
respectively, in connection with this Agreement, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein. With respect to the Guaranty, (a) the Guarantor
has the requisite limited partnership power and authority to execute, deliver
and perform the Guaranty, (b) the execution, delivery and performance by the
Guarantor of the Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary limited
partnership action on the part of the Guarantor, (c) the Guaranty has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes a
valid and legally binding agreement of it, enforceable against the Guarantor
in

 



38  accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditorsÂ’ rights generally and general principles of equity whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), (d) the execution, delivery
and performance by the Guarantor of the Guaranty require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, (e) the execution,
delivery and performance by the Guarantor of the Guaranty do not and will not
(i) violate the organizational documents of the Guarantor or (ii) violate any
Applicable Law, and (f) the Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and
perform its obligations under the Guaranty, and all funds necessary for the
Guaranty to fulfill its obligation under the Guaranty will be available to the
Guarantor for so long as the Guaranty remains in effect. 

Section 5.12. _Agreements with Company Stockholders, Directors or Management_.
As of the date hereof, neither Parent or Merger Subsidiary nor any of their
respective Affiliates is a party to any contract or agreement, or has any oral
or written agreement, arrangement or understanding, with any member of the
CompanyÂ’s management, or any director or stockholder of the Company that
relate in any way to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.13. _Access to Information; Disclaimer_. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an opportunity to
discuss the business and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the
management of the Company, (b) has had reasonable access to (i) the books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) the electronic dataroom
maintained on behalf of the Company for purposes of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) has been afforded the opportunity to ask
questions of and receive answers from officers of the Company, and (d) has
conducted its own independent investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, their respective businesses and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and has not relied on the accuracy or completeness of material
provided by the Company or on (and there is not) any representation, warranty
or other statement by any Person on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than the representations and warranties of the Company
expressly contained in _Article 4_  of this Agreement and that all other
representations and warranties are specifically disclaimed.

Section 5.14.  _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts,
Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due
diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary have received and may continue to receive from the
Company certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their businesses and operations.
Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby acknowledge that (a) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such
business plans, (b) Parent and Merger Subsidiary are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information,
as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans), and Parent and
Merger Subsidiary are not relying on such estimates, projections, forecasts
and other forward-looking statements, or such business plans ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing representation in this clause (b) will in no
event be

 



39  deemed breached if such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements were not prepared by management of the Company in good
faith based on what they believed to be the best information then reasonably
available to management), and (c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary will have no
claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates,
advisors, agents or representatives, with respect thereto, except for actual
fraud. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby acknowledge that,
except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, none of the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, has made
or is making any representation or warranty with respect to such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans). Nothing
in this _Section 5.14_ will impair (or be construed to impair) the rights of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary in respect of any of the representations and
warranties in _Article 4_ or any covenant or agreement of the Company
contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 5.15. _FCC Qualification_. Subject to the receipt of the FCC Consents
and the related FCC Final Orders, Parent and Merger Subsidiary are legally,
financially and otherwise qualified under the Communications Act and the FCC
Rules to acquire controlling interest of the FCC Licenses to operate the
business as presently conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries. Subject
to the receipt of the FCC Consents and the related FCC Final Orders, to the
knowledge of Parent, there are no facts that would, under Applicable Law and
the existing FCC Rules, disqualify Parent or Merger Subsidiary as an assignee
of the FCC Licenses or to operate the business as presently conducted by the
Company and its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of Parent, no waiver of or
exemption from the Communications Act or any FCC Rule is necessary for any FCC
Consent or related FCC Final Order to be obtained.

Section 6.03. _No Solicitation; Other Offers; Obligation to Terminate
Existing Discussions_.

solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the
submission of any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or
participate in any negotiations with, or furnish any information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business,

adopt or recommend to the stockholders of the Company any Company Acquisition
Proposal, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend to the
stockholders of the Company any Company Acquisition Proposal (any of the
foregoing in this clause (iv), an " _Adverse Company Recommendation Change_
"), or (v) resolve or propose to do any of the foregoing. The Company will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person conducted
prior to the date hereof with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. For
the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a Person contacts the Company or a
Representative of the Company or its Affiliates orally or in writing
regarding a potential Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company will not be in
breach of this Agreement in any respect to the extent the Company or such
Representative responds to such Person that it is bound by the terms of this
Agreement and is unable to discuss or respond to such matters without first
complying with the procedures set forth herein with respect to any such
discussions; _provided_ that the Company complies with the
notification obligations to Parent set forth herein in connection with such
inquiry by such Person. Without limiting the foregoing, subject to _Section
6.03(b)_, the Company will not fail to enforce, or grant any waiver, amendment
or release under, any standstill agreement (or any standstill provisions of
any other contract or agreement with respect to shares of Company Stock or
other equity securities of the Company).

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding _Section 6.03(a)_, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, directly or
indirectly through its Subsidiaries and its and its SubsidiariesÂ’
Representatives or other intermediaries, may (i) following the receipt of a
Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
_Section 6.03_, contact the Person or group of Persons who has made such
Company Acquisition Proposal to clarify and understand the terms and
conditions thereof, (ii) if the Board of Directors or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (A) engage in negotiations
or discussions with any Person or group of Persons (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, its or their Representatives or financing sources) that
has made after the date of this Agreement such Company Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines
in good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal and (B) furnish to such Person or group of Persons (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, its or their Representatives or financing sources)
information (including non-public information) relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person or
group of Persons, in each case pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (including standstill
restrictions) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that all such information (to the extent that such information is
material and has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently
with the time it is provided or made available to such Person or group of
Persons (and in any event, within 24 hours), and (iii) take any nonappealable,
final action that any court

 



45  of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take, in each case referred
to in the foregoing subclause (ii) only if the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action with respect
to such Company Acquisition Proposal would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein will prevent the Board of Directors
of the Company from (x) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14D-9 under the
1934 Act with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal so long as any action
taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this _Section 6.03_
or (y) making any disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof, after receipt of advice from its outside counsel, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;
_provided_ , that any such position or disclosure (other than a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act, in each case that includes a reaffirmation
of the Company Board Recommendation, a factually accurate public statement
describing the CompanyÂ’s receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal or a
statement to the effect that a Company Acquisition Proposal is under
consideration by the Board of Directors of the Company) will be deemed to be
an Adverse Company Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of the
Company expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation.

(c)  _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors of the Company will not take
any of the actions referred to in _Sections 6.03(b)(ii)-(iii)_ unless the
Company first delivers to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that
it intends to take such action. In addition, the Company will notify Parent
promptly (but in no event later than two Business Days) after receipt by the
Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal or
of any request received by the Company (or any of its Representatives) for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Person or group of Persons that has made, or that has
notified the Company (or any of its Representatives) that it is considering
making, a Company Acquisition Proposal or that is reasonably expected to lead
to a Company Acquisition Proposal. In connection with any notice required
hereby, the Company will (i) provide to Parent the material terms and
conditions (including the identity of the third party making any such Company
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request) of any such Company
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request and (ii) keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and material details (including any material change to
the terms thereof) of any such Company Acquisition Proposal and any
discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions
thereof. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into
any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits
the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section 6.03_.

(d) _Adverse Company Recommendation Change_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof may, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval,
(i) effect an Adverse Company Recommendation Change in response to
an Intervening Event, if the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof determines in good faith, based on the opinion of outside
legal counsel and after consultation with its outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would breach its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, or (ii)

 



46  effect an Adverse Company Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ in response to a Company Acquisition
Proposal made after the date of this Agreement (and not the result of a
breach of this _Section 6.03_) that the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel constitutes a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Company has provided prior
written notice to Parent, at least five Business Days (the " _Notice Period_
") in advance, of its intention to take any such action referred to in clause
(i) or (ii) of this _Section 6.03(d)_, (B) in the event of an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change in the circumstances described in clause (i) above, (1)
the Company has provided a reasonable summary of the facts and circumstances
of such Intervening Event, together with a copy of a legal opinion of outside
legal counsel that the failure to effect an Adverse Company Recommendation
Change with respect to such Intervening Event would breach the Board of
DirectorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, in its notice thereof, (2)
the Company has caused its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes
to make such adjustments, and (3) the Board of Directors has considered any
Proposed Changed Terms (as defined below) offered no later than 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the fifth Business Day of such five-Business Day period
and has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and outside financial advisors) that the failure to effect an Adverse
Company Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening Event would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, and (C) in the event of an Adverse Company Recommendation
Change or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ in
the circumstances described in clause (ii) above, (1) the Company has attached
to such notice the most current version of the proposed agreement of any
such Superior Proposal (which version will be updated on a prompt basis), (2)
the Company has caused its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Acquisition
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its
discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being understood and agreed
(I) that in the event that, after commencement of the Notice Period, there is
any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any
revision in price, the Notice Period will be extended, if applicable, to
ensure that at least five Business Days remain in the Notice Period
subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material
revision (it being understood that any material revision or amendment to the
terms of such Superior Proposal will require a new _Section
6.03(d)_ notice), and (II) that there may be multiple extensions of the
Notice Period), and (3) the Board of Directors has considered any adjustments
to this Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other
agreements contemplated hereby that may be offered in writing by Parent
(collectively, the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the fifth Business Day of such five-Business Day period and
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and outside financial advisors) that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were
to be given effect; _provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that any purported
termination of this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section
6.03(d)_ will be void and of no force and effect unless such termination by
the Company is in accordance with  _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ and, as a condition
precedent to such termination, the Company has paid Parent the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 11.04(b)(i)(B)_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination. 

 



47 (e) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Superior Proposal_ " means a Company Acquisition Proposal that is on terms
that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines
in good faith, after considering the advice of its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and
conditions of the Company Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions, certainty of completion and conditions to
consummation, as well as any Proposed Changed Terms proposed by Parent in
response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, are more favorable to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders than as provided hereunder (after giving effect to the
Proposed Changed Terms). For purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal" each reference to "15%" in the definition of "Company Acquisition
Proposal" will be replaced with "80%."

 

Section 6.04. _Access to Information_.

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable
Law and the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below), the Company will (i)
give Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon prior reasonable written notice, to the officers, employees,
offices, properties, books and records, other than Classified Contracts, of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) furnish Parent and its
Representatives such financial and operating data and other information as
such Persons may reasonably request in writing. Any access provided pursuant
to this _Section 6.04_ will be provided in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties. Neither
the Company nor its Subsidiaries will be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the Company or its Subsidiaries or contravene any
Applicable Law or binding agreement entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement (as long as the Company has
used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any third party
required thereunder). No information or knowledge obtained pursuant to this
_Section 6.04_ will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder.

(b) Without limiting _Section 6.04(a)_, the Company will furnish to Parent
(i) all audited financial statements for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the period ended June 30, 2013 and (ii) for the interim period from the most
recent audited period to the Closing Date, internally prepared, unaudited
financial statements for the Company and its Subsidiaries for each quarterly
period completed prior to 46 days before the Closing Date and for each
monthly period completed prior to 31 days before the Closing Date.

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary will hold and treat and will cause
its Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent,
its Affiliates or its and their Representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the Non-
Disclosure Agreement, dated January 11, 2013, by and between the Company and
an Affiliate of Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

 



48 Section 6.05. _Parent and Merger Subsidiary Expenses_. The Company will,
within three Business Days of the date hereof, pay to Parent an amount equal
to $2,000,000 to reimburse Parent and Merger Subsidiary for its fees, expenses
and costs incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby prior to the date hereof (such amount, the " _Parent
Reimbursement Amount_ ").

ARTICLE 7

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

Section 7.01. _Voting_ _._ Parent will vote any shares of Company Stock
beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of
this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting, and will take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Immediately after the execution of
this Agreement, Parent will cause this Agreement to be adopted by the sole
stockholder of Merger Subsidiary in accordance with Delaware Law and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Subsidiary and deliver to
the Company evidence of such vote or action by written consent so approving
and adopting this Agreement.

Section 7.02. _Director and Officer Liability_.

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs (the " _Indemnification End Date_ "), Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the current and
former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnified Person_ ") in respect of any and all costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with (i) the fact that an Indemnified Person is
or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the
Effective Time in such Indemnified PersonÂ’s capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates, or (iii) the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, to the fullest extent that the Company and
its Subsidiaries would be permitted or required to indemnify the Indemnified
Persons under the CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect
as of the date hereof or any indemnity contract filed with the SEC prior to
the Measurement Date. In addition, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the Indemnification End Date, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to advance, prior to the final disposition of
any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may
be sought under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified
Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry to the
same extent as so permitted or required; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
Person to whom funds are advanced pursuant to this

 



49   _Section 7.02(a)_ must, if requested by the Surviving Corporation, provide
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing in
this _Section 7.02(a)_, if, prior to the Indemnification End Date, any
Indemnified Person delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification and/or advancement under this _Section
7.02(a)_ in reasonable detail as to any specific actual or threatened action,
suit, proceeding or claim, then the right to indemnification and/or
advancement with respect to the claim asserted in such notice will survive
the Indemnification End Date until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved.

(b) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or
other agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement will remain obligations of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, will survive the Merger and will continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. Further, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause such
documents to) contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers than are presently set forth in the applicable entityÂ’s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents), which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain and fully pay the premium
for the non-cancelable extension of the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
coverage of the CompanyÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance policies
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") for a claims reporting or discovery
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to
any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the total aggregate amount payable for such
"tail" insurance policy will not exceed 300% of the premium amount per annum
the Company paid in its last full fiscal year as set forth in _Section
7.02(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (such 300% amount, the " _Maximum
Tail Premium_ "); _provided_ that, if the cost for such "tail" insurance
policy exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium, then the Company will be permitted to
obtain a substantially similar policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium. In the event that the
Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder for so long as such
"tail" policy is maintained in full force and effect. If the Company for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the CompanyÂ’s existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving

 



50  Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable
than as provided in the CompanyÂ’s existing policies as of the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of the Maximum Tail Premium; and _provided_
, _further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision will be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, will assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.02_. In addition, the Surviving Corporation will not distribute,
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to
satisfy its obligations under this _Section 7.02_. The rights of this
_Section 7.02_ are intended to be for the benefit of the Indemnified
Persons and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this  _Section 7.02_ will be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable governing documents) of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or
under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, will be construed to
or will release, waive or impair any rights to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this  _Section
7.02_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies. These rights will survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person,
and will not be terminated or modified in a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Person to whom this _Section 7.02_ applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Party.

 

Section 7.03. _Employee Matters_.

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to give each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time who continues employment with the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Affiliates (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ," and collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") full credit for prior service with the Company or
its Subsidiaries for purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting under any Parent
Employee Plan (as defined below) and (b) determination of benefit levels under
any Parent Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance, but not
for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan, in each case for which the
Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee
is offered participation, but except where such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent will waive, or cause to be
waived, any

 



51  limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same
extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of Parent and
recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under
its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by
Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Parent Employee Plan_ " means any
"employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and each other
plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for vacation benefits, health
or medical benefits, employee assistance program, disability or sick leave
benefits, workersÂ’ compensation, and supplemental unemployment benefits (but
not including any defined benefit pension plan or equity-based plan).

 

(b) Nothing in this _Section 7.03_ will (i) be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan, (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending any employee
benefit plan, or (iii) confer any rights, remedies or benefits on any Person
other than the parties to this Agreement, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period, compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or under an Employee Plan
that such employee or beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have
under the terms of the Employee Plan (it being understood that the provisions
of this _Section 7.03_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement).

 

Section 7.04. _Equity Financing Commitment_.

(a) Parent and Merger Subsidiary will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Equity Financing, including using their reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Equity Financing Commitment until
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) comply with all
covenants and agreements of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in the
Equity Financing Commitment, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in the Equity Financing
Commitment that are within their control (excluding any condition where the
failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the CompanyÂ’s failure to
furnish information reasonably requested by Parent in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement), (iv) upon satisfaction of such conditions and other
conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_ and _Section 9.02_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, subject to
the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) and subject to the other terms
and provisions of this Agreement and the Equity Financing
Commitment, consummate the financing contemplated by the Equity Financing
Commitment at or prior to the Closing (and in any event prior to the Outside
Date), and (vi) enforce the obligations of the Sponsor (and the rights of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary) under the Equity Financing Commitment, but only
to the extent set forth in _Section 11.13(b)_.

(b) Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary will amend, alter or waive, or agree
to amend, alter or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term
of the Equity Financing Commitment without the prior written consent of the
Company to the extent such amendment, alteration or waiver would reasonably
be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of cash proceeds available from
the Equity Financing to fund the amounts required to be paid by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement below the amount, when aggregated with
the Debt Financing, required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) impose new or additional
conditions, otherwise expand or 

 



52  modify any conditions to the receipt of the Equity Financing in a manner
materially adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary or otherwise be reasonably
likely to prevent, impair or materially delay the ability of Parent to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Equity
Financing Commitment. Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed with
respect to all material activity concerning the Equity Financing and will give
the Company prompt notice of any adverse change with respect to the Equity
Financing. Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees to notify the Company
promptly if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) the Equity Financing
Commitment expires or is terminated for any reason, (ii) the Sponsor refuses
to provide the full Equity Financing on the terms set forth in the Equity
Financing Commitment, or (iii) for any reason, Parent or Merger Subsidiary no
longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Equity Financing on the terms set forth in the Equity
Financing Commitment.

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary each acknowledge and agree that the obtaining
of the Equity Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

Section 7.05. _Debt Financing Commitment_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Subsidiary will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Debt Financing Commitment ( _provided_ , that, to the extent applicable,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary may replace or amend the Debt Financing
Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities which had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of
the date hereof, or otherwise if the terms would not adversely impact the
ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or the likelihood of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), including by using reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment and negotiate and enter into
a definitive agreement (collectively, the " _Debt Financing Agreement_ ")
with respect to the Debt Financing Commitment on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment until the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) comply with all covenants and
agreements of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment or Debt Financing Agreement, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment or Debt Financing Agreement that are within their control
(excluding any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct
result of the CompanyÂ’s failure to furnish information reasonably requested
by Parent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), (iv) upon
satisfaction of such conditions and the other conditions set forth in _Section
9.01_ and _Section 9.02_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions) and subject to the other terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the Debt Financing Commitment or Debt Financing Agreement, to
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing (and in any event
prior to the Outside Date), and (v) enforce the obligations of the lenders
(and the rights of Parent and Merger Subsidiary) under the Debt Financing
Commitment or Debt Financing Agreement (including, in the event that all
conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment (other than the availability of
funding of any of the financing contemplated under the Equity Financing
Commitment) have been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, to use
reasonable best efforts to cause the lender party to the Debt Financing

 



53  Commitment to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Parent will
furnish to the Company correct and complete copies of any Debt Financing
Agreement or any alternative Debt Financing Commitment and, in each case,
ancillary documents thereto (redacted to the extent necessary to comply with
confidentiality agreements, _provided_ that such redacted information does
not relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or contain any conditions
precedent to, the funding of the Debt Financing).

(b) Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all
material activity concerning the Debt Financing and will give the Company
prompt notice of any adverse change with respect to the Debt Financing.
Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary will, nor will it permit any of its
Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take any
action or enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition,
joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that
could reasonably be expected to impair, materially delay or prevent
consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing. Neither Parent nor
Merger Subsidiary will amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, a Debt
Financing Commitment in any manner that would impair, materially delay or
prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Company to the extent such amendment or alteration
would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of cash
proceeds available from the Debt Financing to fund the amounts required to be
paid by Parent or Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement below the amount,
when aggregated with the Equity Financing, required to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) impose new
or additional conditions, otherwise expand or modify any conditions to the
receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner materially adverse to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary or otherwise be reasonably likely to prevent, impair or
materially delay the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or adversely impact the ability
of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Debt Financing Commitment.

(c) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to, and will cause its
Representatives and each of its Subsidiaries and their Representatives to use
their reasonable best efforts to, provide all cooperation that is customary
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested in writing by Parent ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation
does not materially interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries), including, to the extent required in connection with the
Debt Financing Commitment, the Debt Financing Agreement or the terms of any
alternative financing, (i) participating in meetings, due diligence sessions,
road shows and lender presentations, (ii) assisting with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda and
similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing, (iii)
furnishing to Parent and its debt financing sources with pertinent and
customary information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case
reasonably requested in writing by Parent, including any information required

required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the 1933 Act for an

S-1 (subject to exceptions customary for a private placement of secured or
unsecured non-convertible high-yield debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A

 



54  promulgated under the Securities Act), including any information that would
be required by (I) Sections 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (II) Item 402 of
Regulation S-K, and (III) information regarding executive compensation and
related party disclosure related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A, 34-54302A and

forma consolidated statement of income of the Company as of, and for the
12-month period ending on, the last day of the most recently completed four-
fiscal quarter period ended at least 45 days (or 90 days, in case such four-
fiscal quarter period is the end of the CompanyÂ’s fiscal year) prior to the
Closing Date, prepared after giving effect to the Merger and the Financing as
if the Merger and the Financing had occurred as of such date (in the case of
such balance sheet) or at the beginning of such period (in the case of
such statement of income) and as if Regulation S-X under the Securities Act
were applicable to such pro forma balance sheet and statement of income, only
if Parent or Merger Subsidiary has provided the Company information relating
to the proposed debt and equity capitalization and a preliminary allocation
of purchase price in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations" prior to
the date pro forma financial statements are required to be delivered, which
information will include (A) any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings,
capitalization and other post-Closing or pro forma adjustments (and the
assumptions relating thereto) desired by the Parent to be reflected in such
pro forma financial statements and (B) any other information that may be
reasonably and timely requested by the Company concerning the assumptions
underlying the post-Closing or pro forma adjustments to be made in such pro
forma financial statements, which assumptions shall be the responsibility of

included in a preliminary offering memorandum for an offering of secured or

offering, and (D) all other information and data reasonably necessary for
Parent to satisfy the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment
(collectively, the " _Required Information_ "), (iv) obtaining any legal

liens on the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the Debt Financing, (vi) assisting in the preparation of, and executing
and delivering definitive financing agreements, including guarantees,
collateral documents and customary pay-off letters, lien releases and
instruments of discharge, perfection certificates and officerÂ’s certificates,
as are customary in financings of such type (including a certificate of an
appropriate financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency) and
other agreements as may be reasonably requested by Parent or the sources of
Financing), (vii) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent
and its financing sources for all or any portion of the Debt Financing,

participate in a reasonable number of presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions and customary meetings and sessions with financing sources
and ratings agencies in connection with the Financing, (viii) providing
requested authorization letters to the financing sources, (ix) cooperating
with the financing sourcesÂ’ customary securities underwriting and secured

55  documents, and (x) assisting Parent and Merger Subsidiary to procure prior
to or concurrent with the launch of syndication, at ParentÂ’s expense, ratings
for the Debt Financing from each of Standard and PoorÂ’s Ratings Services and
MoodyÂ’s Investor Services, Inc. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required, under the provisions of this _Section 7.05(c)_
or otherwise in connection with any Financing, to commit to take any action
that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any
agreement) or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time or that
would otherwise subject it to actual or potential liability in connection
with any Financing. Nothing contained in this _Section 7.05(c)_ or otherwise
will require the Company to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to any
Financing prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) To the extent required in connection with the Debt Financing Commitment,
the Debt Financing Agreement or the terms of any alternative financing, the
Company hereby consents to the use of its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ logos solely
for the purpose of obtaining the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
intellectual property rights.

 

(e) Parent and Merger Subsidiary each acknowledge and agree that the obtaining
of the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Closing. 

Section 7.06. _Alternative Financing_. Parent and Merger Subsidiary will give
the Company prompt notice (a) of any actual or alleged breach or default by
any party to any agreement in respect of the Debt Financing Commitment, (b) of
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
source of Debt Financing with respect to any actual or alleged breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any agreement in respect
of the Debt Financing Commitment, or (c) if Parent and Merger Subsidiary
determine in good faith that they will not be able to satisfy any of the
obligations to, or otherwise be able to obtain, some or any portion of the
Debt Financing prior to the Outside Date. If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable, and such portion is required to fund the aggregate
Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration, amounts necessary to repay
all outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement and all fees, expenses and
other amounts related to or arising out of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent and Merger Subsidiary will use their reasonable best
efforts to promptly arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when added to the
portion of the Financing that is available together with any cash or cash
equivalents held by the Company as of the Effective Time, to pay in cash the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration, amounts necessary to
repay all outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement and all fees,
expenses and other amounts relating to or arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or
construed to require Parent to, and Parent will not be required to, (i) pay
any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or
the redacted fee letter accompanying the Debt Financing Commitment, (ii) agree
to any term that is outside of, or less favorable than, any applicable
economic provisions of the Debt Financing Commitment or any related fee
letter, or (iii) amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or under
any of the Debt Financing Commitments. Any reference in

 



56  this Agreement to (A) the "Debt Financing" will include any such alternative
debt financing, (B) the "Financing" will include any such alternative
financing, (C) the "Debt Financing Commitment" will include any such
alternative debt commitment, (D) the "Financing Commitments" will include any
such alternative financing commitments, and (E) the "Debt
Financing Agreement" will include the definitive agreement(s) with respect to
any such alternative debt financing. Parent will keep the Company informed on
a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts
to arrange any alternative financing and provide copies of all documents
provided to the lenders or otherwise related to such alternative financing to
the Company.

or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (a) causing the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article 9_ to

Governmental Authority or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.02. _Regulatory Filings_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, will use reasonable best efforts to obtain all requisite
approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, and, as applicable, ITAR and NISPOM, and will (i)
cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing or submission
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other party reasonably
informed, including by providing the other party with a copy, of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Authority and
of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review in advance any 

 



57  communication planned to be given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other U.S.
or foreign Governmental Authority in respect thereof or, in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Authority
or other Person, give the other party or its Representatives the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 8.02(a)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein will be given
only to the outside counsel regarding antitrust Applicable Law of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by outside counsel to employees,
officers, directors or consultants of the recipient or any of its affiliates
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (the Company or Parent as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Each of the Company and Parent will cause their respective outside counsel
regarding antitrust Applicable Law to comply with this _Section 8.02(a)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.02(a)_,
materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and privileged
communications.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
agrees to make appropriate filings under any antitrust Applicable Law,
including an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, as promptly
as reasonably practicable, to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act, and to take all other actions necessary,
proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act, including by requesting early termination
of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act.

(c) In connection with this Agreement, the parties agree that a final joint
voluntary notice to CFIUS will be submitted for filing as soon as practicable
following the receipt of a request by CFIUS that CFIUS desires to review the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In such event, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will
cooperate in preparing, pre-filing and filing with CFIUS a joint voluntary
notice of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to Exon-Florio and
FINSA. Parent and Merger Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, will each use its reasonable best efforts to provide CFIUS with
any information required for the CFIUS filing or that is requested by CFIUS or
its member agencies during the Exon-Florio review or FINSA investigation
process. Information furnished by a party to the other party may be included
in the CFIUS filing unless contrary instructions are specified in writing to
the party receiving such information. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this _Section 8.02(c)_, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company,
in cooperation with each other, will use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
avoid possible rejection or deferred acceptance of any CFIUS filing, (ii)
respond as promptly as practicable and within any time limitations imposed by
applicable regulations to any inquiries from CFIUS or any other Governmental
Authority involved in the review, (iii) make any other submissions that are
required to be made or that the parties agree should be made, and (iv) obtain
the CFIUS Approval so as to enable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event, with the consummation of the Merger to occur no later than the Outside
Date). Furthermore, such

 



58  reasonable best efforts with respect to Parent and Merger Subsidiary will
include jointly working with CFIUS as required to agree upon and execute a
mutually acceptable FOCI mitigation plan to mitigate (i) foreign ownership,
control and influence for a contractor working on secret and top secret
projects for U.S. Governmental Authorities, and (ii) threats to national
security in order to terminate CFIUS reviews. Parent and Merger Subsidiary,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will also cooperate in
the preparation of filing any notices required under ITAR and/or NISPOM.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Section 8.02(a)_, _Section 8.02(b)_ and _Section 8.02(c)_, if
any suit is instituted or mitigation proposed (or threatened to be instituted
or proposed) by the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS or any other Governmental Authority or
any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any antitrust or other Applicable Laws or which would otherwise
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or
suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event will Parent
or Merger Subsidiary be required to take any action or actions to the
extent that taking such action or actions would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, following the Effective
Time.

(e) The Company will provide the Defense Security Service (" _DSS_ ") and, to
the extent applicable, any other agency of the United States government,
timely notification of the transaction contemplated hereby in accordance with
NISPOM and the CompanyÂ’s industrial security obligations. The parties hereto
will cooperate with each other in obtaining approval from DSS for the Company
to maintain a facility security clearance (" _FCL_ ") at the level necessary
to continue the CompanyÂ’s operations, including performance on the CompanyÂ’s
classified contracts. In the event DSS requires measures to mitigate a finding
of Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (" _FOCI_ ") as a condition for
the Company to maintain an FCL at the level necessary to continue the
CompanyÂ’s operations, the Company and the Parent will jointly work with DSS in
a good faith effort to agree upon and execute a mutually acceptable FOCI
mitigation plan.

 

Section 8.03. _Proxy Statement and Other Required Company Filings_. As soon as
practicable following the date hereof (and in any event no later than 30
calendar days after the date of this Agreement, subject to the prompt receipt
from Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the information described in the second
sentence of this _Section 8.03_), the Company will prepare and file with the
SEC the Proxy Statement, in connection with the solicitation of proxies from
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders for use at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Parent

Merger Subsidiary (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable) as is

with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. The Company will use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof with the
SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not comment on, or that it has
no additional comments on, the Proxy Statement. Neither the

 



59  Company nor any of its Affiliates, if applicable, will correspond or
otherwise communicate with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement in any such case without providing Parent and Merger Subsidiary a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon or participate therein,
as the case may be. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
_Article 10_ , the Company will (i) advise Parent and Merger Subsidiary
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the
SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, any
receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any
receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in
connection therewith, and (ii) provide Parent and Merger Subsidiary with
copies of all correspondence with its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff, on the other hand with respect to the Proxy Statement
and any other filing required under Applicable Law. If at any time prior to
the Company Stockholder Meeting, any information relating to the Company,
Parent or Merger Subsidiary, or any of their respective directors, officers
or Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger
Subsidiary which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement or any other filing
required under Applicable Law, as applicable, would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the applicable filing
required under Applicable Law describing such information will be promptly
prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law
or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders. Except as
expressly permitted by _Section 6.03_, the Company will include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and, if applicable, any other
filing required under Applicable Law.

transactions contemplated hereby will be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent;

_provided_ , _however_ , in each case, that if such release or similar public
announcement is required by Applicable Law or stock market regulations, the
party required to make the release or announcement will use its reasonable
best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that
the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent
so required, will be at the final discretion of the disclosing party;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section
8.04_ will not apply to any release, announcement or disclosure made or
proposed to be made in connection with or following an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change.

 

Section 8.05. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and

 



60  on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the
Company or Merger Subsidiary, any other actions and things to vest, perfect
or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 8.06. _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent

Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any
Section of this Agreement or that relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of that party contained
in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 9.02(b)_ or _Section
9.03(b)_ not to be satisfied; and

(e) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that
could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in _Section
9.02(a)_ or _Section 9.03(a)_ not to be satisfied;

_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 8.06_ will not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder or limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Section 8.07.  _Section 16 Matters_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the 1934 Act and in accordance with the Interpretative

Effective Time;

 

(b) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other writing delivered by Parent or Merger Subsidiary pursuant
hereto shall be true and correct both when made and at and as of the Closing
Date as if made at and as of such time (other than representations and
warranties that by their terms address matters only as of another specified
time, which shall be true only as of such time), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without regard
to any qualifications or exceptions as to materiality contained in such
representations and warranties), would not, individually or in the aggregate,
impair, prevent or delay in any material respect the ability of each of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement; and

(c) _Officer Â’s Certificate_. The Company shall have received a
certificate signed by an authorized executive officer of Parent certifying to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.03(a)_ and
_Section 9.03(b)_.

Section 9.04. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither the Company nor
Parent may rely, as a basis for not consummating the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the failure of any condition
set forth in _Section 9.01_, _Section 9.02_ or _Section 9.03_, as the case
may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such partyÂ’s material
breach of any provision of this Agreement.

TERMINATION

Section 10.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger

approval of this Agreement by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders or Parent as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub):

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before February 25, 2014 (the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that upon the written agreement of
Parent and the Company, the Outside Date may be extended (and in the case of
such extension, any reference to the Outside Date in any other provision of
this Agreement shall be a reference to the Outside Date, as extended);
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ will not be available to
any party whose material breach of any provision of this Agreement has been
the primary cause of failure of the Effective Time to occur by the Outside
Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that ParentÂ’s failure to close due to the
unavailability of the Financing (or, if applicable, any alternative financing)
will not in any way limit its termination right pursuant to this _Section
10.01(b)(i)_, except to the extent such unavailability was caused or resulted
from the breach by Parent of _Sections 7.04_ , _7.05_ or _7.06_ ;

(ii) there shall be any Applicable Law that (A) makes consummation of the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) permanently enjoins the Company
or Parent from consummating the Merger and such injunction shall have become
final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(b)(ii)_ will not be available
to any party hereto unless such party has used such reasonable best efforts
as may be required by _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ to contest, appeal
and remove such injunction; _provided_ , _further_ _,_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(b)(ii)_ will not be
available to any party whose material breach of any provision of this
Agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted directly in, such
action; or

 

(iii) there shall not have occurred an Adverse Company Recommendation Change,
the Company Stockholder Meeting shall have been held and completed and the
Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained;

(c) by Parent:

 

(i) (A) at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if
an Adverse Company Recommendation Change shall have occurred, (B) at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company shall
have breached its obligations under _Section 6.03_ in any material respect,
or (C) if any event in  _Section 9.02(g)_ shall have occurred;

(ii) if there shall have been a breach by the Company of any of the covenants
or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Company, which breach would, individually or in
the aggregate, result in, the failure of a condition set forth in  _Section
9.02(a)_ or _Section 9.02(b)_ and cannot be cured by the Outside Date, or, if
curable, is not cured within 30 days following receipt of notice thereof to
the Company or, by its nature, cannot be cured within such period; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, at the time of delivery of such notice, Parent
or Merger Subsidiary shall not be in material breach of its or their
obligations under this Agreement; or

 



66 (d) by the Company:

 

(i) in accordance with _Section 6.03(d)_ upon the approval by the Board of
Directors to enter into a Superior Proposal and to substantially concurrently
therewith enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be in breach of with
_Section 6.03_ and shall have paid or shall concurrently with such
termination pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee under _Section
11.04(b)(i)(B)_;

(ii) if there shall have been a breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any
of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, which
breach would, individually or in the aggregate, result in, the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 9.03(a)_ or _Section 9.03(b)_ and cannot be
cured by the Outside Date, or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days
following receipt of notice thereof to Parent or, by its nature, cannot be
cured within such period; _provided_ , _however_ , that, at the time of
delivery of such notice, the Company shall not be in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) if (A) the conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_ and _Section 9.02_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing or those that have not been satisfied due to the
failure of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to have performed their respective
obligations under this Agreement) have been satisfied, (B) Parent and Merger
Subsidiary fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
within two Business Days of the date on which the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_, and (C) the Company is ready and
willing to consummate the Merger and has confirmed such fact by written notice
to Parent which has not been withdrawn, indicating that all conditions set
forth in  _Section 9.01_ and _Section 9.03_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ , that, at the time of
such termination, the Company shall not be in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable as described in the
second sentence of  _Section 7.06_ and Parent and Merger Subsidiary have
informed the Company that they are using their reasonable best efforts to
promptly arrange and obtain alternative financing in replacement thereof in
accordance with  _Section 7.06_, the Company will not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(d)(iii)_ until the
earlier of the Outside Date and the date on which Parent and Merger Subsidiary
cease to comply with their obligations under _Section 7.06_; or

(iv) there shall have occurred an Adverse Company Recommendation Change, the
Company Stockholder Meeting shall have been held and completed and the Company
Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained.

 



67 The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.01_ (other than pursuant to _Section 10.01(a)_) will give notice of such
termination to the other party specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made and the basis therefor described in reasonable
detail.

 

Section 10.02. _Effect of Termination_ _._ Any termination of this Agreement
under, and in accordance with, this _Article 10_ will be effective
immediately upon the delivery of a valid written notice of the terminating
party to the other parties hereto. In the event of the termination of this

of no further force or effect except for this _Section 10.02_, _Section
6.04(c)_, _Section 11.01_, _Section 11.04_, _Section 11.06_, _Section
11.07_, _Section 11.08_,  _Section 11.09_ and _Section 11.11_, each of
which will survive the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any fraud or
willful and material breach (except as otherwise provided in, and subject to
the limitations of, _Section 11.04(b)_) of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement. For purposes hereof,
"willful and material breach" means a material breach by a party of the
applicable provision of this Agreement as a result of an action or failure to
act by such Person that it knew would result in a breach of this Agreement.

privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the

remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 11.04. _Expenses; Termination Fees_ _._ (a) _General_. Except as
otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

 

(b) _Termination Fees_.

(i) _Company Termination Fee_. The Company agrees to pay a fee (the " _Company
Termination Fee_ ") to Parent in the amount of:

 

(A) $10,200,000, if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)(i)_;

 

(B) $10,200,000, if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(i)_ or _(iv)_ ;

 

(C) $10,200,000, if (x) the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement
pursuant to (A) _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ (but solely if the Company
Stockholder Approval has not been obtained prior to such termination) or (B)
_Section 10.01(b)(iii)_ and (y) (A) prior to such termination (in the case of
termination pursuant to  _Section 10.01(b)(i)_) or the Company Stockholder
Meeting (in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(iii)_), a
Company Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed and not withdrawn and
(B) within 12 months following the date of such termination, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement providing for a Company Acquisition
Proposal or a Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of this clause (ii), each reference to " _15%_
" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a
reference to " _50%_ "); or

(D) $3,400,000 (reflecting a reasonable estimate of ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s
out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of third party
advisors to Parent and Merger Sub), overhead costs and charges and lost
opportunity costs expected to be incurred by Parent and Merger Subsidiary
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this
Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), if this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(iii)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Company Termination Fee will be payable by the Company pursuant to this 
_Section 11.04(b)(i)(D)_ if at the time of such termination the Company would
have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(ii)_.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company
pays the Company Termination Fee, then the termination of this Agreement in
the manner set forth in _Sections 11.04(b)(i)(A)_ , _(B)_ , _(C)_ or _(D)_
above and ParentÂ’s receipt of the Company Termination

 



70  Fee pursuant to this _Section 11.04(b)(i)_ and in accordance with (and
subject to) _Section 11.04(c)_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary against the Company and its Related Parties for
any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, and upon such receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee,
neither the Company nor any of its Related Parties will have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, in the event of a payment
of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section 11.04(b)(i)(D)_, to the
extent that a Company Termination Fee subsequently becomes payable under
_Section 11.04(b)(i)(C)_ (in which case the original Company Termination Fee
that was paid pursuant to  _Section 11.04(b)(i)(D)_ will be credited against
the subsequent Company Termination Fee payable under _Section 11.04(b)(i)(C)_
when ultimately paid).

 

(ii) _Parent Termination Fee_. Parent agrees to pay a fee (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ") to the Company in the amount of $15,600,000 if (A) the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(iii)_ or (B)
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ at a time
when the Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(iii)_.

Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_
and, at such time, all of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_ and
_Section 9.02_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied, other than the
condition set forth in _Section 9.01(e)_ (except to the extent that a breach
of any provision of this Agreement by the Company was the principal cause of
the failure of the condition in _Section 9.01(e)_ to be satisfied), Parent
will pay or cause to be paid to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds no later than three Business Days following such termination,
an amount equal to the Parent Reimbursement Amount (such payment, the "
_Expense Repayment_ "); provided, however, that no such Expense Repayment will
be payable by Parent if, prior to such termination pursuant to _Section
10.01(b)(i)_, Parent provides written notice to the Company that it is willing
to extend the Outside Date to a date not later than May 27, 2014 and continue
to comply with its obligations under  _Section 8.10_ in order to cause the
condition set forth in _Section 9.01(e)_ to become satisfied prior to such
extended Outside Date and the Company does not agree in writing to such
extension.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except for an
order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted
by _Section 11.13_ prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its
terms, (i) the CompanyÂ’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
this _Section 11.04(b)(ii)_, (ii) the CompanyÂ’s receipt of the Expense
Repayment pursuant to this _Section 11.04(b)(ii)_, (iii) any reimbursement
and expense obligations of Parent pursuant to _Section 11.04(d)_, and (iv)
the rights and remedies of the Company available under the Equity Commitment
Letter and the Guaranty will be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company
against Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Guarantor, any Non-Recourse Party (as
defined in the Guaranty) or any source of any Debt Financing (and any of
their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents)
for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated, any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or the
failure of the

 



71  transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, and upon
receipt by the Company of the Parent Termination Fee or the Expense Repayment,
as applicable, none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Guarantor, any Non-
Recourse Party or any source of Debt Financing, or any of their respective
former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders,
managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents, will have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in respect
of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or equity in contract, in tort or strict liability,
by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable Proceeding, by
virtue of any law or otherwise. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
in no event will Parent or the Guarantor be subject to monetary damages in
excess of the Parent Termination Fee in the aggregate. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the Non-Recourse Parties (except to the extent expressly set
forth in the Guaranty or the Equity Financing Commitment) or the sources of
Debt Financing (or any of their respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
Affiliates or agents) will have any liability to any Person, including the
Company and its Subsidiaries, based on, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing or in respect of any other document or theory of
law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith or therewith under any theory whatsoever.

(c) _Payment of Termination Fees_. The payment of the Company Termination Fee
or the Parent Termination Fee (or the Expense Repayment described in the
second paragraph of  _Section 11.04(b)(ii)_), as applicable, will be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds by the Company or Parent, as
applicable, (a) within three Business Days following the termination of this
Agreement in the case of a termination in which amounts are payable pursuant
to _Section 11.04(b)(i)(A)_, _Section 11.04(b)(i)(D)_ or _Section
11.04(b)(ii)_, (b) prior to or concurrently with such termination, in the case
of a termination in which amounts are payable pursuant to _Section
11.04(b)(i)(B)_ (and any such purported termination will be void and of no
force and effect unless and until the Company makes such payment), and (c) the
earlier of the date on which the Company enters into a definitive agreement
providing for a Company Acquisition Proposal or the date on which a Company
Acquisition Proposal is consummated, in the case of a termination in which
amounts are payable pursuant to  _Section 11.04(b)(i)(C)_. For the avoidance
of doubt, subject to the last sentence of _Section 11.04(b)(i)_ any payment
to be made by any party under _Section 11.04(b)_ will be payable only once to
such other party with respect to _Section 11.04(b)_ and not in duplication
even though such payment may be payable under one or more provisions hereof or
on more occasion pursuant to the same subsection of this _Section 11.04_.

 

(d) _Other Costs and Expenses_. The parties hereto acknowledge that the
agreements contained in _Section 6.05_ and this  _Section 11.04_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay in a timely
manner the amounts due pursuant to this _Section 11.04_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or the Company makes a claim that results in a
judgment against the Company or Parent for the amounts set forth in this 
_Section 11.04_, the Company or Parent, as applicable, will pay to Parent or
the Company, respectively, the reasonable costs and expenses of Parent or the

 



72  Company, as applicable (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth
in this _Section 11.04_ at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made.

(e) _Other Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, but subject to the limitations on remedies set forth in _Section
11.13_, each party agrees that, prior to the termination of this Agreement or
the Effective Time, as applicable, the granting of a decree or order of
specific performance or other equitable relief will be its sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to breaches by the other parties to this Agreement and
that it may not seek monetary damages prior to the termination of this
Agreement or the Effective Time, as applicable, that may be available for
breach under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 11.05. _Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References_. The parties
hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in
the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other
representations and warranties of the Company that are contained in this
Agreement if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties is reasonably
apparent on its face. The inclusion of any information in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any Company SEC Document, as applicable, will not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material,
would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or is outside the
ordinary course of business.

 

Section 11.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_ _._ (a) The provisions of
this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except (i) as
provided in _Section 7.02_ with respect to Indemnified Persons, (ii)
_Section 11.03(a)_,  _Section 11.04(b)(ii)_ (but only the third paragraph
therein), _Section 11.06(a)_, _Section 11.07_, _Section 11.08_, _Section
11.09_ and _Sections 11.13(b)-(c)_ , with respect to the sources of Debt
Financing, (iii) _Section 11.04(b)(ii)_ (but only the third paragraph
therein) with respect to Non-Recourse Parties and the Guarantor, and (iv)
following the Effective Time, the right of the CompanyÂ’s former stockholders
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article 2_ hereof, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer, assign or
delegate its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from
time to time in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and
(ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such transfer, assignment or delegation will not relieve Parent or Merger
Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any
obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.
Any assignment or delegation in violation of the foregoing will be null and
void.

 



73 Section 11.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflict of laws rules of such state.

 

Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction_ _._ The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the financing commitments or the performance
thereof (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any
party or any of its Affiliates) will be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court
or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in
_Section 11.01_ will be deemed effective service of process on such party.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company agrees,
and agrees to cause its Affiliates to agree, (i) that any action of any kind
or nature, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
involving a source of Debt Financing in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be
brought exclusively in any New York State court or Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in New York County, (ii) to submit for itself and
its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts, (iii) not to bring or permit any of its Affiliates or
representatives to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such action in
any other court, (iv) that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to it at the address of the Company provided in
_Section 11.01_ hereof will be effective service of process against it for
any such action brought in any such court, (v) to waive and hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any
such court, (vi) that a final judgment in any such action will be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law, (vii) that any such action will be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, and
(viii) to irrevocably waive and hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in
any such action to the same extent such rights are waived pursuant to _Section

FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF. 

Section 11.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement will become

 



74  effective when each party hereto has received a counterpart hereof signed by
all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement will have
no effect and no party will have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by
virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).

Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Guaranty constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

Section 11.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties will negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Subject to _Sections 11.04_ and _11.13(b)-(d)_ , the parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Subject to _Sections 11.04_ and _11.13(b)-(d)_ , the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties will be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 11.13(a)_, the parties hereby further
acknowledge and agree that prior to the earlier to occur of the Closing and
the termination of this Agreement by the Company in accordance with its terms,
the Company will be entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent
and/or Merger Subsidiary to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity
Financing and to cause Parent or Merger Subsidiary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with _Section 2.01_, on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement, if, but only if, each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (A) all conditions in _Sections 9.01_ and _9.02_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived, (B) Parent and Merger Subsidiary fail to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
_Section 2.01(b)_, (C) the Debt Financing (or, if alternative Debt 

 



75  Financing is being used in accordance with _Section 7.06_, pursuant to the
alternative Debt Financing Commitments with respect thereto) has been funded
or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing, and (D) the Company has confirmed in an irrevocable written notice
delivered to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to the last
sentence of _Section 11.04(b)(ii)_, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that
the Company will be entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent and
Merger Subsidiary to enforce the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment,
including by demanding that Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary file one or more
lawsuits against the sources of Debt Financing to fully enforce such
sourcesÂ’ obligations thereunder and ParentÂ’s and Merger SubsidiaryÂ’s rights
thereunder, only in the event that each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_ and 
_Section 9.02_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, and Parent and Merger
Subsidiary fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to
have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ and (ii) all of the conditions
to the consummation of the financing provided by the Debt Financing Commitment
(or, if alternative Debt Financing is being used in accordance with  _Section
7.06_, pursuant to the alternative Debt Financing Commitments with respect
thereto) have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein will be deemed to permit the Company to seek specific performance
directly against the sources of Debt Financing under any theory whatsoever.

(c) Except to the extent otherwise set forth in the Equity Financing
Commitment or the Guaranty, and without limiting any other provision in this
Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or
causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may
only be made against the parties hereto.

 

(d) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.
