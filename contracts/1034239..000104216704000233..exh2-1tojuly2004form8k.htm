2004, is made by and among RC2 Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), RBVD Acquisition Corp., a Massachusetts corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _MergerCo_ "), and The First Years Inc., a
Massachusetts corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties wish to effect a business combination through a merger of
MergerCo with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Business
Corporation Law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the " _MBCL_ "), and
after July 1, 2004, the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_
");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously adopted and approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and determined that this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are advisable and in the best interest of the Companys
stockholders;

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and MergerCo have
determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are in the best interest of their respective
stockholders, and Parent has approved this Agreement as the sole stockholder
of MergerCo;

 



 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Parent and MergerCo to enter
into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Voting
Agreement Stockholders_ ") are simultaneously herewith entering into voting
agreements with Parent in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ "), pursuant to which each Voting
Agreement Stockholder has agreed, among other things, to vote his shares of
common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ," which term, as the context requires, shall be deemed to include the
rights (the " _Rights_ ") issued under the terms of the Company Rights

conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, MergerCo and the Company desire to make certain

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, the Company and MergerCo shall consummate the Merger
pursuant to which (a) MergerCo shall be merged with and into the Company and
the separate corporate existence of MergerCo shall thereupon cease, (b) the
Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and (c) the separate corporate existence of
the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in the MBCL, and after July 1, 2004, the MBCA. The purpose of the
Surviving Corporation shall be to manufacture, buy, sell and generally deal
in, at wholesale, infants and childrens toys, novelties and accessories,
including any and all articles used or capable of being used in connection
with said business or any part thereof, and in general, to carry on any
business or other activity which may be lawfully carried on by a corporation
organized under Chapter 156B, and Chapter 156D after July 1, 2004, of the
Massachusetts General Laws (the " _MGL_ ").

 



 

1.2 _Articles of Organization and By-Laws_. The Company shall take such
steps as are permitted under the MGL to (a) amend the Restated Articles of
Organization of the Company (the " _Articles of Organization_ ") so that the
Articles of Organization of MergerCo, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Organization of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Articles of
Organization, and (b) amend the By-laws of the Company (the " _By-laws_ ") so
that the By-laws of MergerCo, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by law, by the Articles of Organization of the Surviving
Corporation and by such By-laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the name of
the Surviving Corporation shall be "The First Years Inc." and the Articles of
Organization and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall so provide.

 



 

1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, MergerCo and the Company shall
duly execute and file articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with
the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in accordance with
the MGL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of
Merger, accompanied by payment of the filing fee (as provided in the MGL),
have been examined by and received the endorsed approval of the Secretary of
State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



    
--- 
    | 2 | 
   

* * *

  
   
 

1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall occur
as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the third Business Day)
after all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than conditions
which by their terms are required to be satisfied or waived at the Closing)
shall have been satisfied or, if permissible, waived by the party entitled to
the benefit of the same, and, subject to the foregoing, shall take place at
such time and on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_
"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 53
State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, or at such other place as agreed to
by the parties hereto.

 



 

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of MergerCo immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and the officers of MergerCo immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Articles of Organization and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCKOF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS 


 



 

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of MergerCo:

 



 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MergerCo
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation following the Merger.

 



 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or by Parent, MergerCo or any other
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive $18.60 per
share, net to the seller in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without any
interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender and exchange
of the Certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.1.

 



    
--- 
    | 3 | 
   

* * *

  
   
 

(d) All shares of Company Common Stock, when converted as provided in
Section 2.1(c), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate previously
evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration. The holders of Certificates previously evidencing
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Company Common Stock
except as otherwise provided herein or by law and, upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.1, shall only
represent the right to receive for their shares of Company Common Stock, the
Merger Consideration.

 



 

2.2 _Company Stock Options and Related Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each option (collectively, the " _Options_ ") granted under the 2002
Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan for Directors (the " _Director Plan_ ")
or the 2002 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (the " _Equity Plan_ ,"
and together with the Director Plan, the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ "),
which is outstanding (whether or not then exercisable) as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested as of the Effective Time or
earlier in accordance with the relevant Company Stock Option Plan. At the
Effective Time, upon the surrender and cancellation of the option agreement
representing such Option, the Company shall pay to the holder thereof cash in
an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock provided for in such Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share provided for in such Option,
which cash payment shall be treated as compensation and shall be net of any
applicable federal or state withholding tax. The Company shall cause all
Options issued pursuant to the Director Plan to terminate and cease to be
outstanding or of any force or effect immediately following the Effective Time
subject only to the right of each holder of an Option to receive the cash
payment to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.2(a). The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions, including
such actions as set forth in Section 2.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, necessary to ensure that all Options issued pursuant to the Equity
Plan, to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall terminate
and be cancelled immediately following the Effective Time and thereafter be of
no further force or effect.

 



 

(b) Parent and MergerCo acknowledge that all restricted stock awards granted
under the Company Stock Option Plans shall immediately vest and the
restrictions associated therewith shall automatically be deemed waived as
provided by the Company Stock Option Plans but in no event later than the date
on which the Companys stockholders approve this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE III 
PAYMENT FOR SHARES 

 



 

3.1 _Payment for Shares of Company Common Stock_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company as shall be mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the 

    
--- 
    | 4 | 
   

* * *

  
   
 

holders of shares of Company Common Stock for exchange through the Exchange
Agent, the aggregate Merger Consideration as provided pursuant to Section
2.1(c) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 (i) a
form of letter of transmittal reasonably acceptable to the Company which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Certificates.

 



 

(d) Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 3.1, each such
Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock held by Parent, MergerCo or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent,
in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company) shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration
relating thereto. If the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) is to
be delivered to any person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock surrendered therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition to such right to receive such Merger
Consideration that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person surrendering
such shares of Company Common Stock shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(e) Promptly following the date which is 180 days after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all cash,
Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the Merger, and
the Exchange Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a
Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock may surrender
such Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive in consideration
therefor the Merger Consideration relating thereto.

 



 

(f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of any shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

    
--- 
    | 5 | 
   

* * *

  
   
 

On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares
of Company Common Stock presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be surrendered and canceled in return for the payment of the
Merger Consideration relating thereto, as provided in this Article III.

 



 

(g) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates shall be liable to any person
in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



 

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue the Merger
Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 



 

(i) The Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of United States federal, state or local tax
laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, such amounts withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

ARTICLE IV

standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and each has all
requisite power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own,
lease and operate their properties and to carry on their businesses as now

business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.2 _Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action_. Each of
Parent and MergerCo has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and perform its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and

the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on behalf of the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board
of Directors of MergerCo and by the sole stockholder of MergerCo, and, except
as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no other action
on the part of Parent and MergerCo is necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery by Parent and MergerCo of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and MergerCo and, assuming due and valid authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the Company, is a valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and MergerCo, as the case may be, enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors rights and general principles of equity.

 



 

4.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except (1) for filings,

other applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, the
HSR Act, and state securities or state "Blue Sky" laws, (2) for filing of the
Articles of Merger and (3) as otherwise set forth in Section 4.3 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, none of the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by Parent or MergerCo, the consummation by Parent or MergerCo of the

of the provisions hereof will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provision of the organizational documents of Parent or the articles of
organization or bylaws of MergerCo, (b) require any filing with, notice by, or
permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any state, federal, county,
municipal, foreign or other government or governmental authority or by any
court of competent jurisdiction (a " _Governmental Entity_ "), (c) result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or MergerCo is a
party or by which either of them or any of their respective properties or
assets may be bound, or (d) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or MergerCo or any of their
properties or assets, excluding from the foregoing clauses (b), (c) and (d)
such filings, notices, permits, authorizations, consents, approvals,
violations, breaches or defaults which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, (i) prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger, (ii)
otherwise prevent or materially delay performance by Parent or MergerCo of any
of their obligations under this Agreement or (iii) have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) As of the date hereof and as of the Effective Time, except for (i)
obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation or
organization and (ii) this Agreement and any other agreements or arrangements

respects the financial position of Parent as of the respective dates thereof,
and each of the statements of income, retained earnings and cash flow included
therein fairly present in all material respects the results of operations
retained earnings or cash flow, as the case may be, of Parent for the
respective fiscal periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 



 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered at or prior to the
execution hereof to Parent and MergerCo (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_
"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and MergerCo as follows:

 



 

5.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Authority; Compliance with Law_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Except as
set forth in Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company is
duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing under the laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, lease
and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now conducted.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company Subsidiaries listed in Section 5.4 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company duly incorporated or organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has the requisite corporate power or other
power and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions
in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has no other Subsidiaries other than the Company Subsidiaries.

* * *

  
   
 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 5.1(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is in
violation of any order of any court, governmental authority or arbitration
board or tribunal, or any law, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
properties or assets is subject (including, but not limited to, the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ "), other Securities Laws, and the Listing
Standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.), where such violation, alone or
together with all other violations, would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have obtained all licenses,
permits and other authorizations and have taken all actions required by
applicable law or governmental regulations in connection with their businesses
as now conducted, except where the failure to obtain any such license, permit
or authorization or to take any such action, alone or together with all other
such failures, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) The Company has previously provided or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of the Articles of Organization and By-laws and the other
charter documents, bylaws, organizational documents and partnership, limited
liability company and joint venture agreements (and in each such case, all
amendments thereto) of the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

5.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and perform its obligations hereunder. Subject only to the approval of
this Agreement by the holders of the Company Common Stock, the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on behalf of the Company. In connection with the
foregoing, the Company Board has unanimously adopted and approved this
Agreement and approved the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
unanimously recommended that the Companys stockholders adopt and approve this
Agreement, and taken such actions and votes as are necessary on its part to
render the provisions of Chapter 110F of the MGL and all other applicable
takeover statutes inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements and
the Merger. In accordance with the applicable provisions of the MGL, the
stockholders of the Company are not entitled to appraisal or dissenters rights
in connection with transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement, assuming
due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and
MergerCo, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating
to creditors rights and general principles of equity.

 



 

(b) The Company Board has amended the Common Stock Rights Agreement, dated
as of November 19, 2001, between the Company and EquiServe Trust Company,
N.A., as Rights Agent thereunder (the " _Company Rights Agreement_ "), prior
to the execution of this Agreement so as to provide that (i) (A) neither
Parent nor MergerCo will become an "Acquiring Person" and (B) no "Stock
Acquisition Date" or "Distribution Date" (as such terms are defined in the
Company Rights Agreement) will occur, in each case, as a result of the
approval, execution and

    | 10 | 
   

* * *

  
   
 

delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) the Company Rights Agreement will terminate
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company Board has taken all other
action necessary so that the execution of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby does not and will not (x) cause any of
the Rights to become exercisable or redeemable or (y) enable or require the
Company to separate any Rights from the shares of Company Common Stock to
which they are attached.

 



 

5.3 _Capitalization_.

sale or resale of any of their securities under the Securities Act.

forth the name and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each
Company Subsidiary. All issued and outstanding shares or other equity
interests of each Company Subsidiary are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. There are not any existing options, warrants,
calls, subscriptions, convertible securities, or other rights, agreements or
commitments which obligate any Company Subsidiary to issue, transfer or sell
any shares of its capital stock. All issued and outstanding shares or other

Securities Act, the HSR Act, and state securities or state "Blue Sky" laws,
(2) for filing of the Articles of Merger and (3) as otherwise set forth in
Section 5.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Company, the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by the
Company with any of the provisions hereof will (a) conflict with or result in
any breach of any provision of the organizational documents of the Company,
(b) require any filing with, notice by, or permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any Governmental Entity, (c) result in a violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default

under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company is a party or by which it or any of its
properties or assets may be bound, or (d) violate any order, writ, injunction,
decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its
properties or assets, excluding from the foregoing clauses (b), (c) and (d)
such filings, notices, permits, authorizations, consents, approvals,

5.7 _SEC Reports_. 

 



 

(a) The Company has filed all required forms, reports and registration
statements with the SEC since December 31, 2000 (collectively, the " _Company
SEC Reports_ "), all of which were prepared in all material respects in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Securities Laws_ "). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports
(i) complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Laws and (ii) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets of the Company included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of its date and each
of the consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows of
the Company included in or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations, retained earnings or cash flows,
as the case may be, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein and
except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q
pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and normal year-end audit
adjustments which would not be material in amount or effect. No Company
Subsidiary is required to file any form or report with the SEC or any state
securities authority. The certificates of the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of the Company required by Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 of
the Exchange Act or 18 U.S.C. §1350 (Section 906 of SOX) with respect to the
Company SEC Reports, as applicable, are true and correct as of the date of
this Agreement as they relate to a particular Company SEC Report, as though
made as of the date of this Agreement. The Company has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures, has conducted the procedures in
accordance with their terms and has otherwise operated in compliance with the
requirements under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003, including
all notes thereto (the " _Company Balance Sheet_ "), and except as set forth
in Section 5.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent, or otherwise) that would be required
to be reflected on a balance sheet, or in the notes thereto, prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except (i) the obligation to pay any transfer fee
necessary to transfer and assign the Company licenses listed on Section 7.3 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) the obligations to pay fees and expenses
to the Companys attorneys, accountants and the Companys financial advisor
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and other expenses
incurred in connection with the Companys exploration of strategic
alternatives, (iii) for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business since December 31, 2003, that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) as
otherwise reflected in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement.

prior to the date of this Agreement or in Section 5.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (a) there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and (b) neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding order, writ, judgment,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Entity which, in the case of (a) or
(b), would, individually or in the aggregate, (i) prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger, (ii) otherwise prevent or materially delay
performance by the Company of any of its material obligations under this
Agreement or (iii) have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or set forth in Section 5.9
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2003 through the date
hereof, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their

the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (b) any material commitment,
contractual obligation (including, without limitation, any management or
franchise agreement, any lease (capital or otherwise) or any letter of
intent), borrowing, liability, guaranty, capital expenditure or transaction
(each, a " _Commitment_ ") entered into by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries outside the ordinary course of business except for Commitments
for expenses of attorneys, accountants and investment bankers incurred in
connection with the Merger; (c) any material change in the Companys
accounting principles, practices or methods; (d) any change in the financial
condition, results of operations, or business of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (e) any increase to, or establishment
of, any severance plan or agreement with any officer of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; or (f) except for normal increases in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice not exceeding $500,000 in the
aggregate, any increase in any manner of the compensation or fringe benefits
of any non-executive officer or employee or any payment of any benefit not
required by any Employee Program or arrangement.

 



 

5.10 _Taxes_. Except as set forth in Section 5.10 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (a) has
timely filed (or had filed on their behalf) all Tax Returns required to be
filed by any of them (after giving effect to any filing extension granted by a
Governmental Entity) and (b) has paid (or had paid on their behalf) all Taxes
as required to be paid by it, except, in each case, where the failure to file
such Tax Returns or pay such Taxes would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the most recent audited
financial statements contained in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 reflect, to the knowledge of the
Company, an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the
date of such financial statements in accordance with GAAP, whether or not
shown as being due

on any Tax Returns. To the knowledge of the Company, and except as set forth

Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and no requests for
waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending.

creditors rights and general principles of equity;

under such lease or sublease; and

 



 

(iii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has assigned,
transferred, conveyed, mortgaged, deeded in trust or encumbered any interest

repairmens liens and other Property Restrictions, if any, which, individually
or in the aggregate, are not material in amount, do not materially detract
from the value of, or materially interfere with, the present use of any of the
Company Properties subject thereto or affected thereby, and do not otherwise
materially impair business operations conducted by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and which have arisen or been incurred only in the ordinary
course of business or are set forth in the Companys financial statements

and (v) with respect to leaseholds any Encumbrances on the landlords fee

the Company or any Company Subsidiary from any Governmental Entity.

 



 

(c) To the knowledge of the Company and except as set forth in Section
5.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Company

this Section 7.5(a), the Company may furnish non-public information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person who made

the Companys stockholders under applicable law. In the event that the Company
Board makes such determination, the Company may enter into an agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, but only forty-eight (48) hours after Parents
receipt of written notice (A) advising Parent that the Company Board has
received a Superior Proposal and that the Company has elected to terminate

any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld); and _provided_ _further_ that the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-appealable,
that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 7.6, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify the Company and, after

(b) Parent and MergerCo agree that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of, each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary
and agent of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries provided for in the
respective charters or by-laws or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claims (each a " _Claim_ ") asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such Claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation also agree to indemnify
and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time to the extent provided in any written indemnification
agreements between the Company and/or one or more Company Subsidiaries and
such officers and directors as listed in Section 7.6(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance coverage for the Companys directors and
officers in a form acceptable to the Company which shall provide such
directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective
Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not
materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company, so
long as the aggregate cost is less than $750,000 (the " _Premium Limit_ "). In
the event that the Premium Limit is insufficient for such coverage, the
Company may enter into an agreement to spend up to that amount to purchase
such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force
and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) The obligations under this Section 7.6 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
Section 7.6 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 7.6 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.6 and shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained herein).

 



 

(e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.6.

 



 

7.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date hereof until
the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries and each of the Companys and Company Subsidiaries officers,
employees and agents to, afford to Parent and to the officers, employees and
agents of Parent access upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times without
undue interruption to (a) their properties, books, records and contracts;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall obtain the Companys consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, prior to any visit to any Company
property, and (b) the officers and key employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall obtain the
Companys consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, prior to
accessing any non-executive officer or key employee. The Company shall furnish
Parent such financial, operating and other data and information as Parent may
reasonably request to the extent such data or information is reasonably
available, including, but not limited to, information regarding the Companys
internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and
procedures. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and MergerCo shall hold in
confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in that certain confidentiality agreement between Parent and the
Company dated January 27, 2004 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

7.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be
required by law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation
system if the party issuing such press release or making such public statement
has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party and to
obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner.
In this regard, the parties shall make a joint public announcement of the
Merger contemplated hereby no later than (a) the close of trading on the
Nasdaq National Market on the date this Agreement is signed, if such signing
occurs during a Business Day or (b) the opening of trading on the Nasdaq
National Market on the Business Day following the date on which this Agreement
is signed, if such signing does not occur during a Business Day.

 



 

7.9 _Employee Benefit Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) On and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor in accordance with their terms all severance obligations
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary listed in Section 7.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, except as may otherwise be agreed to by the parties
thereto, and the Company or Parent shall pay on the Closing Date to the
applicable officers and employees listed in said Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, any amounts with respect to such severance obligations
that are payable by their terms upon consummation of the Merger, at the
Effective Time or on the Closing Date. Parent also agrees to fully vest all
benefits of participants in The First Years Inc. and its Affiliates Pension
Plan whose employment is terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
without "cause" or by such participant for "good reason" within twenty-four
(24) months following the Closing Date, without regard to any vesting
schedules set forth in such plan (as such terms are defined in Section 7.9 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule).

 



 

(b) Until December 31, 2004 or such later time as Parent shall determine
(the " _Transition Period_ "), Parent shall cause, and cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue the participation of employees of the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries who remain employed after the
Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") in the Employee Programs (other
than deferred compensation plans or stock option plans) on the same terms as
those currently in effect. As of the end of the Transition Period, the Company
Employees shall be permitted to participate in the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries on the same terms as similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and Parent may terminate any of the Company
employee benefit plans or merge any of the Company employee benefit plans with
Parents employee benefit plans as Parent deems appropriate. Parent shall
cause the applicable benefit plans to treat the service of Company Employees
with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries attributable to any period before
the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for other appropriate
benefits, including, but not limited to, applicability of minimum waiting
periods for participation. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall not,
and shall cause the Surviving

 

    
--- 
    | 29 | 
   

* * *

  
   

 

Corporation to not, treat any Company Employee as a "new" employee for
purposes of any exclusions under any health or similar plan of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for a pre-existing medical condition, and any
deductibles and co-pays paid under any of the Companys or any of the Company
Subsidiaries health plans shall be credited towards deductibles and co-pays
under the health plans of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to make appropriate arrangements
with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such results.

 



 

(c) After the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor
all obligations which accrued prior to the Effective Time under the Companys
deferred compensation plans, supplemental retirement plans, management
incentive plans and long-range incentive plans. Except as is otherwise
required by the existing terms of the written employment and severance
agreements to which the Company is presently a party and listed in Section 7.9
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, future accruals may be (but are not
required to be) provided for under any such plan(s) or under any similar
plan(s) of the Surviving Corporation or Parent.

 



 

7.10 _Required Financing_. Each of Parent and MergerCo hereby agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the financing in respect of the
Merger and to satisfy the conditions set forth in the Financing Letters.
Parent will provide the Company any amendments to the Financing Letters as
promptly as possible (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours). Parent
and MergerCo shall keep the Company informed of the status of their financing
arrangements for the Merger, including providing written notification to the
Company as promptly as possible (but in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours) with respect to (a) any indication that any of the Lenders may be
unable to provide the financing as contemplated by the Financing Letters, (b)
the ability of Parent or MergerCo to satisfy any of the conditions set forth
in the Financing Letters, and (c) any adverse developments relating to the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letters. Parent shall provide written
notice to the Company within twenty-four (24) hours if any Lender has
indicated to Parent or MergerCo that such Lender will be unable to provide the
financing contemplated by the applicable Financing Letter or if any other
event occurs which is reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay Parent
or MergerCo from obtaining the proposed financing with respect to the Merger
(a " _Parent Financing Notice_ "). In the event Parent and MergerCo are unable
to arrange any portion of such financing in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Letters, Parent and MergerCo shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange any such portion from alternative sources
on substantially the same terms and with substantially the same conditions as
the portion of the financing that Parent and MergerCo were unable to arrange.

determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing upon any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) or Section 9.1(d)(ii) in
circumstances where the Liquidated Amount is payable in accordance with
Section 9.2(b), the rights to payment under Section 9.2(b): (i) constitute a

or Section 9.1(d)(ii) and (ii) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of
any and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing. Except for
nonpayment of the amounts set forth in Section 9.2(b), Parent and MergerCo
hereby agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section

any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers,
members or stockholders, and (B) be entitled to seek or obtain any other
damages of any kind, including, without limitation, consequential, indirect or
punitive damages.

approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by
stockholders without obtaining such approval.

 



 

9.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to

those rights.
