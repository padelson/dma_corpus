Such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any interest, dividends or distributions with respect thereto (as provided in _Section 2.5(c)_) and such cash, are referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions consistent with the terms of this Agreement given on the Closing Date, shall deliver the Parent Common Stock and the cash portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued or paid pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)(i)_ and _Section 2.4(c)(iv)_ as well as cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.5(e)_ out of the Exchange Fund, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose whatsoever; _provided_ that the Exchange Agent shall invest or hold the Exchange Fund only in cash or direct, short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in each case as directed by Parent and acceptable to the Exchange Agent; _provided, however_ , that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of the Company Securities and following any losses, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Company Securities in the amount of any such losses to the extent necessary to pay the Merger Consideration to such holders. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect thereto after the establishment of such Exchange Fund for the account of Persons entitled thereto. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. 

   

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock, a letter of transmittal (in customary form and reasonably acceptable to the Company) to be used to effect the exchange of such Company Certificate for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate, along with instructions for using such letter of transmittal to effect such exchange. The letter of transmittal (or the instructions thereto) shall specify that delivery of any Company Certificate shall be effected, and risk of loss and title thereto 

   ##### 

  

    

shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company Certificate to the
Exchange Agent. Such letter of transmittal shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify. 

   

 (ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company Certificate for cancellation, together with a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other documents that may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent: (A) the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a Parent Certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, and the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i) and Section 2.4(c)(iv), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 2.5(e), and any unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(c) (all after giving effect to any required withholding of Taxes); and (B) the Company Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Company Certificates. 

   

 (iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock (along with any cash in lieu of fractional  shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive under this Agreement) may be issued or paid to a transferee if the Company Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, including such signature guarantees as Parent or the Exchange Agent may request, and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. 

   

 (iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.5(b)_, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of a Company Certificate and execution of such other documents as the Exchange Agent may require, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate as provided in _Section 2.4(c)(i)_ and _Section 2.4(c)(iv)_ (along with any cash in lieu of fractional  shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) or the right to demand to be paid the amount determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 2.4(c)(v)_. 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock declared or made after the Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable Law: (i) at the time of the surrender of a Company Certificate for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.5_, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions (having a record date after the Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date on or prior to surrender) not theretofore paid with respect to the number of whole 

   ##### 

  

    

shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive (less
the amount of any withholding Taxes that may be required with respect
thereto); and (ii) at the appropriate payment date and without duplicating
any payment made under clause (i) above, there shall be paid to
the surrendering holder, without interest, the amount of dividends or other
distributions (having a record date after the Effective Time but on or prior
to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender) payable with respect
to the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder
receives (less the amount of any withholding Taxes that may be required with
respect thereto). 

  

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a Company Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any reason, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Section 2.5_. 

  

 (e) _Treatment of Fractional Shares_. No Parent Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger and, except as provided in this  _Section 2.5(e)_, no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest shall relate to any such fractional share, and such fractional share shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all Company Certificates delivered by or on behalf of such holder), such holder, upon surrender of a Company Certificate as described in this _Section 2.5_, shall be paid an amount in cash to the nearest whole cent (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, in which case Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, in addition to any other cash being provided to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ , the amount of cash necessary to make such payments. The Parties acknowledge that payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained for consideration but represents merely a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund and cash held by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.5_ that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company as of the date that is twelve months following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand. Thereafter, any former stockholders of the Company, other than those exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as provided in _Section 2.4(c)(v)_, who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this _Section 2.5_ shall look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger 

   ##### 

  

    

Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock (all
without interest). 

  

 (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (h) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Company Certificates_. If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any Claims that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the Merger Consideration (along with any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.5(e)_ and any unpaid dividends and distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_, without interest) deliverable with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.6 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (a) at the offices of Andrews Kurth LLP, 600 Travis, Suite 4200, Houston, Texas 77002 as soon as practicable after 10:00 a.m., local time, on the first Business Day immediately following the day on which all of the conditions set forth in Article 6 have been satisfied or waived (by the party entitled to waive the condition) (except for those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or (b) at such other time, date or place as the Parties may agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 Section 2.7 Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger shall become effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") at the time the Certificate of Merger is accepted for filing by the Delaware Secretary of State, or at such time thereafter as is permitted by law, agreed by the Parties and provided in the Certificate of Merger. At the Closing, the Certificate of Merger shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 2.8 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger under the DGCL as promptly as commercially practicable. In addition, the Parties agree to execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, real estate and other property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of either of Merger Sub or the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized, in the name of the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 2.9 Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld under the Internal Revenue Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment (including withholding shares of Parent Common Stock). Any such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

Parents disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such 

   ##### 

  

    

material information is accumulated and communicated to the management of
Parent as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of
SOX. The management of Parent has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents internal controls over financial reporting
in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the year ended
December 31, 2006, and such assessment concluded that such controls were

reporting and (B) any fraud, regardless of whether material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parents internal controls over financial reporting.

 Section 4.9 Absence of Certain Changes. Since December 31, 2006, there has not been (a) any Parent Material Adverse Effect, (b) any material change by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, when taken as a whole, in any of their accounting methods, principles or practices or any of their Tax methods, practices or elections, (c) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or distribution in respect of any capital stock or other Equity Interest of Parent or any redemption, purchase or other acquisition of any of its Equity Interests, or (d) except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, any increase in or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance, deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option, stock purchase or other employee benefit plan.

 (f) _Section 4.11(f)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate and complete list of each Parent Benefit Plan (and the particular circumstances described in this  _Section 4.11(f)_ relating to such Parent Benefit Plan) under which the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as termination of employment), result in, cause the 

   ##### 

  

    

accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value

such amendment or termination.

PBGC premium payments not yet due) or otherwise under Title IV of ERISA or
under the Internal Revenue Code with respect to any employee pension benefit

   ##### 

  

    

the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date hereof (including any amendments in effect through the

in full force and effect. The obligations of the financing sources to fund
the commitments under the Commitment Letter are not subject to any conditions

or default under the Commitment Letter by Parent, or if alternative financing
has been arranged by Parent, a breach of or default under the terms of such
alternative financing. Parent has paid any and all commitment fees and other
fees, in each case, required by the Commitment Letter to be paid as of the
date hereof. Parent has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would

has been arranged by Parent, any of the conditions set forth in such

Any information obtained by the Acquired Companies or Parent Companies or their respective Representatives under this Section 5.3 shall be subject to the confidentiality and use restrictions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.3_ to the contrary: (i) the Company shall not be obligated under the terms of this _Section 5.3_ to disclose to Parent or the Parent Representatives, or grant Parent or the Parent Representatives access to, information that is within the possession or control of any of the Acquired Companies but subject to a valid and binding confidentiality agreement with a Third Party without first obtaining the consent of such Third Party, and the Company, to the extent requested by Parent, will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consent; and (ii) Parent shall not be obligated under the terms of this  _Section 5.3_ to disclose to the Company or the Company Representatives, or grant the Company or the Company Representatives access to, information that is within the possession or control of any of the Parent Companies but subject to a valid and binding confidentiality agreement with a Third Party without first obtaining the consent of such Third Party, and Parent, to the extent requested by the Company, will use reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consent. 

  

 (f) No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other set forth in this Agreement, and no Party shall be deemed to have made any representation or warranty to the other Party except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.4 No Solicitation by the Company. 

  

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the first to occur of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_, except as specifically permitted in _Section 5.4(c)_, _Section 5.4(d)_ or _Section 5.4(e)_, the Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives will, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing or disclosing non-public information) any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute, or are reasonably likely to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, and upon becoming aware of any violation of this  _Section 5.4(a)(i)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, stop soliciting, initiating, encouraging, facilitating (including by way of furnishing or disclosing non-public information) or taking any action designed to facilitate, directly or indirectly, any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish or disclose any non-public information or data relating to the Acquired Companies to, or in response to a request therefor, give access to the properties, assets or books and records of the Acquired Companies to, any Person who has made or may be considering making a Company Acquisition Proposal or take any action which may otherwise lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Company Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, arrangement, understanding or other Contract relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Except as specifically permitted in _Section 5.4(c)_ and _Section 5.4(d)_, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any existing solicitations, discussions, negotiations or other activity with any Person with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal or which could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and shall inform its Subsidiaries and Representatives which are engaged in any such solicitations, discussions, negotiations or other activity of the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.4_. The Company shall promptly inform its Representatives who have been involved with or otherwise providing assistance in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.4_. The Company shall promptly demand that any Person (and the legal, financial or other representatives of any such Person) who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with or for the benefit of any of the Acquired Companies with respect to such Persons consideration of a possible Company Acquisition Proposal promptly return or destroy (and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such destruction to be certified in writing by any such Person to the Company) all confidential information heretofore furnished by the Acquired Companies or any of their legal, financial or other representatives to such Person or any of its legal, financial or other representatives in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality agreement with such Person. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the Confidentiality Agreement, prior to obtaining the Required Company Vote, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from: 

   

 (i) after the date of this Agreement, engaging in discussions or negotiations with, furnishing or disclosing any information or data relating to the Acquired Companies to, or in response to a request therefor, giving access to the properties, assets or books and records of the Acquired Companies to, any Person who has made an unsolicited, bona fide, written Company Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that did not result from a violation by the Acquired Companies of this _Section 5.4_; _provided, however_ , that prior to engaging in discussions or negotiations with, furnishing or disclosing any information or data relating to the Acquired Companies to, or giving access to the properties, assets or books and records of the Acquired Companies to, such Person, (A) the Company Board, acting in good faith, has determined (I) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors and based on such other matters as it deems relevant, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Company Superior Proposal and (II) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and (B) the Company (I) enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person with use and disclosure limitations, "standstill" provisions and other material terms that are no more favorable to such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (II) has complied with  _Section 5.4(d)_; and 

   

 (ii) subject to compliance by the Company with _Section 5.4(e)_, (A) withdrawing (or amending or modifying in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly proposing to withdraw (or to amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the 

   ##### 

  

   

approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
or any committee thereof (as the case may be) of this Agreement, the Merger
or the transactions contemplated hereby (the actions referred to in this
clause (A) being collectively referred to herein as a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Change"), (B) recommending, adopting, approving or
submitting to its stockholders, or proposing publicly to recommend, adopt,
approve or submit to its stockholders, any Company Acquisition Proposal (the
actions referred to in this clause (B) being collectively referred to as a
"Company Acquisition Proposal Recommendation"), or (C) entering into any
agreement, including any agreement in principle, letter of intent or
understanding, acquisition or merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar agreement, arrangement or
understanding which constitutes, relates to, is intended to lead to or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than
a Confidentiality Agreement contemplated by _Section 5.4(c)(i)(B)(I)_) (each
a "Company Acquisition Agreement"); _provided, however_ , that in any case,
the Company Board, acting in good faith, has previously determined, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; and  _provided,
further_ , that in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal Recommendation
or an entry into a Company Acquisition Agreement, (X) the Company Board,
acting in good faith, has previously determined, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors and based on such other matters
as it deems relevant, that such Company Acquisition Proposal or Company
Acquisition Agreement constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (Y) the
Company concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to and after complying
with the provisions of _Article 7_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that a Company Adverse Recommendation Change may or may
not involve a Company Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (d) If the Company or any Company Representative receives a request for information from a Person who has made an unsolicited, bona fide, written Company Acquisition Proposal, and the Company is permitted to provide such Person with information pursuant to this _Section 5.4_, the Company will provide to Parent a copy of the confidentiality agreement with such Person promptly upon its execution and provide to Parent a list of, and copies of, all information provided to such Person as promptly as practicable after its delivery to such Person and promptly provide Parent with access to all information to which such Person was provided access, in each case only to the extent not previously provided to Parent. The Company shall promptly provide notice to Parent, in writing, of the receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal (but in no event more than forty-eight hours after the receipt thereof), which notice shall include the identity of the Person or group requesting such information or making such inquiry or Company Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies of any written changes to any Company Acquisition Proposal, with written notice of material changes in the status of any Company Acquisition Proposal (including proposed changes to the status) and with written notice of any changes in the price, form of consideration, timing of payment thereof or any other material terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with written notice of the substance of any oral communications concerning material terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide 

   ##### 

  

 

Parent, upon receipt or delivery thereof, with copies of all
material correspondence or other material documents sent or provided to the
Company by any Person in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal or
sent or provided to any Person by the Company in connection with any Company
Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company Board shall not (x) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (y) make a Company Acquisition Proposal Recommendation or (z) enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal, unless: 

   

 (i) The Company complies with the terms of _Section 5.4(c)(ii)_ and  _Section 5.4(d)_; and 

   

 (ii) Promptly upon a determination by the Company Board that a Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the Company immediately notifies, in writing, Parent of such determination and describes in reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Company Superior Proposal. Parent shall have four Business Days after delivery of such written notice to submit an offer to engage in an alternative transaction or to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Company may proceed with this Agreement (a " _Parent Revised Offer_ "). During such four Business Day period, the Company and its financial and legal advisors shall negotiate in good faith exclusively with Parent to enable Parent to submit a Parent Revised Offer. Any amendment to the price or any other material term of a Company Superior Proposal shall require a new notice from the Company and an additional three Business Day period within which Parent may negotiate a Parent Revised Offer. For the avoidance of doubt, the four Business Day period and additional three Business Day periods, if any, referred to in this _Section 5.4(e)(ii)_ are the same periods referenced in _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable Law. 

  

 (g) All notices to be given by the Parties under this _Section 5.4_ shall be given by facsimile transmission in accordance with _Section 8.3_ (which notice shall be effective as of the day of transmission if transmitted on or before 5:00 p.m. U.S. Central Standard Time on the date of transmission, otherwise the next day after transmission). 

  

 Section 5.5 Stockholders Meetings. Promptly after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, each of Parent and the Company shall take all necessary action, in accordance with applicable Law, the rules and regulations of the NYSE or the Nasdaq (as the case may be) and the Parent Charter Documents or Company Charter Documents (as the case may be), to properly give notice of and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting on the Parent Proposal or the Company Proposal (as the 

   ##### 

  

 

case may be). Subject to _Article 7_, Parent shall recommend approval of the
Parent Proposal, and subject to _Section 5.4_ and _Article 7_, the Company
Board shall recommend approval of the Company Proposal. Each of the Parent
Board and the Company Board shall take all lawful action to solicit such
approval, including timely mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the
stockholders of Parent and the Company. The Company and Parent shall
coordinate and cooperate with respect to the timing of their respective
stockholder meetings and use reasonable best efforts to hold such meetings on
the same day and within 45 days after the date the Registration Statement is
declared effective; _provided, however_ , that the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Meeting (A) for the absence of a quorum or (B) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company believes in good faith is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior
to the Company Meeting; _provided, further_ , that in the event that the
Company Meeting is delayed to a date after the Termination Date as a result
of either (A) or (B) above, then the Termination Date shall be extended to
the fifth Business Day after such Company Meeting date. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, (i) the Company shall submit this
Agreement to its stockholders for approval regardless of whether the Company
Board withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation and declaration
regarding the Company Proposal and (ii) the Parent Board shall submit the
Parent Proposal to its stockholders for approval regardless of whether the
Parent Board withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation and
declaration regarding the Parent Proposal. 

   

 Section 5.6 Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus. 

  

 (a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate and promptly prepare the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall file the Registration Statement in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus with the SEC as soon as practicable after the date hereof and in any event not later than 60 days after the date hereof. Each Party shall give the other Party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to such documents being filed with the SEC or disseminated to stockholders of the Company or Parent and shall give the other Party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for additional information and comments from the SEC prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after filing. Parent and the Company will provide each other with any information which may be required to prepare and file the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement. Each of Parent and the Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, Parent or the Company, as applicable, will as promptly as reasonably practicable inform the other of such occurrence, and Parent and the Company will cooperate in filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC, use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause such amendment to become effective as promptly 

   ##### 

  

 

as possible and, if required, mail such amendment or supplement to their
respective stockholders. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, and
the Company shall cooperate with Parent, to obtain any and all necessary
state securities Laws or "blue sky" permits, approvals and registrations in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. 

   

 (b) Parent will cause the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and the Company shall be responsible for furnishing to Parent true, accurate and complete information relating to the Company and holders of Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options as is required to be included therein. 

  

 (c) The Company hereby covenants and agrees with Parent that: (i) the Registration Statement (at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act through the Effective Time) will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading ( _provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (i) shall apply only to information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement that was supplied by the Company for inclusion therein); and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (at the time it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Company Meeting, and at the Effective Time) will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading ( _provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (ii) shall apply only to information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that was supplied by the Company for inclusion therein). If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with respect to the Company, or with respect to other information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, occurs and such event is required to be described in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such occurrence and shall cooperate with Parent in the preparation, filing an dissemination of such amendment or supplement. 

  

 (d) Parent hereby covenants and agrees with the Company that: (i) the Registration Statement (at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act and until the Effective Time) will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading ( _provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (i) shall not apply to any information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement that was supplied by the Company for inclusion therein); and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (at the time it is first mailed to stockholders of Parent, at the time of the Parent Meeting, and at the Effective Time) will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading ( _provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (ii) shall not apply to any information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that was supplied by the Company for inclusion therein). If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with respect to Parent, or with respect to other information included in the Registration Statement, occurs and such event is required to be described in an amendment to the Registration Statement, such event 

   ##### 

  

 

shall be so described and such amendment shall be promptly prepared and
filed. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with respect to
Parent, or with respect to other information included in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, occurs and such event is required to be described in a
supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall promptly notify
the Company of such occurrence and shall cooperate with the Company in the
preparation, filing and dissemination of such supplement. 

   

 (e) None of the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto will be filed or disseminated to the stockholders of the Company without the approval of both Parent and the Company. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, the issuance of any stop order with respect to the Registration Statement, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any comments or requests for additional information by the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement. 

  

 (f) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Parent two comfort letters from Grant Thornton LLP, Companys independent auditors, one dated on the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective, and one bring-down letter dated on the Closing Date, each addressed to the Parent and customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent auditors in connection with public offerings. 

  

 (g) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company two comfort letters from UHY LLP, Parents independent auditors, one dated on the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective, and one bring-down letter dated on the Closing Date, each addressed to the Company and customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent auditors in connection with public offerings. 

  

 Section 5.7 NYSE Listing. Parent shall prepare and submit to the NYSE, as soon as practicable, a listing application covering the shares of Parent Common Stock representing Parent Stock Consideration to be issued in the Merger and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for the listing of such Parent Common Stock, subject to official notice of issuance, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent with respect to such listing, in order to facilitate obtaining such approval as soon as practicable. 

  

 Section 5.8 Additional Arrangements. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the Company and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all action and shall do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or desirable under any applicable Law (including the HSR Act) or under applicable Contracts so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals, remove all impediments to the Closing, and make all Parent Regulatory Filings and Company Regulatory Filings (the " _Regulatory Filings_ "). Parent and the Company each will cause all documents it is responsible for filing with any Governmental Authority under this _Section 5.8_ to comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish the other Party with such information and reasonable assistance as such other Party and its respective affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of any Regulatory Filings with any Governmental Authorities;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the provisions of the HSR Act would prevent a Party from disclosing such information to the other Party, then such information may be disclosed to such Partys counsel. 

  

 (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all action or shall do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or desirable to cause the covenants and conditions applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby to be performed or satisfied as soon as practicable, including responding promptly to requests for additional information made by the DOJ or the FTC, and to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date after the date of filing. 

  

 (d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, Order, ruling or injunction that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Furthermore, if any Governmental Authority shall have issued any Order, decree, ruling or injunction, or taken any other action, that would have the effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting, delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such Order, decree, ruling or injunction or other action declared ineffective as soon as practicable. 

  

 (e) Parent and the Company shall promptly notify each other of any communication concerning this Agreement or the Merger from any Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable Law, permit the other Party to review in advance any proposed communication to any Governmental Authority concerning this Agreement or the Merger. In addition, Parent and Company shall not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or another inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger, or enter into any agreements with any Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, extending any antitrust waiting periods, unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Parent and the Company shall furnish counsel to the other Party with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authorities or members of their respective staffs on the other hand, relating to this Agreement and the Merger. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as provided in _Section 5.1_ and  _5.2_ , nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed so as to require Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, without its written consent, to sell, license, dispose of, hold separate, or operate in any specified manner any assets or businesses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or to require Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to agree to any of the foregoing). The obligations of each Party under this _Section 5.8_ to use reasonable best efforts with respect to antitrust matters shall be limited to compliance with the reporting provisions of the HSR Act and with its obligations under this _Section 5.8_. In connection with its 

   ##### 

  

 

obligations under this _Section 5.8_, the Company shall not, without Parents
prior written consent, commit to (or allow its Subsidiaries to commit to) any
divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters,
including covenants affecting business operating practices in connection with
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.9 Section 16\. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall adopt resolutions consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC and take any other actions as may be required, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Except as may be required by applicable Law, Order or any listing agreement with or rule of any regulatory body, national securities exchange or association, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release, making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) No Party shall issue any press release or other public statement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without first providing the other Parties with a written copy of the text of such release or statement and obtaining the consent of the other Parties to such release or statement, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The consent provided for in this _Section 5.10(b)_ shall not be required if the delay would preclude the timely issuance of a press release or public statement required by law or any applicable regulations. The provisions of this _Section 5.10(b)_ shall not be construed as limiting the Parties from communications consistent with the purposes of this Agreement, including but not limited to seeking the regulatory and stockholder approvals contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.11 Notification of Certain Matters. 

  

 (a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub of any of the following: (i) any representation or warranty contained in _Article 3_ being untrue or inaccurate when made, (ii) the occurrence of any event or development that would cause (or could reasonably be expected to cause) any representation or warranty contained in _Article 3_ to be untrue or inaccurate at any time on or before the Closing Date, or (iii) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any of the following: (i) any representation or warranty contained in _Article 4_ being untrue or inaccurate when made, (ii) the occurrence of any event or development that would cause (or could reasonably be expected to cause) any representation or warranty contained in _Article 4_ to be untrue or inaccurate at any time on or before the Closing Date, or (iii) any failure of Parent to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. 

  

 Section 5.12 Payment of Expenses. Except as provided in _Section 7.3_, each Party shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated, except that Parent and the Company shall equally share the following: (i) all fees and expenses, other than attorneys, accountants, financial advisors and consultants fees and expenses (which shall be paid by the Party incurring same), incurred for printing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including preliminary materials related thereto, and the Registration Statement, including financial statements and exhibits and any amendments and supplements thereto, and (ii) the filing fees for the Notification and Report Forms filed with the FTC and DOJ under the HSR Act. 

  

 Section 5.13 Indemnification and Insurance. 

  

 (a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company Charter Documents and Company Subsidiary Charter Documents in effect as of the date hereof or in any indemnification agreements between the Acquired Companies and their respective current or former directors, officers, fiduciaries, agents or employees in effect as of the date hereof (which have previously been provided to Parent). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were current or former directors, officers, agents, fiduciaries or employees of the Acquired Companies unless such amendment, repeal or modification is required by applicable Law, and all rights to indemnification thereunder in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition or resolution of such Claim. 

  

 (b) During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is as of the date hereof, has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or becomes prior to the Effective Time a director, officer, fiduciary, agent or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such person, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _Claim_ "), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission in his or her capacity as such occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including any act or omission in connection with the approval of this Agreement 

   ##### 

  

 

and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Indemnified
Party shall also be entitled to advancement of expenses as incurred (and not
later that ten Business Days after receipt by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation of receipts therefor) to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, _provided_ that such Indemnified Party undertakes to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim for which indemnification
could be sought by any Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents. In the event of any Claim, any Indemnified Party wishing
to claim indemnification shall promptly notify Parent thereof ( _provided_
that failure to so notify Parent will not affect the obligations of Parent
except to the extent that Parent shall have been prejudiced as a result of
such failure) and shall deliver to Parent the undertaking contemplated by the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, but without any requirement for the
posting of a bond. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any Claim is
brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Party will cooperate reasonably with
Parent, at Parents expense, in the defense of such matter and (ii) Parent
shall have the right to control the defense of such matter and shall retain
only one set of legal counsel selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party (plus one local counsel, if necessary) to represent
all Indemnified Parties with respect to each such matter unless the use of
one counsel to represent the Indemnified Parties would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest, or the representation of all of the Indemnified
Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual differing
interests between them, in which case such additional counsel as may be
required (as shall be reasonably determined by the Indemnified Parties and
Parent) may be retained by the Indemnified Parties. Parent shall pay all

Parties. 

   

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers from insurance carriers with financial strength ratings equal to or greater than the financial strength rating of the Companys current insurance carrier and (ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 200% of current annual premiums paid by the Company in the aggregate for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such six year period as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by obtaining a six year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" insurance shall satisfy the provisions of _Section 5.13(b)_. 

    ##### 

  

    

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase such "tail" insurance,
at Parents expense, provided that the aggregate annual premiums for such
policies do not exceed the Maximum Amount, and such "tail" insurance shall
satisfy the provisions of _Section 5.13(b)_. 

   

 (d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or any of their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.13_. 

   

 (f) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.13_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 5.13_ applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. 

  

 Section 5.14 Employee Matters. 

  

 (a) Parent may, in its sole discretion, continue any Company Benefit Plan or employee policy or program in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a " _Pre-Merger Plan_ "), including but not limited to a 401(k) plan or medical plan, for any period of time after the Effective Time for the benefit of any Company Employees. To the extent Parent does not continue a Pre-Merger Plan applicable to a Company Employee, such Company Employee shall be eligible, subject to the provisions herein, to participate in any corresponding Parent Benefit Plan providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective Time (the " _Post-Merger Plans_ ") to the extent such Post-Merger Plan replaces coverage under such Pre-Merger Plan. For all purposes under such Post-Merger Plans, Parent will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, give Company Employees full credit for their years of service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the same extent recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary immediately prior the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting (excluding benefit accruals) under any such Post-Merger Plan. The value of the compensation and benefits provided under the Pre-Merger Plans or the Post-Merger Plans, as applicable in accordance with the foregoing, to Company Employees, taken as a whole, after the Effective Time through December 31, 2008, shall be substantially similar to the value of the compensation and benefits provided under the Company Benefit Plans to the Company Employees, taken as a whole, immediately prior to the Effective time, as determined by Parent in good faith after taking into account all facts and circumstances. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Post-Merger Plans to the extent coverage under such Post-Merger Plan replaces coverage under any Pre-Merger Plan; _provided, however_ , to the extent such 

   ##### 

  

 

Company Employee is not covered by a Pre-Merger Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time due to failure to satisfy the applicable waiting period, such
Company Employee shall be subject to the waiting time applicable to a Parent
Employee with respect to the corresponding Post-Merger Benefit Plan
that replaces such Pre-Merger Plan (giving full service credit for service by
such Company Employee with the Company in satisfying such waiting time);
_provided further_ , to the extent a Company Employee is covered by a Pre-
Merger Plan but does not satisfy the service requirements for the
corresponding Post-Merger Plan, the Post-Merger Plan may allow such Company
Employee to participate in such Post-Merger Plan to the extent permitted
under such Post-Merger Plan, as determined in good faith by Parent, or Parent
shall continue the Pre-Merger Plan for such Company Employee or
otherwise provide comparable substitute coverage; and (ii) for purposes of
each Post-Merger Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Post-Merger
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents to the
extent permitted under the Post-Merger Plans or otherwise required by
applicable Law, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Pre-Merger Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding Post-Merger Plan begins to be taken into
account under such Post-Merger Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Post-Merger Plan. 

   

 (b) Parent shall establish a severance plan, the terms of which (including maximum severance payments) have been agreed upon and are set forth in _Section 5.14_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, effective for no less than the period from the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the Company Employees indicated in _Section 5.14_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter. 

  

 Section 5.15 Company Board and Executive Officers. At or prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent written resignations of all members of the Company Board and all officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to be effective as of the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 5.16 Tax Matters. The Company shall provide Parent with a certification in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) that it is not a United States real property holding corporation. 

  

 Section 5.17 Continuing Obligation to Call, Hold and Convene Stockholders Meeting; No Other Vote. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the obligations of Parent or the Company (as the case may be) to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Meeting or Company Meeting (as applicable) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to it, or by any determination by the Company Board or the Parent Board (as the case may be) to modify, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the Merger. Other than in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.4_, the Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company Acquisition Proposal, or propose to do so.

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to execute and deliver any and all additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in the actions contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Parent agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement by written consent of stockholder in lieu of meeting in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub promptly (but not later than 72 hours) after execution of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. 

  

 Section 5.19 Control of Other Partys Business(a) . Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents operations or give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its respective operations. 

  

 Section 5.19 Agreements of Executive Officers and Directors. 

  

 (a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each executive officer and director of the Company to execute and deliver to Parent as soon as practicable and prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus a voting agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 5.20(a) to the effect that such executive officer or director shall vote any and all shares of Company Common Stock owned by him or her to approve the Company Proposal. 

  

 (b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each executive officer and director of Parent to execute and deliver to Parent as soon as practicable and prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus a voting agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 5.20(b) to the effect that such executive officer shall vote any and all shares of Parent Common Stock owned by him or her to approve the Parent Proposal. 

  

 (c) The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the consummation of the Merger constitutes a "change of control" of the Company with respect to (i) the Company Benefit Plans, (ii) the Company Incentive Plans, (iii) any awards or award agreements under the Company Incentive Plans, and (iv) all existing employment agreements between the Company and its employees, including but not limited to those set forth in _Section 5.20(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree and acknowledge that the amounts set forth opposite the names of the employees identified in _Section 5.20(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter are the amounts due to such employees pursuant to Section 6.3 (or, in the case of Kim Snell, Section 8.3) of their respective employment agreements with the Company and that such amounts will be paid to the designated employees at the Effective Time. Upon the effectiveness of an employees resignation pursuant to _Section 5.15_, such employee shall be released from all obligations under his or her employment agreement; _provided, however_ , that the employees mentioned in _Section 5.20(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter as having continuing non-competition obligations shall not be released from the non-competition obligations contained in their existing employment agreements with the Company, and accordingly, the Company shall cause such employment agreements to be amended, in form and 

   ##### 

  

 

substance approved in writing by Parent, to provide that such employees shall
continue to be subject to such existing obligations to not compete with the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for one year following the
Effective Time.

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties whether such delivery is by physical delivery or by means of a facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 Section 8.5 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement will be severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such term or provision valid and enforceable, provided that if such term or provision is incapable of being so modified, then such term or provision shall be deemed ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If 

   ##### 

  

    

any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

  

 Section 8.6 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents and instruments delivered by the Parties in connection with this Agreement): (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) except as provided in  _Section 5.13_ (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby) and _Section 5.14_ (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby) is solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, legal representatives and assigns and does not confer on any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.10_ without notice of liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. Without limiting the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the provisions of _Section 5.14_ are statements of intent, and no Company Employee or other Person shall have any rights or remedies with respect thereto (including any right of employment) and no Person is intended to be a Third Party beneficiary thereof. 

  

 Section 8.7 Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the Laws of the State of Delaware (including the Laws of Delaware with respect to statutes of limitation and statutes of repose). 

  

 Section 8.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such attempted assignment without such consent shall be immediately null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 8.9 Waivers. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any Party may, for itself only and to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive performance of any of the covenants or agreements, or satisfaction of any of the conditions, contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of such Party. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision 

   ##### 

  

    

hereof shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof. 

  

 Section 8.10 Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect following the execution of this Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference, and shall constitute a part of this Agreement for all purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that any standstill provisions contained therein will, effective as of the Closing, be deemed to have been waived to the extent necessary for the Parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Any and all information received by Parent and the Company pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the applicable terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.11 Incorporation. Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are attached to and by this reference incorporated herein for all purposes.

Accordingly, the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and its provisions in any action or proceeding instituted in any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at Law or in equity. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights, obligations and remedies created by this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights, obligations or remedies otherwise available at Law or in equity. Except as expressly provided herein, nothing herein will be considered an election of remedies. 

  

 Section 8.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 8.13_.

Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement referenced below. 

  

RECITALS 

   

 A. Parent, Elway Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Bronco have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated January 23, 2008 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into Bronco, with Bronco surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 B. As of the date hereof, Affiliate owns and has the present power and right to vote (or to direct the voting of) the number of shares of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of Bronco (the " _Bronco Common Stock_ ") set forth beneath the Affiliates name on the signature page hereto and identified as "Number of shares of Bronco Common Stock owned," as such shares may be adjusted by stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization or other change in the capital structure of Bronco affecting the Bronco Common Stock (such shares of Bronco Common Stock, plus any other shares of Bronco Common Stock the voting power over which is acquired by Affiliate and less any shares of Bronco Common Stock the entire beneficial ownership in which, including all voting rights with respect thereto, are disposed of by Affiliate, in each case during the period from and including the date hereof through and including the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, are collectively referred to herein as Affiliates " _Subject Shares_ "). 

  

 C. As an inducement to the willingness of Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement, and as an inducement and in consideration therefor, the Merger Agreement requires certain persons and entities, including Affiliate, to execute and deliver this Agreement prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Affiliate has agreed to enter into this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows: 

  

 1. Agreement to Vote the Subject Shares. Affiliate, solely in Affiliates capacity as a stockholder of Bronco, hereby agrees that during the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the termination of this Agreement (such period, the " _Voting Period_ "), at any and all meetings (or any adjournments or postponements thereof) of the holders of any class or classes of the capital stock of Bronco at which the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are considered, however called, or in connection with any and all written consents of the holders of any class or classes of the capital stock of Bronco relating to the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby, Affiliate shall vote (or cause to be 

  

Exhibit 5.20(a) - 1  ##### 

  

    

voted) Affiliates Subject Shares in favor of the approval and adoption of the
Company Proposal and the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Merger and
each of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (and any
actions required in furtherance thereof). Affiliate agrees not to enter into
any agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle or understanding with
any person that violates or could reasonably be expected to violate the
provisions and agreements contained in this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to prevent Affiliate from making a bona fide disposition of the entire
beneficial ownership in, including all voting rights with respect to, any or
all of the Subject Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement is
intended to constitute a voting agreement entered into under Section 218 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, for the duration of the
Voting Period. 

  

 2. Covenants. Except for pledges in existence as of the date hereof, Affiliate agrees that, except as contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, Affiliate shall not (a) grant any proxies or powers of attorney in respect of the Subject Shares, deposit any of Affiliates Subject Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any of Affiliates Subject Shares or (b) take any action that would have the effect of preventing, impeding, interfering with or adversely affecting Affiliates ability to perform Affiliates obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent Affiliate from assigning or transferring any Subject Shares beneficially owned by Affiliate to any trust, estate, family partnership, foundation (whether family, private or public) or other entity under Affiliates control or subject to the same ultimate control as Affiliate (each a " _Permitted Transferee_ ") if such Permitted Transferee agrees in writing to hold any Subject Shares subject to all of the provisions of this Agreement as Affiliate hereunder or making a bona fide disposition of the entire beneficial ownership in, including all voting rights with respect to, any or all of the Subject Shares. 

  

 3. Representations and Warranties of Affiliate. Affiliate hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows: 

  

 (a) Due Authority. Affiliate has the capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. If Affiliate is an entity, Affiliate is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and Affiliate has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by Affiliate have, if Affiliate is an entity, been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Affiliate, and, assuming its due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Affiliate, enforceable against Affiliate in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by equitable principles. 

  

 (b) Ownership of Shares. Affiliate owns and has the present power and right to vote (or to direct the voting of) the number of shares of Bronco Common Stock set forth beneath the Affiliates name on the signature page hereto and identified as "Number of shares of Bronco Common Stock owned." Affiliate has sole voting power and sole power of disposition, in each 

  

Exhibit 5.20(a) - 2  ##### 

  

    

case with respect to all of the shares of Bronco Common Stock set forth
beneath Affiliates name on the signature page hereto and identified as
"Number of shares of Bronco Common Stock owned," with no limitations,
qualifications or restrictions on such rights, subject only to applicable
securities laws and the terms of this Agreement and as otherwise noted on the
signature page hereto. Also set forth on the signature page hereto is (i) the
number of shares of Bronco Common Stock issuable pursuant to options to

Bronco Common Stock set forth beneath the Affiliates name on the signature
page hereto and identified as "Number of shares of Bronco Common Stock
owned," the Options and the Restricted Shares are all of the equity interests
in Bronco legally or beneficially owned by Affiliate. 

  

 (c) No Violations. (i) No filing with any governmental authority, and no authorization, consent or approval of any other person is necessary for the execution of this Agreement by Affiliate and the consummation by Affiliate of the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that nothing herein shall prevent Affiliates compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) and (ii) none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Affiliate or compliance by Affiliate with any of the provisions hereof shall (A) result in, or give rise to, a violation or breach of or a default under any of the terms of any material contract, understanding, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Affiliate is a party or by which Affiliate or any of Affiliates Subject Shares or assets may be bound, or (B) violate any applicable order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment, statute, rule or regulation which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect Affiliates ability to perform Affiliates obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Reliance by Parent. Affiliate understands and acknowledges that Parent has entered into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the covenants contained therein requiring the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Affiliate. 

  

 4. Miscellaneous. 

  

 (a) Affiliate Capacity. If Affiliate is or becomes during the term hereof a director or officer of Bronco, Affiliate does not make any agreement or understanding herein in Affiliates capacity as such director or officer. Affiliate executes this Agreement solely in Affiliates capacity as the record holder or beneficial owner of Affiliates Subject Shares and nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by Affiliate in Affiliates capacity as an officer or director of Bronco. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect the ability of a director or officer of Bronco to take any action as may be advisable or necessary in the discharge of his or her fiduciary duties as such director or officer, and without regard to whether he or she is, without limitation, (i) a trustee or co-trustee of one or more Affiliates, (ii) an officer, consultant or other representative of a trustee or co-trustee of one or more Affiliates, or (iii) a beneficiary of one or more Affiliates. 

  

 (b) Publication. Affiliate hereby permits Parent and Bronco to publish and disclose in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including all documents and schedules filed with the SEC) and in other filings with the SEC Affiliates identity and ownership of shares of Bronco

understandings pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Further Actions. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to do all things necessary to effectuate this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral and written, with respect thereto. 

  

 (e) Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their Permitted Transferees, heirs, estates and successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, without the prior written consent of each of the other parties. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any person, other than the parties hereto, any rights or remedies. 

  

 (f) Amendments, Waivers, etc. This Agreement may not be amended, changed, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified or terminated, except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by all of the parties hereto. 

  

 (g) Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 (h) Remedies Cumulative. All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such party. 

  

 (i) No Waiver. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance. 

  

 (j) Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION 

  

Exhibit 5.20(a) - 4  ##### 

  

    

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. 

  

 (k) Headings. The descriptive headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 (l) Counterparts; Facsimiles. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. A signature transmitted by facsimile or by electronic mail in "portable document format" shall be treated for all purposes by the parties hereto as an original and shall be binding upon the party transmitting such signature without limitation. 

  

 (m) Termination. This Agreement shall terminate, neither Parent nor Affiliate shall have any rights or obligations hereunder, and this Agreement shall become null and void and have no effect upon the earliest to occur of (i) the mutual consent of Parent and Affiliate, (ii) the Effective Time, or (iii) the effective termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms; provided, further, that termination of this Agreement shall not prevent any party hereunder from seeking any remedies (at law or in equity) against any other party hereto for such partys breach of any of the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 4(d), 4(e), 4(h) and 4(j) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

intent, agreement in principle or understanding with any person that violates
or could reasonably be expected to violate the provisions and agreements
contained in this Agreement or the Merger Agreement; _provided, however_ ,
that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent Affiliate from
making a bona fide disposition of the entire beneficial ownership in,
including all voting rights with respect to, any or all of the Subject
Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement is intended to constitute
a voting agreement entered into under Section 218 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended, for the duration of the Voting Period. 

  

 2. Covenants. Except for pledges in existence as of the date hereof, Affiliate agrees that, except as contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, Affiliate shall not (a) grant any proxies or powers of attorney in respect of the Subject Shares, deposit any of Affiliates Subject Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement with respect to any of Affiliates Subject Shares or (b) take any action that would have the effect of preventing, impeding, interfering with or adversely affecting Affiliates ability to perform Affiliates obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent Affiliate from assigning or transferring any Subject Shares beneficially owned by Affiliate to any trust, estate, family partnership, foundation (whether family, private or public) or other entity under Affiliates control or subject to the same ultimate control as Affiliate (each a " _Permitted Transferee_ ") if such Permitted Transferee agrees in writing to hold any Subject Shares subject to all of the provisions of this Agreement as Affiliate hereunder or making a bona fide disposition of the entire beneficial ownership in, including all voting rights with respect to, any or all of the Subject Shares.

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by Affiliate have, if Affiliate is an entity, been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Affiliate, and, assuming its due authorization, execution and delivery by Bronco, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Affiliate, enforceable against Affiliate in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by equitable principles. 

  

 (b) Ownership of Shares.

 (d) Reliance by Bronco. Affiliate understands and acknowledges that Bronco has entered into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the covenants contained therein requiring the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Affiliate. 

  

 4. Miscellaneous.

Affiliate executes this Agreement solely in Affiliates capacity as the record holder or beneficial owner of Affiliates Subject Shares and nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by Affiliate in Affiliates capacity as an officer or director of Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect the ability of a director or officer of Parent to take any action as may be advisable or necessary in the discharge of his or her fiduciary duties as such director or officer, and without regard to whether he or she is, without limitation, (i) a trustee or co-trustee of one or more Affiliates, (ii) an officer, consultant or other representative of a trustee or co-trustee of one or more Affiliates, or (iii) a beneficiary of one or more Affiliates.

 (i) No Waiver. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance. 

  

 (j) Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.
