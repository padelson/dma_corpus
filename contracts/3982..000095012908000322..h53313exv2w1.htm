satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. At the Effective

there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock that were

any such fractional share, and such fractional share shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled (after taking into
account all Company Certificates delivered by or on behalf of such holder), such holder, upon
surrender of a Company Certificate as described in this <U>Section&nbsp;2.5</U>, shall be paid an
amount in cash to the nearest whole cent (without interest) determined by multiplying (i)&nbsp;the
closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date by (ii)&nbsp;the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled, in which case Parent shall make available to the Exchange
Agent, in addition to any other cash being provided to the Exchange Agent pursuant to <U>Section
2.5(a)</U>, the amount of cash necessary to make such payments. The Parties acknowledge that
payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not
separately bargained for consideration but represents merely a mechanical rounding off for purposes
of simplifying the problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock.

Parent each registration statement, periodic or other report, proxy statement or information
statement (other than preliminary materials) it has so filed, each in the form (including exhibits
and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the &#147;<U>Parent Reports</U>&#148;). As
used in this <U>Section&nbsp;4.7</U>, the term &#147;file&#148; shall include any reports on Form 8-K furnished
to the SEC. As of its respective date, or, if amended by a subsequent filing prior to the date
hereof, on the date of such filing, each Parent Report complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations thereunder, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None
of the Parent Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC

to any comment letters received by the Parent from the SEC and, to the knowledge of Parent, none of
the Parent Reports is the subject of any ongoing review by the SEC. Each of the consolidated

position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders&#146; equity included in or incorporated by reference
