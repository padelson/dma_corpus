v _MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT_

 

MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
October 31, 2012, between Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (" _Buyer_ "), and Agrifos Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Seller_ ").

_SUMMARY OF TRANSACTION_

Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company
membership interests of Agrifos LLC (collectively, the " _Interests_ "), a
Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_ "). Buyer desires to
purchase, and Seller desires to sell, all of the Interests upon the terms and
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

For U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, the parties intend to treat
all consideration paid hereunder to Seller, including the Common Units and the
Supplemental Unit, as received from Buyer in exchange for the assets of the
Company Group in a transaction that is (a) part sale of such assets and (b)
part contribution of such assets in exchange for the Common Units and the
Supplemental Unit received in a non-taxable exchange pursuant to Section 721
of the Code at the Closing, even though the value of the Common Units to be
delivered in substitution for the Supplemental Unit may not be finally
determined until the occurrence of certain conditions and events after the
Closing.

 

To effect such transactions and in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements hereinafter set forth, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _SALE OF INTERESTS AND TERMS OF PAYMENT_

Section 1.01 _Sale of the Interests_. Upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing
Seller will sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer will
purchase and acquire from Seller, the Interests free and clear of all
Encumbrances.

 

Section 1.02 _Consideration_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions contained in this Agreement, in consideration of the
aforesaid sale, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Interests, Buyer will
pay or cause to be paid: (a) the Initial Purchase Price to be paid at the
Closing, plus the Post-Closing Addition or minus the Post-Closing Reduction
to be paid after the Closing in an amount determined pursuant to _Section
1.06_; and (b) the Supplemental Purchase Price which shall be initially
satisfied through the delivery of the Supplemental Unit at the Closing, and
which shall be subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions set

(ii) Common Units representing the Initial Equity Purchase Price (by delivery
of certificates) less the amount of Common Units delivered to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to _Section 1.04(a)_, and (iii) the Supplemental Unit (by
delivery of a certificate).

Section 1.05 _Characterization of Payments_. The payments made pursuant to
_Sections 1.04(a)_ and _1.04(f)_ shall be considered payments from Buyer to
Seller. The Company Group Closing Payment, as adjusted hereunder, shall be
considered payments on behalf of the Company Group and in respect of
obligations and liabilities of the Company Group.

Section 1.06 _Adjustment of Initial Purchase Price_.

(a)  _Adjustment at Closing_. In accordance with _Section 1.03_, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and a good faith
calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital based upon the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet, the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, the Estimated
Transaction Expenses and the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents, together
with reasonable supporting calculations and supporting documentation therefor.
The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied using the Company Accounting Principles; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event of a conflict between consistency with the
Company Accounting Principles and compliance with GAAP, except for the
Company Accounting Principles set forth in _Schedule_

 



3   _1.06(a)_ , compliance with GAAP shall control. Seller will consider in
good faith any revisions to the calculations set forth in the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet proposed by Buyer and the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet shall be modified accordingly to reflect any revisions agreed upon by
Buyer and Seller. At the Closing, as provided in _Section 1.02_, the Initial
Cash Purchase Price shall be determined in part by (i) reducing it by the
amount, if any, by which the Base-Line Net Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Net Working Capital, or (ii) increasing it by the amount, if any, by
which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Base-Line Net Working
Capital. The reduction in and addition to the Initial Cash Purchase Price
referred to in the preceding sentence are hereafter collectively referred to
as the " _Closing Reduction_ " and " _Closing Addition_ ," respectively. In
addition, as provided in _Sections 1.04(b)_ through _(e)_ , a portion of the
Initial Cash Purchase Price shall be used to make the Company Group Closing
Payment.

 

(b) _Final Closing Balance Sheet_. No later than one hundred twenty (120) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Seller the final Closing
Balance Sheet (the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and the calculations of
the Final Net Working Capital based upon the Final Closing Balance Sheet, as
well as the Final Closing Date Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses,
the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents and the Final Pension and Retiree
Liability. The Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied using the Company Accounting Principles; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that all accounts receivable amounts will reflect the
most recent information available regarding the value of receivables subject
to any provisional pricing arrangements; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
in the event of a conflict between consistency with the Company Accounting
Principles and compliance with GAAP, except for the Company Accounting
Principles set forth on _Schedule 1.06(a)_ , compliance with GAAP shall
control. The Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by a statement
(the " _Final Sales Statement_ ") of each Final Sale of ammonium sulfate that
was a Provisional Sale as of immediately prior to the Closing, including the
tonnage and Final Sales Price thereof. Additionally, Seller shall direct Buck
Consultants, LLC and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to prepare the calculation of
the Final Pension and Retiree Liability as of the Closing Date by Buck
Consultants, LLC updating the Pension Reports for the Pension Underfunding
and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP updating the Actuarial Valuation for the
Retiree Obligation, in each case, as of the Closing Date using the same
methodology as was used to prepare the Pension Reports and Actuarial
Valuation. Seller shall direct such firms to deliver such calculation to
Buyer and Seller no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing
Date. The Final Pension and Retiree Liability, as determined by Buck
Consultants, LLC and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties, absent manifest error. The cost of such updates
prepared by Buck Consultants, LLC and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall be paid
by Seller.

 

(c) _Review by Seller; Dispute Resolution_.

(i) Following receipt of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, Seller will be
afforded a period of sixty (60) days to review the Final Closing Balance Sheet
and the Final Sales Statement and the calculations of the Final Net Working
Capital, the Final Closing Date Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses
and the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents during which period Seller and its
advisors shall have the right to inspect the work papers generated by Buyer
in preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Sales
Statement and such

 



4  calculations and shall have reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to the Company Groups relevant personnel and to information, books and
records of the Company Group reasonably requested by Seller and relevant to
the Final Closing Balance Sheet, the Final Sales Statement and such
calculations. At or before the end of such 60-day review period, Seller will
either (A) accept the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Sales
Statement in their entirety, in which case Buyers calculations shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties, or (B) deliver to Buyer written
notice and a written explanation of those items in the Final Closing Balance
Sheet or Final Sales Statement which Seller disputes and the proposed
modification of such calculations, in which case only the items identified
shall be deemed to be in dispute and the other items shall be deemed to be
accepted; _provided,_   _however_ , that the only bases for objection with
respect to the Final Net Working Capital calculation shall be (1) non-
compliance with GAAP, the Company Accounting Principles or the provision
regarding accounts receivable amounts in  _Section 1.06(b)_, as applicable
and (2) computational errors. Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the
Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Sales Statement in their entirety,
and to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the Final Closing
Balance Sheet, the Final Sales Statement and Buyers calculations of the Final
Net Working Capital, the Final Closing Date Indebtedness, the Final
Transaction Expenses and the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents if it fails to
deliver such notice and explanation of any items it disputes at or before the
end of such 60-day review period. Within a further period of twenty (20) days
from the end of the aforementioned review period, the parties and
their accountants will attempt to resolve in good faith any disputed items.

(ii) Failing such resolution, either Seller or Buyer may refer the unresolved
disputed items for final binding resolution to the Dispute Accountants to
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Closing
Date Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses and/or the Final Cash and
Cash Equivalents. In making such calculations, the Dispute Accountants shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Final Closing Balance Sheet, the
Final Sales Statement or the calculations of the Final Net Working Capital,
the Final Closing Date Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses and/or the
Final Cash and Cash Equivalents as to which Buyer and Seller have disagreed
and shall be instructed that it may not resolve any amounts in dispute such
that the resolution is greater than the greatest amount proposed by the
parties or less than the least amount proposed by the parties. The Dispute
Accountants shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, within thirty (30) days of
reference of the matter to the Dispute Accountants, a report setting forth its
calculations, which shall be prepared in accordance with the standards set
forth in _Section 1.06(b)_. The decision of such Dispute Accountants will be
nonappealable and incontestable by the parties and will not be subject to
collateral attack for any reason. The cost of such review and report shall be
paid half by Buyer and half by Seller.

 

(iii) In the event the Dispute Accountants refuse the engagement under this
_Section 1.06(c)_, Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree on another
nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants having no material
relationship with the Company Group, Buyer or Seller (the " _Alternative
Dispute Accountant_ ") to resolve any disputes according to  _Section
1.06(c)_. If within thirty (30) days, Buyer and Seller fail to mutually agree
on an Alternative Dispute Accountant, Buyer and Seller shall thereafter
promptly cause the American Arbitration Association to appoint
the Alternative Dispute Accountant, and in making its determination with
respect to such appointment, the American Arbitration Association shall take
into account, and

 



5  attempt to avoid appointing an accounting firm with, any significant
preexisting relationship with the Company Group, Buyer or Seller or their
respective Affiliates. The fees and expenses of the Alternative Dispute
Accountant shall be apportioned in the same manner as described in _Section
1.06(c)(ii)_.

(d)  _Adjustment after Closing_. After the Closing, the Initial Seller Cash
Payment shall be (i) (A) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Net
Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, or (B)
increased by the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Working Capital is
greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, (ii) (A) reduced by the
amount, if any, by which the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents exceeds the
Final Cash and Cash Equivalents, or (B) increased by the amount, if any, by
which the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents exceeds the Estimated Cash and Cash
Equivalents, (iii) (A) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated
Closing Date Indebtedness exceeds the Final Closing Date Indebtedness, or (B)
reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Closing Date Indebtedness
exceeds the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, (iv) (A) increased by the
amount, if any, by which the Estimated Transaction Expenses exceed the Final
Transaction Expenses, or (B) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final
Transaction Expenses exceed the Estimated Transaction Expenses, and (v) (A)
increased by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Pension and Retiree
Liability exceeds the Final Pension and Retiree Liability, or (B) reduced by
the amount, if any, by which the Final Pension and Retiree Liability exceeds
the Estimated Pension and Retiree Liability. The aggregate net reduction in
or addition to the Initial Seller Cash Payment calculated pursuant to this
_Section 1.06(d)_ shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Post-
Closing Reduction_ " (in the case of an aggregate net reduction to the
Initial Seller Cash Payment) or as the " _Post-Closing Addition_ " (in the
case of an aggregate net addition to the Initial Seller Cash Payment).

 

(e) _Adjustment Payment_. After the Final Closing Balance Sheet, the Final
Sales Statement and the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital, the
Final Closing Date Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses and the Final
Cash and Cash Equivalents become final, conclusive and binding upon the
parties in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.06(c)_ and the Final
Pension and Retiree Liability becomes final, conclusive and binding upon the
parties in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.06(b)_, then:

(i) If any Post-Closing Addition is required, then Seller shall be entitled to
receive a disbursement in accordance with the Escrow Agreement of all Escrow
Funds in the Price Adjustment Escrow Account and Buyer will also pay Seller
the amount of the Post-Closing Addition in immediately available funds by wire
transfer made within ten (10) Business Days after the final determination of
the amount of the Post-Closing Addition pursuant to  _Section 1.06(d)_.

(ii) If any Post-Closing Reduction is required, then Buyer shall be entitled
to receive a disbursement in accordance with the Escrow Agreement from the
Price Adjustment Escrow Account in an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Reduction and, to the extent sufficient funds are not available therein,
Seller will pay to Buyer the amount of such deficiency in immediately
available funds by wire transfer made within ten (10) Business Days after the
final determination of the amount of the Post-Closing Reduction pursuant to
_Section 1.06(d)_ (or, at Buyers election, Buyer shall be entitled to
receive a disbursement in accordance with the

 



6  Escrow Agreement from the General Indemnity Escrow Account or Additional
Indemnity Escrow Account in an amount equal to such deficiency); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the amount of the Escrow Funds in the Price Adjustment
Escrow Account exceeds the amount of the Post-Closing Reduction, such excess
after payment of the Post-Closing Reduction to Buyer shall be disbursed to
Seller in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. 

Section 1.07 _Escrow_. On the Closing Date, as provided in _Section 1.04(a)_,
Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Price Adjustment Escrow Amount
into an escrow account (the " _Price Adjustment Escrow Account_ "), the
General Indemnity Escrow Amount into an escrow account (the " _General
Indemnity Escrow Account_ "), the Additional Indemnity Escrow Amount into an
escrow account (the " _Additional Indemnity Escrow Account_ ") and the Sales
and Use Tax Indemnity Escrow Amount in an escrow account (the " _Sales and Use
Tax Indemnity Escrow Account_ " and, together with the Price Adjustment
Escrow Account, the General Indemnity Escrow Account and the Additional
Indemnity Escrow Account, the " _Escrow Accounts_ "). The Escrow Agent shall
hold each Escrow Account separately from the other Escrow Accounts as
provided in the Escrow Agreement. Upon completion of such deposits, Buyer
shall have no further obligation to pay such amounts to Seller. The Escrow
Funds shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent as provided in the Escrow
Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall each pay half of all fees and expenses of
the Escrow Agent. Seller shall be considered the owner of Escrow Income that
constitutes taxable income for United States federal income and other Tax
purposes.

Section 1.08 _Supplemental Purchase Price_. In addition to the Initial
Purchase Price, as may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.06_, the
supplemental purchase price (the " _Supplemental Purchase Price_ "), if any,
shall be calculated in accordance with this _Section 1.08_.

 

(a) _Adjusted EBITDA Statement_. Buyer shall prepare unaudited financial
statements for the Operating Subsidiary attributable to its operations at the
Facility for each of the years ending December 31, 2013 and 2014 (the "
_Financial Statements_ ") based on the consolidating financial statements
Buyer uses to prepare its audited financial statements it files with the SEC,
including any relevant audit adjustments therein. The Financial Statements
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied using the
Company Accounting Principles; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in the event
of a conflict between consistency with the Company Accounting Principles and
compliance with GAAP, except for the Company Accounting Principles set forth
in _Schedule 1.08(a)_, compliance with GAAP shall control, (ii) where an
accounting or reporting matter may not be determined specifically by GAAP,
such as the allocation of certain expenses within the category of "costs of
products sold" or "cost of sales", (A) in the event that the
Operating Subsidiary applied a Company Accounting Principle prior to Closing
with respect to such accounting or reporting matter, such Company Accounting
Principle shall control if such Company Accounting Principle is not
inconsistent with GAAP; and (B) in the event that the Operating Subsidiary
did not apply a Company Accounting Principle with respect to such accounting
or reporting matter, the Buyer Accounting Principles shall control if such
Buyer Accounting Principles are not inconsistent with GAAP and (iii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any bonus payments
to employees of the Operating Subsidiary during the Earn-out Period will be
included in Actual SGandA Costs and not within any other category within
operating income in the Financial Statements. By April 30, 2015, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller the Financial Statements and a statement of the

 



7  cumulative Adjusted EBITDA (the " _Adjusted EBITDA Statement_ ") for the
Earn-out Period. An example of the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is set forth
in _Exhibit M_. The Adjusted EBITDA Statement also shall be accompanied by a
calculation of the amount of the Supplemental Purchase Price, if any. Subject
to _Section 1.08(d)_, the amount of the Supplemental Purchase Price shall
equal the product (which shall not be less than zero) of (1) (I) the
cumulative amount of the Adjusted EBITDA for the Earn-out Period, less (II)
Fifty Five Million Dollars ($55 million), multiplied by (2) two (2.0);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the amount of the Supplemental Purchase Price
shall not exceed Fifty Million Dollars ($50 million). As provided in _Section
1.08(c)_, the Supplemental Unit shall entitle Seller to receive the number of
Common Units corresponding to the Supplemental Purchase Price, if any.

(b) _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(i) Following receipt of the Adjusted EBITDA Statement, Seller will be
afforded a period of sixty (60) days to review the Adjusted EBITDA Statement
and the calculations of the Adjusted EBITDA, during which period Seller and
its advisors shall have the right to inspect the work papers generated by
Buyer in preparation of the Adjusted EBITDA Statement and such calculations
and have reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the Company
Groups relevant personnel and to information, books and records of the
Company Group reasonably requested by Seller and relevant to the Adjusted
EBITDA Statement and such calculations. At or before the end of such 60-day
review period, Seller will either (A) accept the Adjusted EBITDA Statement in
its entirety, in which case Buyers calculations shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties, or (B) deliver to Buyer written notice and a
written explanation of those items in the Adjusted EBITDA Statement which
Seller disputes and the proposed modification of such calculations, in which
case only the items identified shall be deemed to be in dispute and the other
items shall be deemed to be accepted; _provided_ , _however_ , that the only
bases for objection with respect to the Adjusted EBITDA calculation shall be
(1) non-compliance with GAAP or the Company Accounting Principles, as
applicable, or the definition of "Adjusted EBITDA" or the related defined
terms, (2) computational errors or (3) Buyers non-compliance with the last
sentence of _Section 1.08(f)_. Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the
Adjusted EBITDA Statement in its entirety, and to have agreed with all items
and amounts contained in the Adjusted EBITDA Statement and Buyers
calculations of the Adjusted EBITDA, if it fails to deliver such notice and
explanation of any items it disputes at or before the end of such 60-day
review period. Within a further period of twenty (20) days from the end of the
aforementioned review period, the parties and their accountants will attempt
to resolve in good faith any disputed items.

(ii) Failing such resolution, either Seller or Buyer may refer the unresolved
disputed items for final binding resolution to the Dispute Accountants to
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating the Adjusted EBITDA. In making such calculations, the Dispute
Accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in the Adjusted EBITDA
Statement or the calculations of the Adjusted EBITDA as to which Buyer and
Seller have disagreed and shall be instructed that it may not resolve any
amounts in dispute such that the resolution is greater than the greatest
amount proposed by the parties or less than the least amount proposed by the
parties. The Dispute Accountants shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, within
thirty (30) days of reference of the matter to the Dispute Accountants,
a report setting forth its calculations, which shall be prepared in
accordance with

 



8  the standards set forth in _Section 1.08(a)_. The decision of such Dispute
Accountants will be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties and will
not be subject to collateral attack for any reason. The cost of such review
and report shall be paid half by Buyer and half by Seller.

(iii) In the event the Dispute Accountants refuse the engagement under this
_Section 1.08(b)_, Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree on an Alternative
Dispute Accountant to resolve any disputes according to this _Section
1.08(b)_. If within thirty (30) days, Buyer and Seller fail to mutually agree
on an Alternative Dispute Accountant, Buyer and Seller shall thereafter
promptly cause the American Arbitration Association to appoint the Alternative
Dispute Accountant, and in making its determination with respect to such
appointment, the American Arbitration Association shall take into account, and
attempt to avoid appointing an accounting firm with, any significant
preexisting relationship with the Company Group, Buyer or Seller or their
respective Affiliates. The fees and expenses of the Alternative Dispute
Accountant shall be apportioned in the same manner as described in _Section
1.08(b)(ii)_.

 

(c) _Payment of Supplemental Purchase Price_. After the calculation of the
Adjusted EBITDA becomes final, conclusive and binding upon the parties in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.08(b)_, and without any action
on the part of Buyer or Seller, in accordance with the LPA the Supplemental
Unit shall automatically convert into the number of Common Units set forth in
this _Section 1.08(c_), which Common Units shall be delivered by Buyer in
accordance with this _Section 1.08(c)_ upon conversion of the Supplemental
Unit. Within five (5) Business Days after the calculation of the Adjusted
EBITDA becomes final, conclusive and binding upon the parties in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 1.08(b)_ subject to Buyers right to
withhold, set-off and apply amounts in accordance with  _Section 9.04_,
Buyer shall deliver (i) to Seller ninety percent (90%) of the number of Common
Units arrived at by dividing the Supplemental Purchase Price by the VWAP as of
December 31, 2014 (rounded up or down to the nearest whole Common Unit, with
any 5 in the first decimal place being rounded up), and (ii) to the Escrow
Agent the remaining ten percent (10%) of the number of Common Units arrived at
by dividing the Supplemental Purchase Price by the VWAP as of December 31,
2014 (rounded up or down to the nearest whole Common Unit, with any 5 in the
first decimal place being rounded up), which ten percent (10%) amount shall be
deposited into the Additional Indemnity Escrow Account to be held and
disbursed in accordance with the terms governing such Additional Indemnity
Escrow Account under the Escrow Agreement, _provided_ , that, if the
Supplemental Purchase Price is zero, in accordance with the LPA the
Supplemental Unit shall be canceled and extinguished and Seller will not be
entitled to receive any Common Units or other amount in substitution for the
Supplemental Unit. The delivery of the Common Units shall be made by delivery
of certificates representing such Common Units (in the case of Seller) and a
statement of holdings of Common Units in book-entry form (in the case of the
Escrow Agent). At the option of Buyer, all of such Common Units delivered to
Seller or the Escrow Agent may be redeemed for cash in accordance with the
LPA. Buyer may exercise such right of redemption by delivering written notice
of such exercise to Seller within five (5) Business Days of the date that the
calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA becoming final, conclusive and binding
upon the parties in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.08(b)_.
Seller agrees that the Supplemental Unit shall not be transferrable in whole
or in part and the Common Units received in substitution for the
Supplemental Unit shall be subject to the resale restrictions set forth in
_Section 8.02_.

 



9 (d) _Supplemental Option_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement and prior to the delivery of Common Units upon conversion
of the Supplemental Unit in accordance with _Section 1.08(c)_, Buyer shall
have the option (the " _Supplemental Option_ ") to either (i) redeem
the Supplemental Unit for an amount equal to Fifty Million Dollars ($50
million) (the " _Supplemental Redemption Amount_ ") in immediately available
funds or (ii) convert the Supplemental Unit into a number of Common Units
arrived at by dividing the Supplemental Redemption Amount by the VWAP as of
the date of the Supplemental Option Notice (rounded up or down to the nearest
whole Common Unit, with any 5 in the first decimal place being rounded up) (in
either case, the " _Supplemental Payment_ "), in either case, in accordance
with the terms of the LPA. If Buyer elects to exercise such option, it shall
deliver written notice thereof (the " _Supplemental Option Notice_ ") to
Seller and the Supplemental Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon such
delivery. Subject to Buyers right to withhold, set-off and apply amounts in
accordance with _Section 9.04_, within five (5) Business Days of the date of
the Supplemental Option Notice, Buyer shall deliver ninety percent (90%) of
the Supplemental Payment to Seller and the remaining ten percent (10%) of the
Supplemental Payment to the Escrow Agent, which ten percent (10%) amount shall
be deposited into the Additional Indemnity Escrow Account to be held and
disbursed in accordance with the terms governing such Additional Indemnity
Escrow Account under the Escrow Agreement. The delivery of any Common Units
comprising the Supplemental Payment shall be made by delivery of certificates
representing such Common Units (in the case of Seller) and a statement of
holdings of Common Units in book-entry form (in the case of the Escrow Agent).
No fractional Common Units will be delivered to Seller or the Escrow Agent
under this _Section 1.08(d)_. Any such fractional Common Unit shall be
rounded up or down to the nearest whole Common Unit, with any 5 in the first
decimal place being rounded up. Upon the completion of the Supplemental
Payment to Seller, Buyer shall have no further obligation to pay any further
Supplemental Purchase Price.

(e)  _No Duplication of Payments_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
circumstance shall Buyer be required to pay both the Supplemental Purchase
Price and the Supplemental Payment. In the event that a Supplemental Option
Notice is delivered, Buyer will be required to make the Supplemental Payment
and will not be required to pay the Supplemental Purchase Price under any
circumstances.

(f) _Buyer Discretion_. Seller understands and acknowledges that control of
all business decisions regarding the Company Group (including, without
limitation, sales and marketing, capital expenditures, product pricing,
product development, product deployment, employee hiring and retention,
subcontracting authority, facilities management and acquisitions or
dispositions of assets (and the timing thereof)), from and after the
Closing Date shall be the ultimate right of the board of directors of the
General Partner, and that Buyer may operate its business and the business of
its Subsidiaries (including the Company Group) in the manner it deems
appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not take any action
in bad faith with the intent of depriving Seller of the benefit of the
Supplemental Purchase Price provided for herein.

(g) _Securities Law Compliance_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required to issue Common Units to Seller
under _Section 1.08(c)_ or  _1.08(d)_ unless, as reasonably requested by
Buyer, prior to receiving such Common

 



10  Units, Seller executes and delivers to Buyer one or more documents
representing as to certain matters in support of the exemption, acknowledging
the restricted nature of such Common Units and representing that Seller is an
"accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated under the
Securities Act.

(h) _Mergers, Consolidations, etc_.

(i) If (A) Buyer effects any merger or consolidation of Buyer with or into
another entity, (B) Buyer effects any sale of all or substantially all of its
assets in one or a series of related transactions, (C) any tender offer or
exchange offer (whether by Buyer or another person or entity) is completed
pursuant to which holders of Common Units are permitted to tender or exchange
their units for other securities, cash or property, or (D) Buyer effects any
reclassification of the Common Units or any compulsory unit exchange pursuant
to which the Common Unit is effectively converted into or exchanged for other
securities, cash or property (each, a " _Fundamental Transaction_ "), then in
lieu of any Common Units Seller may be entitled to receive under this
_Section 1.08_ following the Fundamental Transaction, Seller shall have the
right to receive (subject to the conditions to the issuance of such Common
Units hereunder) the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as
it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental
Transaction if it had been the holder of such Common Units immediately prior
to the Fundamental Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may not
engage in any Fundamental Transaction unless the counterparty to any such
Fundamental Transaction executes an agreement acknowledging the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the holders of Common Units in any such
Fundamental Transaction are afforded an election or are otherwise permitted
or required to exchange such Common Units for two or more alternate forms of
consideration, then after such Fundamental Transaction Seller shall have the
right to receive the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property for
which a holder of Common Units would have been entitled to receive if it
failed to exercise such rights of election ( _provided_ that, if the amount
and kind of securities, cash or property receivable upon such Fundamental
Transaction is not the same for each Common Unit in respect of which such
rights of election shall not have been exercised (a " _non-electing unit_ "),
then for the purpose of this  _Section 1.08(h)_, the amount and kind of
securities, cash or property receivable by Seller after such Fundamental
Transaction shall be deemed to be the amount and kind so receivable per unit
by a plurality of the holders of non-electing units).

(ii) In the event that, prior to December 31, 2014, Buyer or its Subsidiaries
sells the Operating Subsidiary or all or substantially all of its assets
(which shall, in any event, include the Facility) (whether such sale is
structured as a sale of equity, a sale of assets, a merger or otherwise) to a
third party purchaser that is not an Affiliate of Buyer (which shall not
include Lender or any other lender of Buyer or any of its Affiliates) (a "
_Subsequent Purchaser_ "), Buyer will require the Subsequent Purchaser to
assume, effective upon the closing of such sale, the obligations under this
Agreement with respect to the payment of the Supplemental Purchase Price
(replacing Buyer with the identity of the Subsequent Purchaser and making
other reasonable modifications in light of the sale); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such Subsequent Purchaser shall be required to pay the entire
Supplemental Purchase Price in cash; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer
shall nonetheless remain liable for such obligations (which may be satisfied
with Common Units) in the event they are not performed by the Subsequent
Purchaser.

only if such conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material
adverse effect on Seller as the holder of the Common Units constituting the
Initial Equity Purchase Price issued to it pursuant to this Agreement and if
such allocations are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the
Code.

Section 1.10 _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Seller
such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or
any Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that

Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16(f)_ , all payments, benefits,
contributions (including all employer contributions and employee salary
reduction contributions) and premiums related to each Employee Plan, including
all wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits and other compensation due
to or on behalf of any employees or other service providers, have been timely
paid or made in full or, to the extent not yet due, properly accrued on the
balance sheet included in the Recent Financial Statements in accordance with

status of any such

Company Group under Chapter 43 of the Code. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.16(f)_ , no filing has been made in respect of any Employee Plan under the

applicable Laws.

any Employee Plan, any Employee Plan nor, to Sellers Knowledge, any

nor is any such audit or investigation pending or, to Sellers Knowledge,
threatened.

in excess of $25,000 owed by any current or former employee, consultant or

bona fide third-party insurers. No Employee Plan is maintained through a human

applicable to such SEC Document, and did not contain any untrue statement of a

or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent

Section 8.02 _Resale of Common Units_.

(a) Seller agrees that, other than transfers to Permitted Transferees and
subject to _Section 8.02(g)_, it shall not sell or otherwise transfer any of
the Common Units included as part of the Initial Equity Purchase Price during
the Lock-Up Period. Buyer may impose stop-transfer instructions and may stamp

MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED AT
THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE PARTNERSHIP."

 



55 (b) If Seller should decide to dispose of any of such Common Units issued as
part of the Initial Equity Purchase Price, Seller understands and agrees that

"THE UNITS REPRESENTED BY THIS [CERTIFICATE] [STATEMENT OF HOLDING] HAVE NOT

_SECURITIES ACT_ "), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT AS
SET FORTH IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE. BY ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF, THE HOLDER
AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT OFFER, RESELL, PLEDGE, DISTRIBUTE OR OTHERWISE

REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (B) PURSUANT TO AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT."

(c) Buyer shall provide its transfer agent with written instructions in the

on any day more than 20,000 Common Units; and (ii) Seller and its Permitted
Transferees shall not sell in any calendar month more than 200,000 Common
Units. Further, after the issuance of any Common Units that are part of a
Supplemental Purchase Price Amount and subject to  _Section 8.02(g)_, Seller
agrees with respect to such Common Units, that (i) Seller and its Permitted
Transferees shall not sell on any day more than 20,000 Common Units; and (ii)
Seller and its Permitted Transferees shall not sell in any calendar month
more than 200,000 Common Units.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall take such action as Seller or
any Permitted Transferee may reasonably request, including, without
limitation, removing any stop transfer instructions and/or removing or causing
to be removed any restrictive legend described herein and issuing or causing
to be issued Common Unit certificates (or statements of holding in book-entry
form) without a restrictive legend to Seller or a Permitted Transferee or
their designees (including, in either case, Buyer causing its counsel to issue
to its transfer agent any necessary legal opinions in connection therewith,
subject to receipt of any customary representation letter required from
Seller), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Person to
sell Common Units without registration under the Securities Act in accordance
with Rule 144 under the Securities Act (" _Rule 144_ ") and subject to any
applicable limitations otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. Upon
the request of Seller or any Permitted Transferee in connection with such
Persons sale of Common Units pursuant to Rule 144, Buyer shall deliver to
such person a written statement confirming its compliance with such
requirements.

 



56 (f) With a view to making available to Seller and any Permitted Transferee the
benefits of Rule 144, Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to: (i)
make and keep public information available, as those terms are used in Rule
144, at all times; (ii) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and
other documents required of Buyer under the Exchange Act; and (iii) furnish
to Seller and any Permitted Transferee, so long as Seller or any Permitted
Transferee owns any Common Units, promptly on request, (A) a written statement
by Buyer that it has complied with the reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act, and (B) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of Buyer and
such other reports and documents so filed by Buyer with the SEC if not
otherwise available on the SECs EDGAR system. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyers obligations under this clause (f) with respect to any Common Units
issued hereunder shall terminate one (1) year after such issuance.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions on Seller and its
Permitted Transferees contained in this _Section 8.02_ shall terminate and
become null and void upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation by
Buyer of a transaction or series of transactions with any Person or group

involving Buyer that would result in such Person or group beneficially owning
more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities of Buyer;
(ii) the acquisition by any Person or group other than Rentech, Inc. and its
Affiliates by means of a tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction
of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities of

of a sale, lease or other conveyance of all or a majority of the assets of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(including all limited liability company membership interest transfer taxes,
if any) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Related Agreements
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will be borne by Buyer,
and Buyer will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such sales and transfer taxes, and, if
required by applicable Law, Seller or the Company Group will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation.

Section 8.04 _Other Tax Matters_.

(a) _Tax Periods Ending on or before Closing Date_ __. Seller shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all income Tax Returns
for the Company Group for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
that are filed after the Closing Date. Seller shall permit Buyer to review

to filing. The parties agree that the books of the Company Group shall close
as of the end of the Closing Date. 

(b) _Straddle Tax Periods_. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company relating to
Straddle Periods that are filed after the Closing Date. With respect to Tax
Returns that relate to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall permit Seller to review
and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing and shall make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller, subject
to Buyers approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Pursuant to
its obligations in 

 



57   _Section 8.04(c)_, Seller shall remit, at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the due date (with all extensions) for each such Tax Return, the
amount allocable to Seller unless such amount was taken into account in the
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital.

(c) _Indemnification_. Subject to _Section 9.02(b)(i)_, Seller shall
indemnify the Company and Buyer and hold them harmless from and against (i)
all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company Group for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date; (ii) with respect to all
Straddle Periods, all Taxes imposed on the Company Group that are allocable,
pursuant to _Section 8.04(d)_, to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on
(and including) the Closing Date; (iii) all Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of Seller for all taxable periods and (iv) any and all Taxes of any
Person (other than the Company Group) imposed on the Company Group as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any Law, rule or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be required to
indemnify Buyer for any Taxes that were accrued as part of the Final Net
Working Capital or included with the Company Group Closing Payment. Buyer
shall indemnify Seller and hold it harmless from and against (A) all Taxes (or
the non-payment thereof) of the Company Group for all taxable periods
beginning after the Closing Date; (B) with respect to all Straddle Periods,
all Taxes imposed on the Company Group that are allocable, pursuant to
_Section 8.04(d)_, to the portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date; and (C) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the
Company) imposed on the Company Group as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to any Law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring after the Closing Date. In the event of a
conflict between a provision in this _Section 8.04(c)_ and a provision in
_Section 9.02_, the provision in this _Section 8.04(c)_ shall control.

 

(d) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of
any Taxes for the pre-Closing and post-Closing portions of such Straddle
Period shall be determined as follows: The portion of any Tax that is
allocable to the taxable period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date
will be: (i) in the case of real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and
similar ad valorem Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the
case of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the Company
terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date; and

(e) _Refunds_. Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or the Company that
relate to a Tax that was either paid by the Company or any member of the
Company Group on or before the Closing Date or accrued as part of the Final
Net Working Capital or included with the Company Group Closing Payment shall
be for the account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller the amount of
any such refund within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof.

(f) _Contests_. In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding that relates to periods ending on or before the Closing Date or
for which Buyer may seek indemnity from Seller, Seller shall have the right,
at its expense, to participate in and control the conduct of such audit or
proceeding but only to the extent that such audit or proceeding relates to

 



58  a potential adjustment for which Seller has acknowledged liability to Buyer
under this Agreement. Seller shall keep Buyer fully informed of the progress
of any such audit or proceeding, and Buyer may also participate in any such
audit or proceeding at its expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may
not pay, discharge, settle, compromise or otherwise dispose of any audit or
proceeding with respect to the Company Group without the prior written
consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); _provided_ that no Buyer consent shall be required to settle or
otherwise dispose of the Sales and Use Tax Audits in the event that Buyer and
the Company Group are not financially liable and no wrongdoing on behalf of
Buyer or the Company Group is admitted in connection with such settlement or
disposition. If Seller does not assume the defense of any such audit or
proceeding promptly, Buyer may defend and settle the same (for Sellers
account and at Sellers expense) in such reasonable manner as it may deem
appropriate. In the event that a potential adjustment as to which Seller would
be liable is present in the same proceeding as another potential adjustment
for which Buyer would be liable, Buyer shall have the right, at its expense,
to control such audit or proceeding. With respect to a potential adjustment
for which both Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer or the Company Group, on
the other hand, could be liable, or which involves an issue that recurs or
affects related tax items for any period ending after the Closing Date
(whether or not the subject of audit as such time), (i) both Buyer and Seller
may participate in the audit or proceeding, each at its own expense, and (ii)
the audit or proceeding shall be controlled by Buyer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer may not pay, discharge, settle, compromise or otherwise
dispose of any audit or proceeding with respect to a potential adjustment for
which Seller could be liable without the prior written consent of Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonable withheld or delayed); provided that
no Seller consent shall be required in the event that Seller is not
financially liable and no wrongdoing on behalf of Seller is admitted. In the
event of a conflict between a provision in this _Section 8.04(f)_ and a
provision in _Section 9.07_, the provision in this  _Section 8.04(f)_ shall
control.

(g) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Company Group and Seller shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation, or other
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Buyer, the Company Group and Seller agree (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company Group
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer
or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
the other party so requests, Buyer, the Company Group or Seller, as the case
may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

 



59 Section 8.05 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) All confidential information relating to the Company Group or the Business
of which Seller is aware as a result of its involvement with the Company
Group before Closing shall be treated as the sole property of the Company
Group, and Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to keep confidential all of
such information. The obligation to keep such information confidential
shall not apply to: (i) any information which is or becomes known to the
public through no fault of Seller; (ii) disclosures in accordance with
applicable Law or an Order of a Governmental Entity; (iii) any disclosures to
Representatives of Seller who have a need to know in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that agree to maintain
confidentiality of such information in accordance with this Agreement; or (iv)
in connection with disputes relating hereto which arise between the parties.

(b) The parties agree to maintain, and to cause their Representatives to
maintain, the confidentiality of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Related Agreements and all documents executed and delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Related Agreements except to the extent disclosed in any press release
permitted by _Section 5.05_ or any SEC filings required to be made by Buyer.
The provisions of this _Section 8.05(b)_ shall not apply to particular
conditions or terms of the above referenced documents (i) if the party
seeking to make such disclosure shall have obtained the prior written consent
of the other party to the disclosure of such conditions or terms, (ii) that
are required to be disclosed during the course of any Proceeding which may be
brought by either party related to the provisions of any of the above
referenced documents, (iii) that are or become generally available to the
public other than as a result of actions taken by the party seeking to
make such disclosure or its agents or Representatives in violation of this
Agreement, or (iv) that are required to be disclosed pursuant to and in
accordance with any Law or Order applicable to the party seeking to make such
disclosure.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a party is requested or required (by
oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or document
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of
the above-referenced documents or confidential information, such party will
promptly notify the other party of such request so that such other party may
seek an appropriate protective order, at its sole expense, or waive
compliance with the provisions hereof. If, in the absence of a protective
order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, a party is nonetheless, upon the
advice of its counsel, under an obligation to disclose any terms or
conditions of the above-referenced documents or any confidential information
to any Governmental Entity or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other
censure or penalty, such party may disclose such documents or information to
such Governmental Entity without liability hereunder.

Section 8.06 _Closing Date Bonus Payment; Gutacker and Edwards Payments_.

(a) _Schedule 8.06_ sets forth a true and accurate list, for each
individual eligible to receive any payment under the Bonus Plans, as
applicable, such individuals: name; salary or annual wage rate (including the
date and amount of any 2012 adjustment thereto); 2012 or quarterly EBITDA
target bonus (as a percentage of salary or annual wage rate) and projected
percentage attainment thereof; 2012 or quarterly Safety/Environmental target
bonus (as a

 



60  percentage of salary or annual wage rate) and projected percentage
attainment thereof; and estimated annual 2012 bonus or fourth quarter 2012
bonus, in each case, earned through the Closing Date assuming the Closing
Date is October 31, 2012 (each an " _Estimated Closing Date Bonus_ "). Buyer
agrees that, on or prior to January 31, 2013, it shall pay (or cause to be
paid) to the Company Group, for the benefit of the Company Groups employees
set forth on _Schedule 8.06_ (as such Schedule shall be updated by Seller in
the event the Closing Date occurs after October 31, 2012), an amount equal, in
the aggregate, to the Closing Date Bonus Payment. Each such employee shall be
paid a portion of the Closing Date Bonus Payment equal to his or her Estimated
Closing Date Bonus (net of applicable withholding taxes), _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any
employee ceases to be eligible to receive his/her respective Estimated Closing
Date Bonus as of the payment date (as determined by Buyer), then any such
portion of the Closing Date Bonus Payment that would otherwise have been paid
to such employee shall instead be paid by Buyer to all other employees then-
receiving payments under such quarterly or annual component of the Bonus
Plans, as applicable, on a pro rata basis. Buyer and Seller agree that, except
as set forth in  _Section 9.02(a)(viii)_, Seller shall have no other
liability with respect to any amounts that may be owed under the Bonus Plans
for calendar year 2012.

(b) At Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with sufficient funds to pay each
of the Gutacker Closing Payment, the Gutacker Employment Release Payment and
the Edwards Severance Amount plus, in each case, the employers share of FICA
and Medicare taxes and any comparable state and local taxes payable with
respect thereto. Buyer agrees that it shall pay on behalf of Agrifos
Fertilizer L.L.C. (or cause Agrifos Fertilizer L.L.C. to pay), in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Gutacker Employment Agreement or the
Edwards Agreement, as applicable, each of the Gutacker Closing Payment, the
Gutacker Employment Release Payment and the Edwards Severance Amount, in each
case, net of all applicable wage withholding and the employees share of FICA
and Medicare taxes and any comparable state and local taxes. If any or all of
the Gutacker Closing Payment, the Gutacker Employment Release Payment and/or
the Edwards Severance Amount fails to become payable in accordance with the
Gutacker Employment Agreement or the Edwards Agreement, as applicable, Buyer
shall promptly, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the date on
which such amount or amounts are forfeited by the applicable executive, pay
to Seller an amount equal to such forfeited amount plus the employers share
of FICA and Medicare taxes and any comparable state and local taxes paid by
Seller to Buyer with respect thereto. Buyer and Seller agree that, except as
set forth in Section 9.02(a)(viii) or to the extent refunded to Seller in
accordance with this Section 8.06(b), Seller shall have no other liability
with respect to the Gutacker Closing Payment, the Gutacker Employment Release
Payment or the Edwards Severance Amount.

arising out of, based upon, resulting from or incident to: 

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
Seller under this Agreement or the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section
6.01(h)(ii)_;

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Seller under this
Agreement;

(iii) any Liabilities arising (regardless of when arising) out of, based upon,
resulting from or incident to (A) the ownership or operation of the Spin-Off
Assets on, prior to or after the Closing or (B) the spin-off of the Spin-Off
Assets pursuant to _Section 5.08_;

 



62 (iv) any and all Company Debt to the extent not included in the Final Closing

(vi) subject to _Schedule 9.02_ , (A) any Environmental Claim or obligation
under any Environmental Law concerning (1) any Facility or (2) the Handling
of Substances by the Company Group or in connection with the Business, in the
case of each of clauses (1) or (2), accruing or arising out of, based upon,
resulting from or incident to events or circumstances in existence on or
prior to the Closing; (B) the Gyp Stack Closing Liability; and (C) the removal
of any NORM existing on or in any Existing Gypsum Stacks as of the Closing
Date, except for Losses to the extent arising out of, based upon, resulting
from or incident to any Environmental Claim concerning actions taken by Buyer
or the Company Group after the Closing;

(vii) the Sales and Use Tax Liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any such
amounts that were accrued as part of the Final Net Working Capital or
included within the Company Group Closing Payment; and

(viii) any Third-Party Claim brought by an employee of the Company Group
asserting that the Estimated Closing Date Bonus set forth on _Schedule 8.06_
with respect to such employee is less than the portion of the Plant Bonus
Liability attributable to such employee; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
any portion of (A) the Plant Bonus Liability to the extent it was included as
part the Closing Date Bonus Payment or (B) any claim brought by (1) David
Gutacker asserting that he has been paid less than the amount of the Gutacker
Closing Payment or the Gutacker Employment Release Payment or (2) Thomas
Edwards asserting that he has been paid less than the amount of the
Edwards Severance Amount, in the case of payments described in clause (B) of
this _Section 9.02(a)(viii)_, to the extent payable in accordance with the
Gutacker Employment Agreement or the Edwards Agreement, as applicable, and net
of applicable wage withholding and the employees share of FICA and Medicare
taxes and any comparable state and local taxes.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the rights to
indemnification under this _Article IX_ and  _Section 8.04_ are subject to
the following limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the following
limitations described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below shall not apply to
Losses arising out of fraud or intentional misrepresentation:

(i) Seller shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party from and against any Losses arising (A) out of breaches or inaccuracies
indemnified under _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ (other than as a result of a breach of
or inaccuracy in a Fundamental Representation or any of the representations
and warranties in  _Section 3.16_ (Employee Benefit Plans) or _Section
3.19_ (Taxes)) or (B) from Environmental Claims and obligations under _Section
9.02(a)(vi)_ until the Buyer Indemnified Parties have suffered aggregate
Losses in excess of Two Million Dollars ($2 million) (the " _Deductible_ "),
in which event the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for only the amount of Losses that 

 



63  exceed the Deductible. Seller shall not have any obligation to indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Party from and against any Losses arising out of breaches of
or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.16_ (Employee Benefit Plans) until the Buyer Indemnified Parties have
suffered aggregate Losses in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the "
_ERISA Deductible_ "), in which event the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification for only the amount of Losses that exceed the
ERISA Deductible. Seller shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Party from and against any Losses arising out of breaches of or
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.19_ (Taxes) or any Losses indemnified under _Section 8.04_ (Other Tax
Matters) (in each case, other than with respect to income Taxes or the Sales
and Use Tax Liability) until the Buyer Indemnified Parties have suffered
aggregate Losses in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the " _Tax
Deductible_ "), in which event the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification for only the amount of Losses that exceed the Tax
Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights of Buyer Indemnified
Parties to indemnification with respect to the following shall not be subject
to the Deductible, ERISA Deductible or Tax Deductible: (1) _Section
9.02(a)(i)_ as a result of a breach of or inaccuracy in a Fundamental
Representation or with respect to income Taxes or the Sales and Use Tax
Liability, (2) _Section 9.02(a)(vii)_ with respect to the Sales and Use Tax
Liability, (3) _Section 9.02(a)(viii)_ with respect to the Plant Bonus
Liability, and (4) _Section 8.04_ with respect to income Taxes or the Sales
and Use Tax Liability.

(ii) The maximum amount which the Buyer Indemnified Parties may recover
arising (A) (1) out of breaches or inaccuracies described in _Section
9.02(a)(i)_ (other than as a result of a breach of or inaccuracy in a
Fundamental Representation or any of the representations and warranties in 
_Section 3.16_ (Employee Benefit Plans) or _Section 3.19_ (Taxes)) and (2)
from Environmental Claims and obligations under _Section 9.02(a)(vi)_ shall
be an aggregate of Twenty Nine Million Dollars ($29 million) (the " _Cap_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the
Cap shall be reduced to an amount equal to (I) Nineteen Million Dollars ($19
million), plus (II) the amount of any Losses (up to a maximum of Ten Million
Dollars ($10 million)) subject to indemnification under _Section
9.02(a)(vi)(B)_ or _(C)_ incurred prior to, or arising out of, based upon,
resulting from or incident to a Claim made by ExxonMobil or a Governmental
Authority prior to, the occurrence of the Triggering Event (such amount, the "
_Reduced Cap_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, any Losses subject to the Cap
under this _Section 9.02(b)(ii)_ incurred prior to the occurrence of the
Triggering Event shall be applied to the Reduced Cap under this _Section
9.02(b)(ii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Indemnified Parties right
to indemnification under _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ as a result of a breach of or
inaccuracy in a Fundamental Representation and the representations and
warranties in _Section 3.16_ (Employee Benefit Plans) and _Section 3.19_
(Taxes) shall not be subject to the Cap or the Reduced Cap in this _Section
9.02(b)(ii)_.

(iii) Subject to the other limitations contained herein, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall satisfy any finally determined claim for
indemnification under this _Section 9.02_ (A) first, from the Escrow Accounts
in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement (and to the extent the Escrow Funds in such Escrow Accounts may be
used to satisfy such claim), (B) second, if the Escrow Funds in the Escrow
Accounts that may be used to satisfy such claim have been exhausted, by set
off against the Supplemental Purchase Price Amounts pursuant to _Section
9.04(a)_, and (C) third, if the Escrow

 



64  Funds in such Escrow Accounts and the Supplemental Purchase Price Amounts
are insufficient to satisfy all such indemnification claims, then from Seller
directly. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 9.02(b)(iii)_
shall restrict the Buyer Indemnified Parties right to withhold the amount of
an Unresolved Indemnification Claim against the Supplemental Purchase Price
Amounts under  _Section 9.04(b)_.

Section 9.03 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 

(a) After the Closing, Buyer will save, defend and indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates and each of their respective employees, directors, officers,
representatives, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against, and hold each of them harmless from,
any and all Losses arising out of, based upon, resulting from or incident to:

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
Buyer under this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section
6.02(i)(ii)_;

(ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made by Buyer under this Agreement;

(iii) any Liabilities (including those of the Operating Subsidiary or Agrifos
SPA) arising out of, based upon, resulting from or incident to the ownership,
operation or disposal of the Phosphate Assets after the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Losses subject to indemnification under this _Section
9.03(a)(iii)_ shall exclude any Losses subject to indemnification under
_Section 9.02(a)(i)_ or _(vi)_ (other than the cost of disposal of the
Phosphate Assets, including the cost of disposal of any asbestos, NORM or
other Substances included in or on the Phosphate Assets); and

(iv) any Environmental Claim or obligation under any Environmental Law
concerning (A) any Facility or (B) the Handling of Substances by Buyer or the
Company Group or in connection with the Business to the extent arising out of,
based upon, resulting from or incident to actions taken by Buyer or the
Company Group after the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Losses
subject to indemnification under this _Section 9.03(a)(iv)_ shall exclude any
Losses subject to indemnification under _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ or _(vi_ ),
except as otherwise set forth in _Schedule 9.02_ and except to the extent
that any such Losses are attributable to both this _Section 9.03(a)(iv)_ and
_Sections 9.02(a)(i)_ or _(vi)_ , in which event such Losses shall be
apportioned between the parties based upon the pre-Closing contribution to
the Loss (which shall be borne by Seller) and the post-Closing contribution to
the Loss (which shall be borne by Buyer).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the right to
indemnification under this _Article IX_ is subject to the following
limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the following limitations
described in clauses (i) and (ii) below shall not apply to Losses arising out
of fraud or intentional misrepresentation:

(i) Buyer shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Seller Indemnified
Party from and against any Losses arising out of breaches or inaccuracies
described in _Section 9.03(a)(i)_ (other than as a result of a breach of or
inaccuracy in a Fundamental

 



65  Representation) or for Losses subject to indemnification under _Section
9.03(a)(iv)_ until the Seller Indemnified Parties have suffered aggregate
Losses by reason of such breaches or inaccuracies (including as a result of
breaches of or inaccuracies in Fundamental Representations) in excess of the
Deductible, in which event the Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for only the amount Losses that exceed the Deductible. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Seller Indemnified Parties right to
indemnification under _Section 9.03(a)(i)_ as a result of a breach of or
inaccuracy in a Fundamental Representation shall not be subject to the
Deductible. 

(ii) The maximum amount which the Seller Indemnified Parties may recover
arising out of breaches or inaccuracies described in _Section 9.03(a)(i)_
(other than as a result of a breach of or inaccuracy in a Fundamental
Representation), or for Losses subject to indemnification under _Section
9.03(a)(iii)_ and _Section 9.03(a)(iv)_, shall be the Cap; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the Cap shall be
reduced to the Reduced Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, any Losses subject to
the Cap under this _Section 9.03(b)(ii)_ incurred prior to the occurrence of
the Triggering Event shall be applied to the Reduced Cap under this _Section
9.03(b)(ii)_. For the further avoidance of doubt, the Seller Indemnified
Parties right to indemnification under  _Section 9.03(a)(i)_ as a result of
a breach of or inaccuracy in a Fundamental Representation shall not be subject
to the Cap or the Reduced Cap in this _Section 9.03(b)(ii)_.

 

Section 9.04 _Set-Off_.

(a) Subject to _Section 9.02(b)(iii)_, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to withhold and set off against the Supplemental Purchase Price
Amounts payable to Seller hereunder any amount finally resolved (and not
subject to further appeal) to be due from Seller to satisfy a finally
determined indemnification claim hereunder (after taking into consideration
the applicable limitations contained in _Section 9.02(b)_). If Common Units
are to be issued upon conversion of the Supplemental Unit, such finally
resolved amount shall be applied to reduce the Supplemental Purchase Price
Amounts that are used to determine the number of the Common Units that may be
received by Seller upon conversion of the Supplemental Unit in accordance
with _Section 1.08(c)_ or _Section 1.08(d)_.

(b) To the extent that any indemnification claim hereunder of a Buyer
Indemnified Party against Seller remains outstanding or unresolved (an "
_Unresolved Indemnification Claim_ ") on the date that a Supplemental
Purchase Price Amount is required to be paid hereunder, regardless of whether
any Escrow Funds in the Escrow Accounts are available at such time to satisfy
such Unresolved Indemnification Claim or whether any claim has been made by
the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect thereto, Buyer may withhold from
the Supplemental Purchase Price Amount the amount of such Unresolved
Indemnification Claim that may be owed or may become payable in the future
(after taking into consideration the applicable limitations contained in
_Section 9.02(b)(i)_ and _(ii)_ ) until such Unresolved Indemnification Claim
is ultimately resolved (and not subject to further appeal), although the
amount of such Unresolved Indemnification Claim may be contingent or
unmatured. In the event that the Buyer Indemnified Party has exercised its
right to withhold from the Supplemental Purchase Price Amount the amount of an
Unresolved Indemnification Claim, it may not simultaneously request the
Escrow Agent to withhold Escrow Funds from Seller for the amount of the same
Unresolved Indemnification Claim pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

 



66 (c) Upon ultimate resolution of an Unresolved Indemnification Claim, any
amounts withheld in excess of the amount required to satisfy such
indemnification claim (the " _Released Amount_ ") shall be promptly released
as provided in this _Section 9.04(c)_. Buyer shall deliver ninety percent
(90%) of the Released Amount to Seller and the remaining ten percent (10%) of
the Released Amount to the Escrow Agent, which ten percent (10%) amount shall
be deposited into the Additional Indemnity Escrow Account to be held and
disbursed in accordance with the terms governing such Additional Indemnity
Escrow Account under the Escrow Agreement. In the event that the Released
Amount is comprised of Common Units, no fractional Common Units will be
delivered to Seller or the Escrow Agent under the preceding sentence. Any
such fractional Common Unit shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole
Common Unit, with any 5 in the first decimal place being rounded up. At the
option of Buyer, all of the Common Units delivered to Seller or the Escrow
Agent may be redeemed for cash in accordance with the LPA for an amount based
on the VWAP as of the date of the ultimate resolution of the Unresolved
Indemnification Claim. Buyer may exercise such option by delivering written
notice to Seller and the Escrow Agent of Buyers election to redeem such
Common Units for cash. Seller agrees that such Common Units shall be subject
to the resale restrictions set forth in _Section 8.02_.

 

Section 9.05 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive
remedy for any Claim with respect to the breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement or other express indemnification obligation
set forth in this Agreement shall be those remedies set forth in this
_Article IX_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall preclude any
party hereto from (a) enforcing its rights to an injunction or specific
performance with respect to the performance of post-Closing agreements or
obligations pursuant to _Section 11.11_ or (b) seeking any remedy based upon
fraud or intentional misrepresentation by any other party hereto (including,
without limitation, any fraud or intentional misrepresentation committed by
any officer, director, member, employee or agent of Seller, the Company Group
or any Affiliate thereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement).

 

Section 9.06 _Additional Provisions Regarding Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article IX_ , the right to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ is subject to the following
limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the following limitations described
in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) below shall not apply to Losses arising out of
fraud or intentional misrepresentation:

 

(i) in no event will any party to this Agreement be liable under this
Agreement (for indemnification) to any other party or other Person for
punitive damages in connection with any Losses, except where such damages are
received by a third party from an Indemnified Party in connection with Losses
indemnified hereunder;

 

(ii) the amount of Loss for which any party to this Agreement may be entitled
to seek indemnification under this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of
any third-party insurance (and not self-insurance) proceeds or other payment
from a third party that is actually received by such party (or its Affiliates)
with respect to such Loss (net of any out-of-pocket 

 



67  expenses incurred in obtaining such amounts, any co-payment, retrospective
premium adjustment and increased premiums resulting from such Loss ("
_Reduction Amounts_ "));

 

(iii) if an Indemnified Party, after having received any indemnification
payment pursuant to this Agreement with respect to a Loss, subsequently
actually receives any third-party insurance proceeds or other payment from a
third party for which it was actually indemnified pursuant to this _Article
IX_ , such Indemnified Party will promptly refund and pay to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such insurance proceeds or payment (net
of applicable Reduction Amounts); and

(iv) each party to this Agreement (and the Company Group) will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses with respect to which
it may be entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) this clause (iv) shall not require any
party to take any action to recover Losses from any third party unless doing
so is commercially reasonable; and (b) the taking of any such action shall not
be a condition to indemnification rights hereunder.

(b) All indemnification payments pursuant to this _Article IX_ or _Article
VIII_ shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by Law.

 

Section 9.07 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) Should any Claim or Proceeding by or involving a third party (including
any Governmental Entity) not party to this Agreement (or an Affiliate thereof)
arise after the Closing Date for which a party (" _Indemnifying Party_ ") has
an indemnification obligation under the terms of this Agreement (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), the other party (" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing (a " _Third-Party Claim Notice_ ") within a
reasonable time after such Claim or Proceeding arises and is known to the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party to provide the Indemnifying Party a Third-Party Claim
Notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder
unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced as a result thereof.

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party wishes to assume the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to Indemnified Party
that it intends to assume such defense within fifteen (15) days after notice
from Indemnified Party of such Third-Party Claim, the expenses of which such
defense shall be paid, as incurred, by the Indemnifying Party;  _provided_
that, as a condition precedent to the Indemnifying Partys right to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party must first
acknowledge in writing to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any Losses based upon,
arising out of or resulting from such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall thereafter assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, through
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnified Party; _provided_ that
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense but, in
any event, Indemnifying Party shall have the right, as long as it is actively
defending any Claim or Proceeding, to control such defense. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Indemnified Party reasonably determines based on the
advice of counsel that the representation by counsel chosen by the
Indemnifying Party creates a 

 



68  conflict of interest and notifies the Indemnifying Party thereof, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
claim with counsel of its choice for such purpose and the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred
(provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay the fees
and expenses for more than one such counsel and one local counsel in
each relevant jurisdiction for all Indemnified Parties). The Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with Indemnifying Party, its counsel and its
other authorized Representatives in connection with the exercise of the rights
of Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 9.07_.

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle, compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment with respect to any such Third-Party Claim, with
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party may be withheld in its sole
discretion if such settlement, compromise or consent: (i) involves the payment
of money damages (other than money damages constituting the Deductible) that
will be paid by the Indemnified Party under this Agreement in connection
therewith; (ii) imposes any injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party; (iii) requires the finding or admission of any wrongdoing
by the Indemnified Party or (iv) does not include an express, unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party from any liability or obligation with respect
to such Third-Party Claim. If (A) the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the
defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with  _Section 9.07(b)_, (B)
the Indemnifying Party fails to appropriately prosecute the defense of any
Third-Party Claim that it has previously assumed or fails to pay the
reasonable costs and expenses of the defense of any such Third-Party Claim
(including fees of counsel), as incurred, or (C) the Third-Party Claim seeks
an order, injunction or other equitable relief for other than monetary damages
against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may, by written notice
to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or
settle such Third-Party Claim with counsel of the Indemnified Partys
selection, but the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability with respect to
any compromise, settlement or consent to entry of any judgment with respect
to such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim in
accordance with the preceding provisions, the Indemnifying Party will keep
the Indemnified Party informed of all material developments relating to or in
connection with such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with the preceding
provisions, the parties hereto will reasonably cooperate in the defense
thereof (with the Indemnifying Party being responsible for all reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Party in connection with such
cooperation). If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Section
9.07(d)_ shall apply to the Indemnified Party.

(e) Any claim on account of Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement which does not involve a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by
reasonably prompt written notice (a " _Notice of Claim_ "), stating, in
reasonable detail, and to the extent known, the nature and basis of such claim
and a good faith, non-binding, preliminary estimate of the aggregate dollar
amount of actual Losses that have arisen and are expected to arise as a
result of such breach or other matter as set forth on such Notice of Claim,
given by the

 



69  Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying
Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder
unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced as a result thereof.

(f) Upon receipt of a Notice of Claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall consult with each other in an attempt to agree upon
the matters set forth in the Notice of Claim and reach a written agreement
with respect to such matters (a " _Claim Settlement Agreement_ "). If the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party fail to agree upon the matters
contained in such Notice of Claim within thirty (30) days after the date the
Notice of Claim is delivered to the Indemnified Party, then, at the request of
any party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall meet in an
attempt to resolve the objection described in such Notice of Claim and reach
a Claim Settlement Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party enter into a Claim Settlement Agreement, the objections contained in
such Notice of Claim shall be deemed to be as resolved as provided therein. If
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to resolve the
objection described in such Notice of Claim within sixty (60) days after
delivery by the Indemnified Party of such Notice of Claim, then either party
may submit the objections contained in such Notice of Claim for resolution in
a proceeding commenced as contemplated by _Section 11.07_.

 

Section 9.08 _Calculation of Loss Amount_. For purposes of determining the
amount of any Losses with respect to any claim for indemnification under
_Section 9.02_ or _Section 9.03_ (but not for purposes of determining
whether any representation or warranty in this Agreement has been breached),
any qualifiers as to materiality (including Company Group Material Adverse
Effect, Buyer Material Adverse Effect or similar terms), contained in an
applicable representation and warranty shall be deemed to be deleted and shall
be given no force or effect.

 

Section 9.09 _Easements_. If Buyer or the Operating Subsidiary determines and
gives notice to Seller, during the applicable survival period, that Sellers
representations and warranties set forth in the second or third sentence of
_Section 3.11_ are inaccurate in any respect, then Seller shall cooperate
with Buyer and the Company Group to grant, or cause to be granted, to the
Operating Subsidiary, within thirty (30) days of written notice from the Buyer
or the Operating Subsidiary, at no cost or expense to Buyer or the Operating
Subsidiary, such easements (in recordable form) as are reasonably necessary
to provide the Operating Subsidiary with access to and from and ability to
use, operate, maintain, repair and replace all of the properties and assets of
the Company Group located on the Jones Property as of the date hereof to the
extent that the easements reserved to the Operating Subsidiary in the Special
Warranty Deed attached hereto as _Exhibit Q_ are insufficient to allow the
Operating Subsidiary to use, operate, maintain, repair and replace all of
the properties and assets of the Company Group located on the Jones Property
as of the date hereof.

protections of this provision.

Section 11.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
the State of New York (regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern

including but not limited to matters of validity, construction, effect,

Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought
and enforced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of
New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, and the parties hereby waive any objection to jurisdiction or venue
in any such proceeding commenced in or removed to such courts. EACH PARTY

import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Schedules and
Exhibits, as the same may from time to time be amended, modified,
supplemented or restated, and not to any particular article, section,
subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement. The
Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement and Annex I are incorporated into
and form an integral part of this Agreement. Each Schedule corresponds to a
specific section or subsection of this Agreement. The disclosure in any
section or subsection of the Schedules qualifies other sections
and subsections in this Agreement for which the relevance or applicability of
such disclosure is reasonably apparent. Certain information set forth in the
Schedules to this Agreement is included solely for informational purposes and
may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The
disclosure of any information in the Schedules shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgment that such information is required to be disclosed
in connection with the representations and warranties made by Seller in this
Agreement or that such information is material, nor shall such information be
deemed to establish a standard of materiality, nor shall it be deemed an
admission of any breach of this Agreement or liability to any third party, or
a concession as to any defense available to Seller. References in this
Agreement or the Schedules to dollar amount thresholds will not be deemed to
be evidence of materiality or of a Company Group Material Adverse Effect or
Buyer Material Adverse Effect. The use in this Agreement of the term
"including" means "including without limitation." The title of and the
article, section and paragraph headings in this Agreement and the provision of
tables of contents are for convenience of reference only and shall not govern
or affect the interpretation of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement. The use herein of words importing the singular include the plural
and vice versa, and the use of the masculine, feminine or neuter forms shall
also denote the other forms, as in each case the context may require. The
language used in this Agreement has been chosen by the parties to express
their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied
against any party. Accounting terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings given to them under GAAP. All references to monetary
amounts are to the currency of the United States and any payment contemplated
by this Agreement shall be made (except as otherwise provided) in cash,
certified check, wire transfer or any other method that provides immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the payee. If any
payment is required to be made or other action is required to be taken
pursuant to this Agreement on a date which is not a Business Day, then such
payment or action shall be made or taken on the next Business Day. Unless
expressly provided otherwise, the measure of a period of one month or year
for purposes of this Agreement shall be that date of the following month or
year corresponding to the starting date, provided that if no corresponding
date exists, the measure shall be that date of the following month or
year corresponding to the next day following the starting date. For example,
one month following February 18 is March 18, and one month following March 31
is May 1\. The parties of this Agreement shall act under this Agreement in
good faith. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement and of any part
hereof.

 



75 Section 11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Related Agreements,
including the Schedules, Exhibits, Annexes, documents, certificates and
instruments referred to herein and therein, embody the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings between the parties with respect thereto.

 

Section 11.11 _Specific Performance_.

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the
other party to this Agreement would be irreparably damaged in the event that
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that the other parties to
this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce
specifically the performance by the other party under this Agreement, and each
party to this Agreement hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit
that the other parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law, and
hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in connection with
obtaining such relief.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
including _Section 11.11(a)_ above, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that Seller shall not be entitled to injunctive relief or to enforce
specifically the obligations of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless (i) all of the conditions set forth in 
_Section 6.01_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at Closing, but each of which is
more likely than not to be satisfied by actions taken on the Closing
Date), (ii) Buyer fails to complete the Closing by November 30, 2012, and
(iii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed to Buyer in writing that if the New
Financing were funded then Seller would, assuming all of the conditions set
forth in  _Section 6.02_ are satisfied, take such actions that are within
its control to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, while
Seller may pursue (and plead in the alternative) both a grant of specific
performance as expressly permitted by this _Section 11.11_ and payment of
the Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted by _Section
11.13(b)_), under no circumstances shall Buyer be obligated to both
specifically perform the terms of this Agreement and pay the Termination Fee.

Section 11.12 _Financing Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (a) agrees that it
will not bring or support any person in any action, suit, proceedings, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Financing Parties (which defined term for the
purposes of this provision shall include the Financing Parties and their
respective Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, officers, directors,
employees, agents, advisors and representatives involved in the financing
contemplated by the Credit Agreement but excluding Buyer or any of its
Affiliates) in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Credit Agreement or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other
than the 

 



76  federal and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within
New York City; (b) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Credit
Agreement or the documents evidencing the financings contemplated by the
Credit Agreement, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing Parties in any
way relating to the Credit Agreement or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to
the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application
of laws of another jurisdiction; and (c) hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in
any way to the Credit Agreement or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, (i) Seller, its stockholders, their Representatives and their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents
partners, managers or members shall not have any rights or claims against any
Financing Parties, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any, or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made
in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Credit Agreement or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, or in
tort or otherwise and (ii) no Financing Parties shall have any liability
(whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any of Seller, its
stockholders, their Representatives their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents partners, managers or members for any
obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Credit Agreement or the performance thereof or
the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, after the Closing, the Financing Parties shall be third-party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to, the protections of this
provision. 

Section 11.13 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Seller and Buyer shall each
bear their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Operating Subsidiary may pay from its available
cash any Transaction Expenses. Buyer shall be responsible for fees,
commissions, expenses and reimbursements incurred by or required to be paid
to its professional advisors and investment bankers, including those payable
to Buyers Bankers; and at or after the Closing, Seller (not the Company
Group) shall bear (from the Purchase Price payments) and be responsible for
the fees, commissions, costs, charges, expenses and reimbursements incurred
by or required to be paid to the Company Groups and Sellers professional
advisors and investment bankers, including those payable to Macquarie.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(iii)_ or Seller pursuant to  _Section 10.01(c)(iii)_ due
to the failure of the condition

 



77  set forth in _Section 6.01(l)_ and (i) at the date of such termination all
of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ (other than _Section 6.01(l)_)
have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and (ii) upon the
request of Buyer, Seller has irrevocably confirmed to Buyer in writing that if
the New Financing were funded then Seller would, assuming all of the
conditions set forth in  _Section 6.02_ are satisfied, take such actions
that are within its control to cause the Closing to occur, then concurrently
with such termination, Buyer shall pay Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds a fee equal to Five Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($5.1 million) (the " _Termination Fee_ ").

(c) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
_Section 11.13(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Seller would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to _Section 11.13(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Seller commences a suit that results in a judgment against Buyer for the
Termination Fee, Buyer shall pay to Seller its reasonable documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the
Termination Fee, as the case may be, from the date such payment was required
to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any termination
of this Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable in
accordance with _Section 11.13_, the payment of the Termination Fee shall
constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any
other claim which Seller would otherwise be entitled to assert against Buyer
or its Affiliates with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Seller. Buyer and Seller expressly acknowledge and agree that, in
light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect
to the foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where
the Termination Fee is payable in accordance with _Section 11.13_, the rights
to payment under _Section 11.13_: (i) constitute a reasonable estimate of
the damages that will be suffered by reason of any such proposed or actual
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) shall be in full and complete
satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing.

Section 11.14 _Certain Conflicts and Waivers_. It is acknowledged by each of
the parties hereto that Seller, on behalf of itself and the Company Group, has
retained various professional advisors (" _Seller s Advisors_"), including
but not limited to counsel, accountants, actuaries, engineers and
environmental consultants to act on behalf of the Company Group in connection
with the operations of the Company Group prior to the Closing and/or in
connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement; _provided_
,  _however_ , that Buck Consultants, LLC and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
shall not be considered "Sellers Advisors" with respect to the calculation of
the Final Pension and Retiree Liability as of the Closing Date pursuant to 
_Section 1.06(b)_. Buyer hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute
arises after the Closing between the parties hereto, Sellers Advisors may
represent and provide services to Seller in such dispute even though the
interests of Seller may be directly adverse to Buyer and the Company Group,
and even though Sellers Advisors may have represented the Company Group in a
matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for

 



78  the Company Group. Buyer further agrees that, as to all communications prior
to Closing among Seller and/or the Company Group on the one hand and any of
Sellers counsel on the other hand, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence as the same relate or apply to any such
communications belongs to Seller and the same may be controlled by Seller and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Company Group.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer or the Company Group on the one hand and a third party other than
Seller, on the other hand, Buyer or the Company Group may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such
third party.
