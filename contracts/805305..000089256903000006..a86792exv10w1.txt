                A. Subject to Section 1.2(b)(iii), cash in the amount up to one

Principal Shareholder may elect to receive in cash more than 20% of his or its
Australian Shareholder's Amount; and

                B. The aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock of Parent

<PAGE>

Shareholder may elect to receive in cash more than 20% of his or its Japanese
Shareholder's Amount; and

                B. The aggregate number of shares of Parent Shares equal to (A)
such Japanese Shareholder's Amount less the amount of cash elected by such
holder, divided by (B) the amount of Australian dollars converted from USD22.50
based on the daily average of the conversion rates therefor for the period of
ten (10) business days immediately preceding the Closing Date, with such
conversion rates as provided in the U.S. western edition of the Wall Street
Journal.

            (iii) Limitations on Cash Payment. In no event shall the Australian

than the maximum amount of AUD40,000,000 in cash, the AUD40,000,000 in cash will
be paid to the Australian Shareholders and the Japanese Shareholders in
proportion to the amount of cash each Participating Shareholder has elected to
receive.

    Section 1.3 Adjustments to Initial Purchase Price.

         (a) Australian Initial Purchase Price. The Australian Initial Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the sum of (i) any Funded Debt which remains in the
balance sheet of the Australian Company as of the Closing Date ("Australian
Closing Balance Sheet"), and (ii) the amount by which, if any, the Historical
Average Working Capital of such company exceeds the Working Capital of such
company as of the Closing Date. If the Working Capital of such company as of the
Closing Date exceeds such Historical Average Working Capital, then the
Australian Initial Purchase Price shall be increased by such excess (subject to
any decrease in clause (i) above). The Australian Closing Balance Sheet shall
include a reasonable reserve for, among other things, each of the items set
forth in Schedule 1.3(a).

         (b) Japanese Initial Purchase Price. The Japanese Initial Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the sum of (i) any Funded Debt which remains in the
balance sheet of the Japanese Company as of the Closing Date ("Japanese Closing
Balance Sheet" and together with the Australian Closing Balance Sheet, the
"Closing Balance Sheets"), and (ii) the amount by which, if any, the Historical
Average Working Capital of such company exceeds the Working Capital of such
company as of the Closing Date. If the Working Capital of such company as of the
Closing Date exceeds such Historical Average Working Capital, then the Japanese
Initial Purchase Price shall be increased by such excess (subject to any
decrease in clause (i) above). The Japanese Closing Balance Sheet shall include
a reasonable reserve for, among other things, each of the items set forth in
Schedule 1.3(b).

         (c) Adjustment Procedure. The determination of the Funded Debt and
Working Capital of the Australian Company and the Japanese Company on the
Closing Date shall be made as follows:

            (i) Buyer shall prepare a Closing Balance Sheet for each of the
Australian Company and the Japanese Company as of the Closing Date on the same
basis and

                                       3
<PAGE>
applying the same accounting principles, policies and practices that were used
in preparing the balance sheets of such companies attached hereto as Schedule
1.3, including the adjustments from the most recent balance sheets of such
companies contained in the Financial Statements. Buyer shall then determine the
Working Capital (the "Closing Working Capital") and the Funded Debt (the
"Closing Funded Debt") of each of such companies as of the Closing Date. Buyer
shall deliver the Closing Balance Sheets and its determination of the Closing
Working Capital and Closing Funded Debt of each of such companies to the
Sellers' Representative within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date.

            (ii) If within forty-five (45) days following delivery of the
Closing Balance Sheets and the Closing Working Capital and Closing Funded Debt
calculations the Sellers' Representative has not given Buyer written notice of
its objection as to the Closing Working Capital and Closing Funded Debt
calculations (which notice shall state the basis of Seller's objection), then
the Closing Working Capital and Closing Funded Debt calculated by Buyer shall be
binding and conclusive on the parties and be used in computing the adjustments
to the Australian Initial Purchase Price and the Japanese Initial Purchase
Price.

            (iii) If the Sellers' Representative gives Buyer such notice of
objection within such forty-five (45) day period, and if the Sellers'
Representative and Buyer fail to resolve the issues outstanding with respect to
the Closing Balance Sheets and the calculation of the Closing Working Capital or
Closing Funded Debt within thirty (30) days of Buyer's receipt of the Sellers'
Representative's objection notice, the Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall
submit the issues remaining in dispute for resolution to internationally
recognized independent public accountants proposed by the Sellers'
Representative and subject to the approval of Buyer in its sole and absolute
discretion (the "Independent Accountants"), with the Independent Accountants
applying the principles, policies and practices referred to in Section
1.4(c)(i). If issues are submitted to the Independent Accountants for
resolution, (i) the Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall furnish or cause to
be furnished to the Independent Accountants such work papers and other documents
and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accountants
may request and are available to that party or its agents and shall be afforded
the opportunity to present to the Independent Accountants any material relating
to the disputed issues and to discuss the issues with the Independent
Accountants; (ii) the determination by the Independent Accountants, as set forth
in a notice to be delivered to both the Sellers' Representative and Buyer within
sixty (60) days of the submission to the Independent Accountants of the issues
remaining in dispute, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and
shall be used in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital and the Closing
Funded Debt; and (iii) the Principal Shareholders and Buyer will each bear fifty
percent (50%) of the fees and costs of the Independent Accountants for such
determination.

         (d) Holdback. AUD4,000,000 of the Australian Initial Purchase Price and
AUD2,000,000 of the Japanese Initial Purchase Price otherwise payable at Closing
shall be withheld from the payments to the Australian Shareholders and Japanese
Shareholders, respectively. Such amounts shall be withheld from each of the
Participating Shareholders in proportion to their respective percentages
hereunder. Within thirty (30) days of the final determination of the Funded Debt
and Closing Working Capital of each of the Australian Company and the Japanese
Company, the withheld amounts of the applicable company shall be paid to the
applicable company's shareholders in proportion to their respective percentages
to the

                                       4
<PAGE>
extent the applicable Initial Purchase Price was reduced but not by the entire
applicable withheld amount. If the applicable Initial Purchase Price was so
entirely reduced, the amount of any reduction of the applicable Initial Purchase
Price in excess of the applicable withheld amount shall be set-off against the
Earnout Payments of such shareholders pro rata. If on the other hand the
applicable Initial Purchase Price was increased as a result of such final
determination, then the Buyer shall pay the Australian Shareholders and/or the
Japanese Shareholders, as applicable, pro rata the entire applicable withheld
amount plus the amount of such increase within thirty (30) days of such
determination.

    Section 1.4 Calculation of Earnout Amounts.

         (a) Australian Earnout. Subject to Section 1.4(a)(iv) below, the
Australian Earnout Amount payable in the aggregate for all Earnout Years to the
Australian Shareholders shall be the amount up to AUD18,000,000 and shall be
determined as follows:

            (i) For each Earnout Year, the Australian Individual Earnout Amounts
listed on Schedule 1.4(a) shall be determined separately. If an Australian
Individual Target Level listed on Schedule 1.4(a) is achieved for an Earnout
Year, then the corresponding Australian Individual Earnout Amount shall be
payable to the Australian Shareholders for such Earnout Year.

            (ii) If an Australian Individual Target Level is not achieved in a
particular Earnout Year, the amount of such Australian Individual Target Level
can be carried over to a subsequent Earnout Year (or Earnout Years) and the
combined Australian Individual Earnout Amounts for such years can be earned if
the aggregate of the Australian Individual Target Level for such years is met by
the end of the subsequent Earnout Year. Conversely, if an Australian Individual
Target Level is exceeded in a particular Earnout Year, the amount of such excess
can be carried over to a subsequent Earnout Year (or Earnout Years) to determine
the Australian Individual Earnout Amount for such subsequent Earnout Year.

            (iii) In addition, if at least 95% but less than 100% of a combined
Australian Individual Target Level for all Earnout Years is achieved, then 75%
of the corresponding Australian Individual Earnout Amount will be payable with
respect to each Earnout Year in which the Australian Individual Target Level was
not achieved. If at least 90% but less than 95% of a combined Australian
Individual Target Level for all Earnout Years is achieved, then 50% of the
corresponding Australian Individual Earnout Amount will be payable with respect
to each Earnout Year in which the Australian Individual Target Level was not
achieved.

            (iv) If an Australian Individual Target Level for all three Earnout
Years in the aggregate is exceeded by 10% or more, then the corresponding
Australian Individual Earnout Amount for all three Earnout Years in the
aggregate will be increased by 10%.

         (b) Japanese Earnout. Subject to Section 1.4(b)(iv) below, the Japanese
Earnout Amount payable in the aggregate for all three Earnout Years to the
Japanese Shareholders shall be the amount up to AUD12,000,000 and shall be
determined as follows:

                                       5
<PAGE>
            (i) For each Earnout Year, the Japanese Individual Earnout Amounts
listed on Schedule 1.4(b) shall be determined separately. If an Japanese
Individual Target Level listed on Schedule 1.4(b) is achieved for an Earnout
Year, then the corresponding Japanese Individual Earnout Amount shall be payable
to the Japanese Shareholders for such Earnout Year.

            (ii) If a Japanese Individual Target Level is not achieved in a
particular Earnout Year, the amount of such Japanese Individual Target Level can
be carried over to a subsequent Earnout Year (or Earnout Years) and the combined
Japanese Individual Earnout Amounts for such years can be earned if the
aggregate of the Japanese Individual Target Level for such years is met by the
end of the subsequent Earnout Year. Conversely, if a Japanese Individual Target
Level is exceeded in a particular Earnout Year, the amount of such excess can be
carried over to a subsequent Earnout Year (or Earnout Years) to determine the
Japanese Individual Earnout Amount for such subsequent Earnout Year.

            (iii) In addition, if at least 95% but less than 100% of a combined
Japanese Individual Target Level for all Earnout Years is achieved, then 75% of
the corresponding Japanese Individual Earnout Amount will be payable with
respect to each Earnout Year in which the Japanese Individual Target Level was
not achieved. If at least 90% but less than 95% of a combined Japanese
Individual Target Level for all three Earnout Years is achieved, then 50% of the
corresponding Japanese Individual Earnout Amount will be payable with respect to
each Earnout Year in which the Japanese Individual Target Level was not
achieved.

            (iv) If a Japanese Individual Target Level for all three Earnout
Years in the aggregate is exceeded by 10% or more, then the corresponding
Japanese Individual Earnout Amount for all three Earnout Years in the aggregate
will be increased by 10%.

         Section 1.5 Calculation of Target Amounts. Within seventy-five (75)
days of the end of each Earnout Year, the Buyer will calculate each of the
Australian Individual Earnout Amounts and the Japanese Individual Earnout
Amounts for such year, and the Buyer will notify each Principal Shareholder of
the amount of each such Individual Earnout Amount. If within thirty (30) days
following delivery of the amount of each Individual Earnout Amount the Principal
Shareholders have not given Buyer written notice of its objection as to such
Individual Earnout Amounts, then such Individual Earnout Amounts calculated by
Buyer shall be binding and conclusive on the parties. If the Principal
Shareholders give Buyer such notice of objection within such thirty (30) day
period, the Principal Shareholders, either jointly or severally, may request
that the amounts and the calculation be verified by an internationally
recognized accountant ("Determining Accountant"), proposed by them and subject
to the approval of Buyer in its sole and absolute discretion. The decision of
such accountant of the correct amount of each such Individual Target Amount for
such year will be binding on Buyer and all Participating Shareholders. The
Principal Shareholders, jointly and severally, shall pay all costs and expenses
with respect to such accountant.

         Section 1.6 Payment of Earnout Amount.

         (a) Australian Shareholders. Within the later of (i) ninety (90) days
from the end of each Earnout Year, or (ii) if applicable, fifteen (15) days of
the decision by the

                                       6
<PAGE>
Determining Accountant pursuant to Section 1.5 with respect to such Earnout
Year, the Buyer shall pay to each of the Australian Shareholders in cash the
amount equal to the product equal to (x) the aggregate Australian Earnout Amount
for such Earnout Year times (y) such Australian Shareholder's Percentage.

         (b) Japanese Shareholders. Within the later of (i) ninety (90) days
from the end of each Earnout Year, or (ii) if applicable, fifteen (15) days of
the decision by the Determining Accountant pursuant to Section 1.5 with respect
to such Earnout Year, the Buyer shall pay to each of the Japanese Shareholders
in cash the amount equal to the product equal to (x) the aggregate Japanese
Earnout Amount for such Earnout Year times (y) such Japanese Shareholder's
Percentage.

         Section 1.7 Closing. The purchase and sale (the "Closing") provided for
in this Agreement will take place at the offices of Buyer's counsel at 19900
MacArthur Boulevard, Suite 1050, Irvine, California 92612 at 4:00 p.m. (local

        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTICIPATING SHAREHOLDERS

      Section 3.1 Participating Shareholders. Each Participating Shareholder
represents and warrants to Parent and Buyer as follows:

            (a) Title to Shares. Such Participating Shareholder is the owner of
the number of Shares indicated on Exhibit A attached hereto across from such
Participating Shareholder's name. No other person or entity has any right,
title, or interest, beneficially or as registered holder, in or to the Shares
owned by such Participating Shareholder, other than beneficiaries of a trust of
which a Participating Shareholder is a trustee, and such Shares are free and
clear of any claims, liens, encumbrances, security agreements, equities,
options, charges, or restrictions, and can be delivered and surrendered to Buyer
pursuant hereto without obtaining the consent or approval of any other person or
governmental authority. Upon the transfer and delivery of such Shares to Buyer
in accordance with this Agreement and payment therefor, Buyer will become the
owner and holder of all of such Shares free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances, pledges, claims, charges and restrictions on transfer.

            (b) Authority. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid, and
binding obligation of such Participating Shareholder enforceable in accordance
with its terms. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and fulfillment of the terms hereof will not breach any of the terms
and provisions of, or constitute a default by such Participating Shareholder
under, any agreement or instrument to which such Participating Shareholder is a
party or by which such Participating Shareholder is bound, or any statute,
ruling, decree, judgment, order or regulation of any governmental authority
having jurisdiction over such Participating Shareholder or such Participating
Shareholder's property; and no consent, approval, authorization or order of any
court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation by such
Participating Shareholder of the transactions on such Participating
Shareholder's part contemplated hereby.

            (c) Sophistication. Such Participating Shareholder (or the
individual making the investment decision for such Participating Shareholder)
has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that such
Participating Shareholder (or such individual) is capable of evaluating the
risks and merits of a purchase of the Parent Shares and to protect such
Participating Shareholder's own interests in connection with an investment in
the Parent Shares.

            (d) Restricted Securities. Such Participating Shareholder
understands that the Parent Shares issued under this Agreement (i) will be
issued by Parent without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), and without qualification and/or registration
under any other applicable securities laws pursuant to exemptions from
registration and/or qualification contained in the Securities Act and other
applicable securities laws, and (ii) shall constitute "restricted securities" as
defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Such


                                       25
<PAGE>
Participating Shareholder understands that the foregoing exemptions depend upon,
among other things, the bona fide nature of such Participating Shareholder's
investment intent as expressed herein. None of the Parent Shares nor any
interest therein will be sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by such
Participating Shareholder without registration and/or qualification under the
Securities Act and other applicable securities laws unless the sale or other
disposition is made in compliance with exemptions from such registration and
qualification requirements with respect to such resale or disposition and, upon
the request of Parent, such Participating Shareholder, prior to consummation of
any such resale or disposition, provides Parent an opinion of counsel
satisfactory to Parent to the effect that the contemplated transfer may be made
without violating the Securities Act or other applicable securities laws.

            (e) Investment Intent. Such Participating Shareholder is acquiring
the Parent Shares for investment purposes only, for such Participating
Shareholder's own account and not with a view to or for sale in connection with
any distribution of the Parent Shares to others within the meaning of the
Securities Act.

            (f) Residence. Such Participating Shareholder's principal residence
is shown below such Participating Shareholder's signature on the signature page
to this Agreement.

            (g) Legends. Such Participating Shareholder acknowledges that the
certificates representing any of the Parent Shares to be issued to such
Participating Shareholder will contain legends which prohibit an offer to
transfer or a transfer of all or any portion of the Parent Shares unless the
Parent Shares are registered under the Securities Act or unless an exemption
from registration is available with respect to such resale or disposition.

      Section 3.2 Representations of UMTT and UMTT Unit Holders. UMTT and the
UMTT Unit Holders represent and warrant to Buyer that the persons listed in
Schedule 5.10 are the only unit holders in UMTT and at Closing the persons

Breach has not been waived;

            (b) (i) by Buyer if any of the conditions in Article VIII has not

terminate, except that the obligations in Sections 11.2, 11.3 and 11.11 will
survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by a party
because of the Breach of the Agreement by the other party or because one or more
of the conditions to the terminating party's obligations under this Agreement is
not satisfied as a result of the other party's failure to comply


                                       36

with its obligations under this Agreement, the terminating party's right to
pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.
