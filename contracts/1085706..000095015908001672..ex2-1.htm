share of Parent Common Stock, calculated as of the Determination Date, whose
numerator is $10.00 and whose denominator is the Average Closing Price,
provided, however, that in no event shall the Exchange Ratio be greater than
0.38 or less than 0.34 (the "Merger Consideration").

 

 

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and

1.5. Option Plans; Stock Options; Other Convertible Securities.

 

 

(a) Each stock option to purchase Company Common Stock (a "Company Option")
and the Company's Amendment and Restatement No. 3 to the Stock Option Plan
and Restricted Stock Plan of Republic First Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company
Option Plan"), shall be assumed by Parent in a transaction described in
Section 409A or Section 424(a), as applicable, of the Code, subject, in the
event the Option Plan Amendment is submitted to a vote of the Company's
shareholders, to the approval of the Option Plan Amendment by the
Company's shareholders. Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under
this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that (i) each Company Option (other than the Specified Awards)
will be fully vested and immediately exercisable (regardless of the vested
status of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time) for
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such assumed Company Option will
be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent. If deemed necessary or appropriate by the Company and
Parent, the Company shall submit the Option Plan Amendment to a vote of the
Company's shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting and shall use its
best efforts to obtain approval of the Option Plan Amendment by the Company's
shareholders. If the Option Plan Amendment is submitted to a vote of the
Company's shareholders and the Company's shareholders do not approve the
Option Plan Amendment, the holder of each Company Option shall have only
those rights with respect to such Company Option as are provided under the
applicable award, the Company Option Plan and applicable law. If it is not
deemed necessary or appropriate to submit the Option Plan Amendment to a vote
of the Company\'s shareholders, or if the Option Plan Amendment is submitted
to a vote of the Company\'s shareholders and is approved by the Company\'s
shareholders, then, in either case, promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deliver to the
holders of Company Options, notices describing the conversion of such Company
Options into Parent Options. The agreements evidencing the Company Options
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (modified as
described in this Section 1.5(a)) and Parent shall comply with such terms.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for issuance the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to satisfy Parent's obligations under
this Section 1.5(a). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall file a registration statement or statements on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

(b) At and after the Effective Time, the outstanding convertible Company
Trust Preferred Securities and the Company's outstanding Fixed Rate Junior
Subordinated Convertible Debt Securities due 2038 (collectively, the "Company
Convertible Securities") shall be convertible (in accordance with the
provisions of the Trust IV Documents) into that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Company Common Stock into which such Company Convertible Securities could
have been converted immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, subject to adjustment for events subsequent to the
Effective Time. Parent shall make or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to deliver to the holders of Company Convertible Securities notices
describing the effects of the Merger on such Company Convertible Securities.
The Trust IV Documents shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (modified as described in this Section 1.5(b) and supplemented by
any supplemental indenture with the trustee of the applicable Company Trust)
and Parent shall comply or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply
with such terms. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for
issuance the number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to satisfy
Parent's obligations under this Section 1.5(b).

 

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of Parent equity
securities (including derivative securities with respect to any Parent equity
securities) and dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities with respect to any Company equity securities)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is anticipated to be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), with respect to Parent or who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

 

1.6. Parent Common Stock. Except for shares of Parent Common Stock owned by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than DPC Shares), which shall
be converted into treasury stock of Parent as contemplated by Section 1.4
hereof, the shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Merger and such shares
shall remain issued and outstanding.

 

 

1.7. Articles of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of Parent, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, as amended by the Authorized Share Amendment, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

1.8. Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Parent, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

 

 

1.9. Directors and Officers.

 

 

(a) At and after the Effective Time, the directors of Parent shall consist of
the Parent Directors and Company Directors who shall continue as or become
directors of Parent in accordance with Section 7.13 hereof, each to hold
office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.

 

 

(b) The officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

 

1.10. Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this
Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization for the purposes of
Section 368 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 

 

ARTICLE II

 

 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 

 

2.1. Parent to Make Shares and Cash Available. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company (which may be a Subsidiary of Parent) (the "Exchange Agent")
selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company, for the
benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this
Article II (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) the cash in lieu of
fractional shares to be paid in accordance with Section 2.2(f) hereof. Such
cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred
to as the "Exchange Fund."

 

 

2.2. Exchange of Shares.

 

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event more
than three business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The
Exchange Agent shall request street name or nominee record holders to forward
the letter of transmittal and instructions to the appropriate beneficial
owner(s) of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Certificates. The Company shall have the right to review both
the letter of transmittal and the instructions prior to the Effective Time
and provide reasonable comments thereon.

 

 

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly executed letter
of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder of Company
Common Stock became entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of Article
I hereof and/or (ii) the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any,
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered pursuant to Section 2.2(f). The Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. At Parent's option,
the shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder of Company Common Stock
became entitled to receive shall be uncertificated and registered on the
stock books of Parent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the issuance of a certificate; however, a certificate shall be issued
upon such holder's request. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
in lieu of fractional shares or the unpaid dividends and distributions, if
any, payable to holders of Certificates.

 

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock and payable to the holders of record
thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with
this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in exchange for such Certificate.

 

 

(d) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall (i) pay
to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Parent Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered (ii) establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that any
applicable tax has been paid or that no tax is payable with respect thereto.

 

 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares as
provided in this Article II.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who otherwise
would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock an
amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the Average Closing Price
by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock which such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof.

 

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of
fractional shares and/or the unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each
case, without any interest thereon.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Exchange
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

or as an exception to one or more of such party's representations or
warranties contained in Article IV, in the case of the Company, or Article V,
in the case of Parent, or to one or more of such party's covenants contained
in Articles VI or VII.

 

 

The Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure Schedule are qualified
in their entirety by reference to specific provisions of this Agreement and
are not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as
constituting, representations and warranties of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, except as and to the extent provided in this Agreement. If and to
the extent any information required to be furnished in any Schedule is

ARTICLE IV

 

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 

Subject to Article III and the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 

 

4.1. Corporate Organization.

 

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Company
has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
duly licensed or qualified to do business in each

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below) on the Company. The Company is duly registered as a bank holding
company under the BHC Act. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Company, copies of which have previously been made available to Parent,
are true and correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material
Adverse Effect" means, with respect to Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
other than any such effect attributable to or resulting from (1) any change
following the date of this Agreement in banking or similar laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof by courts or
governmental authorities, (2) any change or the effectiveness of any change
following the date of this Agreement in GAAP or regulatory accounting
principles applicable to banks, thrifts or their holding companies generally,
(3) changes following the date of this Agreement attributable to or resulting
from changes in general economic conditions, including changes in the
prevailing level of interest rates, (4) any action or omission of the Company
or Parent, or any of the respective Subsidiaries of either of them, taken in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or with the prior written consent
of the other party hereto, (5) any expenses incurred by such party in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (6)
the engagement by the United States in hostilities, whether or not pursuant
to the declaration of a national emergency or war, or the occurrence, after
the date hereof, of any military or terrorist attack upon or within the
United States, or any of its territories, possessions or diplomatic or
consular offices or upon any military installation, equipment or personnel of
the United States, except to the extent that such engagement or occurrence
has a disproportionate adverse effect on such party, or (7) the announcement
of this Agreement and of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(ii) the ability of such party and its Subsidiaries to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(b) The Company Bank is a commercial bank duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The
deposit accounts of the Company Bank are insured by the FDIC through the
Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, and all
premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have
been paid. The Company's other Subsidiaries are duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective
jurisdictions of incorporation or organization. Each of the Company's
Subsidiaries has the corporate (or equivalent) power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or the location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on such
Subsidiary. The articles of incorporation, bylaws and similar governing
documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, copies of which have previously
been made available to Parent, are true and correct copies of such documents
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the
word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any corporation,
limited liability company, partnership or other organization, whether
incorporated or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for financial reporting
purposes and also includes any statutory trust, if such trust is not
consolidated for financial reporting.

 

 

(c) The minute books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries contain true
and correct records of all meetings and other corporate (or equivalent)
actions held or taken since January 1, 2005 through September 30, 2008 of
their respective shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be, and
Boards of Directors or similar governing authority (including committees
thereof).

 

 

4.2. Capitalization.

Company consists of 20,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, $0.01 par

Stock issued and outstanding, no shares of preferred stock of the Company

Stock reserved pursuant to the Company Option Plan and 1,661,538 shares of
Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the conversion of the
outstanding convertible Company Trust Preferred Securities. All of the issued
and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Except
as referred to above or reflected in Section 4.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not have and is not bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any
shares of Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company or
any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any
shares of Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company.
As of the date of this Agreement, the names of the optionees or grantees of
restricted stock, the grant date of each option to purchase Company Common
Stock or restricted stock grant, the number of shares subject to each such
option or grant, the restriction period of each restricted stock grant and
the price at which each such option may be exercised under the Company Option
Plans are set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Each Company Option was granted with an exercise price of not less than fair
market value of a share of Company Common Stock as of the date such Company
Option was granted and there has been no backdating of any Company Option.

 

 

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company. Except for the
Company Trust Preferred Securities and as set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of
the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock or other equity
interests of each of such Subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever, and all of such shares or
equity interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of the Company, other than
the Company Trusts, is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity
interest of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
interest of such Subsidiary.

this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly approved by
the Board of Directors of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company
has directed that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be
submitted to the Company's shareholders for approval and adoption at
a meeting of such shareholders and, except for the approval and adoption of
this Agreement by the requisite vote of the Company's shareholders, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
approve and adopt this Agreement and to consummate the Merger. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent) this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may
be limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law
or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and similar
laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally.

Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions
hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or

response to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) by any such person, if and
only to the extent that (x) the Company's Board of Directors concludes in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders
under applicable law, (y) prior to providing any information or data to any
person in connection with a Superior Proposal by any such person, the
Company's Board of Directors receives from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which executed confidentiality agreement shall have been provided to the
Parent for informational purposes), and (z) at least 48 hours prior to
providing any information or data to any person or entering into discussions
or negotiations with any person, the Company notifies Parent in writing
promptly of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with, any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such person and the material terms
and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers, and (iii) to withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its
shareholders referred to in Section 7.5 hereof in order to accept a Superior
Proposal. The Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
information related thereto, which notification shall describe the
Acquisition Proposal and identify the third party making the same.

 

 

(c) The Company agrees that it will, and will cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions, or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(d) For purposes of this Section 7.4:

 

 

(i) The term "Acquisition Proposal" means any tender offer or exchange offer
or any proposal for a merger, acquisition of all of the stock or assets of,
or other business combination involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the acquisition of fifty percent (50%) or more of the total
voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company or the
acquisition or purchase of assets that constitute fifty percent (50%) or more
of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

 

 

(ii) The term "Superior Proposal" means, with respect to the Company, any
bona-fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made by a person other
than Parent which is on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company in
good faith concludes (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel), taking into account, among other things, all break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation and all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person
making the proposal, (A) is more favorable to its shareholders (in their
capacities as shareholders) than the Merger and for which financing, to the
extent required, is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be
available by the Board of Directors of the Company, and (B) is reasonably
capable of being completed.

 

 

(e) If a Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Company shall pay
to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), within two (2)
business days following such Payment Event, a fee of Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000) (the "Break-up Fee").

 

 

"Payment Event" means (x) the termination of this Agreement by Parent
pursuant to Section 9.1(f) as a result of a breach by the Company of any of
its covenants under any of Sections 7.4(a), 7.4(c), 7.5 or 7.6, or pursuant
to Section 9.1(h), or by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(i), and (y) the
occurrence of any of the following events within twelve (12) months

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of any such termination of this Agreement, provided that an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made after the date hereof and prior to such
termination (which shall not have been withdrawn in good faith prior to such
termination): (i) the Company merges with or into, or is acquired, directly
or indirectly, by merger or otherwise by, a Third Party; (ii) a Third Party,
directly or indirectly acquires more than 50% of the total assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (iii) a Third Party,
directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the outstanding Company
Common Stock. As used herein, "Third Party" means any person as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (other than Parent or its affiliates).

 

 

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.4(e)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and
that without these agreements Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, in the event the Company fails to pay to Parent the Break-up
Fee, promptly when due, the Company shall, in addition thereto, pay to Parent
all costs and expenses (including attorney's fees and disbursements) incurred
in collecting such Break-up Fee together with interest on the amount of the
Break-up Fee (or any unpaid portion thereof), from the date such payment was
due until the date such payment is received by Parent, accrued at the
fluctuating prime rate (as quoted in The Wall Street Journal) as in effect
from time to time during the period.

 

 

7.5. Shareholder Meetings. The Company and Parent each shall take all steps
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
respective shareholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date on which the S-4 becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger and, in the case of the Company, if deemed necessary or appropriate by
the Company and Parent, the approval of the Option Plan Amendment, and, in
the case of Parent, to adopt the Authorized Share Amendment (the "Shareholder
Meetings"). Subject, in the case of the Company, to the right of the Company
and its Board of Directors to take action permitted by Section 7.4(b) with
respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company and Parent each will, through its
respective Board of Directors, recommend to its respective shareholders
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and such other matters
as may be submitted by the respective Board of Directors to its respective
shareholders in connection with this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall
coordinate and cooperate with respect to the foregoing matters, with a view
towards, among other things, holding the respective meetings of each party's
shareholders on the same day.

 

 

7.6. Legal Conditions to Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions which it deems necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed
on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) to obtain
(and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any
other third party which is required to be obtained by the Company or Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the
terms and conditions of such consent, authorization, order or approval.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.7. Stock Reserve. Parent agrees from the date of this Agreement to set
aside shares of Parent Common Stock for its obligations under this Agreement
and following approval of the Authorized Share Amendment, until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full, Parent shall reserve a sufficient number
of shares of Parent Common Stock to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

 

7.8. Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market, subject to official notice
of issuance, as of the Effective Time.

 

 

7.9. Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements.

 

 

(a) The employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company
Employees") shall be eligible to participate in those Parent Plans in which
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate, to
the same extent that similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries participate. From and after the Effective Time, Parent may elect
not to provide to the Company Employees any benefits which are not then
provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to their employees notwithstanding
that such benefits were provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to their
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the case of
benefits which are provided at the Effective Time by Parent to employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries but are not then provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to their employees, Parent will as soon as possible after the
Effective Time include the Company Employees in the Parent Plans under which
such benefits are made available.

 

 

(b) With respect to each Parent Plan for which length of service is taken
into account for any purpose, service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides
past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits,
including for vacation entitlement; provided, however, that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any preexisting condition limitations. Each Parent Plan shall
waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under
the applicable Company Plan, and Company Employees shall be given credit for
amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for
purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Parent Plan.

 

 

(c) Parent and the Company agree that, prior to the Effective Time, subject
to the reasonable approval of Parent, the Company may adopt a severance plan
(the "Severance Plan") for those employees not otherwise entitled to a
severance benefit and who will not be retained by Parent following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder and a change in
control retention plan (the "Retention Plan"). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, any Plan or otherwise, Parent agrees from and
after the Closing Date to maintain in full force and effect, without
amendment or modification (i) for a period of no less than one year following
the Closing Date, the Severance Plan and (ii) the Retention Plan until such
time as all Parent or Company obligations are fulfilled thereunder. All
payments of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

severance amount, whether pursuant to the Severance Plan or otherwise, will
be subject to the subject employee's execution of a release that is
satisfactory in form and substance to Parent. Subject to the following
minimum benefits, the Company will grant an eligible full-time employee, who
was exempt from the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") as
of the date of this Agreement, two weeks of severance pay (at his or her then
current pay rate) for each year of service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the employment termination date. The minimum benefit
for exempt employees shall be two weeks' salary, and the maximum severance
benefit will be ten weeks' salary for Company exempt employees. The Company
will grant an eligible full-time employee, who was not exempt from the
requirements of the FLSA as of the date of this Agreement, one week of
severance pay (at his then current pay rate) for each year of service with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the employment termination
date. The minimum benefit for non-exempt employees shall be one week's
salary, and the maximum severance benefit will be five weeks' salary for
Company non-exempt employees.

 

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time and no later than December 31, 2008, the
Company shall amend all Plans that are subject to Section 409A of the Code to
comply with the final regulations under Section 409A, subject to the prior
review and approval of Parent; provided, however, that in any case where the
consent of a service provider is required for such amendment, the Company
will have fulfilled its obligations under this Section 7.9(d) if it
has exercised reasonable efforts to secure the consent of the service
provider (whether or not such consent is actually given).

 

 

7.10. Indemnification.

 

 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified
Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part
on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that
he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company, any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company or any of their respective predecessors or
affiliates or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to
defend against and respond thereto. It is expressly understood and agreed
that indemnification provided herein does not extend to any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based on any action
or inaction of any Indemnified Party in such party's capacity as director,
officer or employee of any former subsidiary of the Company on and after
January 31, 2005. It is further understood and agreed that after the
Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation incurred by each Indemnified Party
to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking
required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted
or arising

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with Parent;
provided, however, that (1) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and upon such assumption Parent shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense
or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory
to them after consultation with Parent, and Parent shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties; (2) Parent
shall in all cases be obligated pursuant to this Section 7.10(a) to pay for
only one firm or counsel for all Indemnified Parties; (3) Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld); (4) Parent shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law; and
(5) Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party in
respect of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, cost, expense,
judgment or amount paid in settlements which arose out of or resulted from
the gross negligence, criminal activity, willful misconduct or recklessness
of the Indemnified Party. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim Indemnification under this Section 7.10, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify
Parent thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of Parent under this Section 7.10 except to the extent such
failure to notify materially prejudices Parent. Parent's obligations under
this Section 7.10 shall continue in full force and effect without time limit
from and after the Effective Time.

 

 

(b) Parent shall cause the persons serving as officers and directors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by the Company (provided
that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous
than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such.

 

 

(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.

 

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.10 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives.

 

 

7.11. Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.

 

 

7.12. Intentionally Omitted.

 

 

7.13. Appointment of Directors

 

 

. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the number of
directors constituting its Board of Directors to be fixed at twelve (12)
members, and shall take all actions necessary to cause eight (8) of such
members to be Parent Directors (as defined below) and four (4) of such
members to be Company Directors (as defined below), each to hold office until
his/her successor is elected and qualified or otherwise in accordance with
applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent. If any of
the Company Directors does not become, or does not continue in the office of,
a director of Parent because of death, disability or otherwise, Parent
agrees, after consultation with the remaining Company Directors, to cause a
member of the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof who is
mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company to be elected or appointed to
the Board of Directors of Parent as the new Company Director.

 

 

The term "Parent Directors" shall mean individuals who shall be mutually
selected by the Company and Parent from the members of Parent's Board of
Directors immediately prior to the Effective Time to continue as members of
the Board of Directors of Parent after the Effective Time pursuant to this
Section 7.13. The term "Company Directors" shall mean individuals who shall
be mutually selected by the Company and Parent from the members of the
Company's Board of Directors to become members of the Board of Directors of
Parent as of the Effective Time pursuant to this Section 7.13. Nothing in
this Section 7.13 shall require the election or appointment of any individual
whose election or appointment is prohibited or advised against by any
Regulatory Agency. Provided that a Company Director continues to satisfy
the nomination criteria of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
of the Parent Board of Directors at the time such Company Director's initial
term is set to expire, the Parent Board of Directors shall re-nominate and
recommend the election of such Company Director for election by the Parent
shareholders to at least one additional term following the expiration of such
Company Director's initial term of office.

ARTICLE IX

 

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

 

9.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the Merger by the
shareholders of both the Company and Parent:

 

 

(a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

 

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company upon written notice to the other party
(i) 30 days after the date on which any request or application for a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the
request or recommendation of the Governmental Entity having the authority to
grant such Requisite Regulatory Approval, unless within the 30-day period
following such denial or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended
application has been filed with the applicable Governmental Entity (provided,
however, that no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or
recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein) or (ii) if any Governmental Entity
of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger;

 

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before April 30, 2009 ("Closing Deadline"), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; provided, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

however, that either Parent or the Company may extend the Closing Deadline to
July 31, 2009 by notice to the other party on or before April 30, 2009, in
the event that either of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1(d) and
8.1(e) have not been met by March 15, 2009, and the failure of such
condition(s) to have been met is not due to the failure of the party seeking
to extend the Closing Deadline;

 

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company if the respective shareholders of the
Company or the Parent shall have voted at the respective shareholders meeting
on this Agreement and such vote shall not have been sufficient to approve
this Agreement by such respective shareholders, provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) shall not
be available to a party whose shareholders failed to approve this Agreement
if such party did not comply with its obligations under Section 7.5;

 

 

(e) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach
of any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on
the part of the other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days
following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided,
however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) unless the breach of representation or
warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party
receiving such representation or warranty not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby under Section 8.2(a) (in the case of a breach of
representation or warranty by the Company) or Section 8.3(a) (in the case of
a breach of representation or warranty by Parent);

 

 

(f) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach
of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part
of the other party, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty days
following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach
from the other party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured
prior to the Closing; or

 

 

(g) by the Company, in its sole discretion, if (either before or after the
approval of this Agreement by the Company shareholders) during the three
business day period commencing with (and including) the Determination Date
both conditions (1) and (2) below are satisfied. For purposes of this Section
9.1(g), the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

 

 

"Adjusted Parent Ratio" means the number obtained by multiplying (x) the
Parent Ratio, by (y) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the
Exchange Ratio, after giving effect to any adjustment made pursuant to this
Section 9.1(g), by (B) the Exchange Ratio, before giving effect to any
adjustment made pursuant to this Section 9.1(g).

 

 

"Index Price" on a given date means the closing price of the NASDAQ
Bank Index.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Per Share Consideration" means the product of the Exchange Ratio times the
Average Closing Price.

 

 

"Starting Date" means the NASDAQ Stock Market trading day preceding the day
on which the parties publicly announce the signing of this Agreement.

 

 

"Starting Price" means $28.86.

 

 

The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time during the two-day
period following the Determination Date if the following two conditions
are satisfied:

 

 

(1) the Average Closing Price shall be less than the product of .80 and the
Starting Price; and

 

 

(2) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the "Parent Ratio")
shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Index Price on
the Determination Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date (as defined
below) and subtracting .20 from such quotient (such number being referred to
herein as the "Index Ratio").

 

 

It is provided, however, that if the Company elects to exercise its
termination right pursuant to this Section 9.1(g), it shall give prompt
written notice to Parent and that such notice of election to terminate may be
withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned two-day period. During the
period commencing with its receipt of such notice and ending at the Effective
Time, Parent shall have the option of increasing the Exchange Ratio in a
manner such, and to the extent required, so that the condition set forth in
either clause (1) or (2) above shall be deemed not to exist.

 

 

For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (1) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:

 

 

the Exchange Ratio is increased so that the Per Share Consideration
(calculated by using the Average Closing Price) after such increase is not
less than 80% of the Per Share Consideration calculated by using the Starting
Price in lieu of the Average Closing Price.

 

 

For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (2) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:

 

 

the Exchange Ratio is increased so that the Adjusted Parent Ratio is not less
than the Index Ratio.

 

 

If Parent makes this election, within such period, it shall give prompt
written notice to Company of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio,
whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 9.1(g)
and this Agreement shall remain in effect in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so
modified), and any references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio after giving effect to
any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 9.1(g).

 

 

If Parent declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the Starting Date and the Determination Date, the prices
for the common stock of Parent shall be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 9.1(g);

 

 

(h) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn
or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its
shareholders referred to in Section 7.5 hereof in order to accept a Superior
Proposal; or

 

 

(i) by the Company, in order to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, provided that the Company complies with the
provisions of Section 7.4 in connection with such Superior Proposal.

 

 

9.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) Sections 7.3(b), 7.4(e),
9.2 and 10.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 

 

9.3. Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the shareholders of either the
Company or Parent; provided, however, that after any approval and adoption of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company's
shareholders, there may not be, without further approval and adoption of such
shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or
changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to the
Company shareholders hereunder other than as contemplated by this Agreement.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

 

9.4. Extensions; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

10.5. Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or
Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date hereof" and
terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be
deemed to refer to November 7, 2008. No provision of this Agreement shall be
construed to require the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates to take any action that would violate any
applicable law, rule or regulation.

 

 

10.6. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 

 

10.7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreements.

 

 

10.8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard
to any applicable conflicts of law.

 

 

10.9. Enforcement of Agreement. The parties hereto agree that money damages
or any other remedy at law would not be a sufficient or adequate remedy for
any actual or threatened breach or violation of, or default under, this
Agreement by any of them and that, in addition to all other available
remedies, each aggrieved party shall be entitled, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to an injunction restraining such actual or
threatened breach, violation

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

or default and to any other equitable relief, including specific
performance, without bond or other security being required.

 

 

10.10. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

 

10.11. Publicity. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or
otherwise required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, so long as
this Agreement is in effect, neither Parent nor the Company shall, or shall
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make
any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 

 

10.12. Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without

enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
