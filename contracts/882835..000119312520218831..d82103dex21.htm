performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the
Parties hereby agree as follows:

 

 _ARTICLE I_

_THE MERGER _

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, and applicable provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving

"Surviving Corporation."

 

1.2 _Closing_.

(a) Subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver by the person
entitled to the benefit thereof of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE V_ ,
the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place as promptly
as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Parties hereto, but no later than three (3) Business Days following
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE V_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver, if permissible, by the person entitled
to the benefit thereof of those conditions); _provided_ that, without limiting
the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the Parent, the Closing

of the proceeds from the New Debt Financing. In lieu of an in-person meeting,

(b) At the Closing, (i) the Parties hereto shall cause a Certificate of
Merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Annex_ __ _ B_, to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Certificate
of Merger"), in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL; (ii)
Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with a paying agent
selected jointly by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing (the
"Paying Agent") pursuant to a paying agent agreement to be dated as of the
Closing Date and substantially in the form of _Annex C_ (the "Paying Agent
Agreement"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
in cash equal to the Aggregate Stockholder Proceeds (the "Payment Fund");
(iii) Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Company, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal to
the Aggregate Option Proceeds (less any cash on hand at the Company and its
Subsidiaries, provided that such aggregate amount is sufficient to make the
payments required by _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)_); (iv) Parent shall pay or cause
to be paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, all unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses in accordance with

 



-6- 

    

 written instructions delivered by the Company at least two Business Days

Parent shall pay or cause to be paid, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, all Payoff Indebtedness (if any) in accordance with customary
debt payoff letters (the "Payoff Letters") providing for the release and
termination of all Liens securing any such Payoff Indebtedness upon payment
in full of all amounts due and owing with respect to the Payoff Indebtedness,
with such Payoff Letters delivered to the Parent at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, and (vi) the Parties shall duly execute and
deliver the Paying Agent Agreement.

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall become effective on the date and
time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware or at such other date and time as is agreed
between Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").
Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.13_ of this Agreement, from and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and
all of the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective
Time, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that (i) the name of the corporation shall be the
name of the Company, (ii) the provisions related to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses shall be at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions as those
set forth in the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and as made available to Parent and
(iii) the identity of the incorporator shall be deleted.

 

(b) Unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective
Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated in their
entirety to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) the name of the corporation shall
be the name of the Company and (ii) the provisions related
to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses shall be at least
as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions as those set forth in the bylaws of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and as made available to Parent.

 



-7- 

    

1.5 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) _Directors_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become, at the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold the office of a director of the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL and the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier resignation
or removal.

 

(b) _Officers_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become, at the Effective Time, the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the provisions of the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly appointed
and qualified, or until their earlier resignation or removal.

1.6 _Effect of Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations and
Company Options_.

(a) _Effect on Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
the holder(s) of shares of common stock of Merger Sub, each share of common
stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one (1) validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation,
which, subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)(ii)_ (if applicable), shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub, if any, evidencing
ownership of any such shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter
evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) _Effect on Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock:

(i) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares that are
Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares) shall be cancelled and extinguished and
be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the Per Share Consideration as set forth on the
Allocation Schedule; _provided_ that no Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive any of the Merger Consideration unless and until such Stockholder has
executed and delivered to the Paying Agent the Letter of Transmittal and
otherwise complied with _Section_ __ _ 1.8(a)_;

 



-8- 

    

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a Subsidiary of the Company or Parent
shall be converted into such number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each
such Subsidiary of the Company and Parent owns the same percentage of the
outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as it owned in the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by the Company (whether as treasury
stock or otherwise) or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, together with the shares referred to in _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)(ii)_, an
"Excluded Share") shall be cancelled and extinguished as of the Effective
Time.

Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive
the applicable Per Share Consideration as provided in this _Section_ __ _
1.6(b)_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of certificates (the "Company Stock Certificates") that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the
right to receive, upon surrender of such Company Stock Certificates in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.8_, the applicable Per Share Consideration.

(c) _Effect on Company Options_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall assume any Company Option in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Instead, each Company Option shall be
treated as follows:

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option which is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to receive an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product of (i) the Option
Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Option (such payment to be net of applicable
withholding Taxes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_); _provided_ that no
Optionholder will be paid his or her portion of the Option Consideration until
he or she has executed and delivered to the Company an option cancellation
agreement substantially in the form of _Annex I_ attached hereto (an "Option
Cancellation Agreement") and otherwise complied with  _Section_ __ _
1.8(a)_). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to the holder of each such Company
Option, as promptly as practicable after the Closing, the portion of the
Aggregate Option Proceeds to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)_.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option that is outstanding
and unexercised (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting that
occurs at or prior to the Effective Time or otherwise in connection with, or
as a result of, the consummation of the Merger) as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without consideration.

 



-9- 

    

(iii) At or prior to the Effective Time and subject to  _Section_ __ _
1.6(c)(ii)_, the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary
(including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof and any necessary consents from the
holders of the Company Options) to terminate any plan or agreement governing
the Company Options, as amended from time to time; _provided_ that such
resolutions and other actions may be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger and shall be of no effect if this Agreement is terminated. The Company
shall provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment
upon, all resolutions and other written actions as may be required to
effectuate the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)(iii)_.

(d) _Withholding Taxes_. The Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code,
or any provision of state or local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Person intending to deduct or withhold shall use reasonable best
efforts to notify such Persons of any amounts otherwise payable to such
Persons that it intends to deduct and withhold at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the due date for any relevant payment, other than required
withholdings (i) in respect of Vested Company Options or other compensatory
payments for income, employment and similar Taxes or (ii) pursuant to Section
1445 of the Code if the Company has not provided certification pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.11_, and the Person intending to withhold with respect to
such payments shall provide reasonable details regarding the provisions of
Law that requires such deduction or withholding and the Parties shall work
together in good faith to minimize such deduction or withholding. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable party in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all compensatory amounts subject
to payroll reporting and withholding payable pursuant to or as contemplated by
this Agreement shall be payable as promptly as possible through the Surviving
Corporations payroll in accordance with applicable payroll procedures.

1.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has properly demanded
and perfected his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the consideration for Company Common Stock set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 1.6(b)_, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights with
respect to such Dissenting Shares as are provided by the DGCL.

 



-10- 

    

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_, if any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL, then, as
of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the consideration for Company Common Stock, as
applicable, set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares pursuant to the
exchange procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.8_, including delivery of a
duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal. Parent shall be entitled
to retain (or receive from the Paying Agent) any Merger Consideration that
otherwise would have been paid in respect of the Dissenting Shares pending
resolution of the claims of such holders, and, subject to this _Section_ __ _
1.7_, no Securityholder shall be entitled to any portion of such retained
Merger Consideration.

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
written notice of any written notice, written threat or written intent (or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any other notice, threat or intent) to demand
appraisal under the DGCL or demand for appraisal under the DGCL received by
the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and control (
_provided_ that such control is in compliance with applicable Law and
does not give rise to any liability or obligation of the Company in the event
the Closing is not consummated) all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer to
settle or settle any such demands and shall not use an estimate of fair value
in an amount greater than the applicable Per Share Consideration in any
offer of payment, in each case, without Parents prior written consent.

1.8 _Mechanics of Exchange_.

 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. The Paying Agent shall act as exchange and paying
agent hereunder for the payment and delivery of amounts payable in exchange
for shares of Company Common Stock due hereunder. As promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, the Company shall mail to each Stockholder on the date
hereof and from time to time hereafter a letter of transmittal (the "Letter
of Transmittal") in the form attached hereto as _Annex_ __ _ D_. The Letter
of Transmittal shall specify that, in the event of a termination of this
Agreement prior to the Closing pursuant to _ARTICLE VI_ , the Paying Agent
shall return such certificates to the holder of record. Upon surrender of a
Company Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal, subject to the conditions set forth in, and
otherwise in accordance with this Agreement and the Letter of Transmittal, the
holder of such Company Stock Certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount in cash of the Aggregate Stockholder Proceeds to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_ for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock
Certificate(s) (such payment to be net of applicable withholding Taxes
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_). Company Stock Certificate(s) so
surrendered shall be cancelled at the Effective Time. To the extent that any
Company Stock Certificate(s) are held in escrow, the Surviving Corporation
shall direct such Company Stock Certificate(s) to be released from escrow and
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation promptly following the
Effective Time. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay such amounts, by
wire transfer of immediately

 



-11- 

    

 available funds (or by check if the holder (or beneficial holder in the case
of Company Common Stock represented by Company Stock Certificate(s) held in
escrow) of a Company Stock Certificate does not provide wire instructions),
to the holder (or beneficial holder in the case of Company Common Stock
represented by Company Stock Certificate(s) held in escrow) of each such
Company Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) (i)
immediately following the Effective Time for any holder who has delivered such
holders Company Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits or loss in lieu thereof)
and a duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal at least
three (3) Business Days prior to Closing and (ii) otherwise, within two (2)
Business Days after the Paying Agents receipt of such Company Stock
Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), together with a
duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Company Stock Certificate will be deemed for all
corporate purposes to evidence only the right to receive the amount of cash
into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall be so exchanged. If
payment is to be made to a Person (other than the record or registered
Securityholder), it shall be a condition to such payment that any certificates
representing the Company Common Stock so surrendered will be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required as a result of such payment being made to a Person (other than
the record or registered Securityholder) or establish to the satisfaction of
the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(b) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates with respect to such
certificate or instrument, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate the applicable Per Share
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.6(b)_, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Company Stock Certificates.

 

(c) _Payment Fund_. Parent shall cause the Payment Fund to be held (i)
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) for the benefit of the Stockholders as
set forth herein. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent; _provided, however,_ that
(i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making
the payments required by _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_, and following any losses
Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock as set forth herein in the
amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that
could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and
(iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States
of America with maturities of no more than thirty days or guaranteed by the
United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America.

 



-12- 

    

 In the event the Payment Fund is insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or
cause to be deposited, an additional amount of immediately available funds
with the Paying Agent equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make
such payment. Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to
the holders of Company Stock Certificates on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any Stockholder
who has not theretofore delivered or surrendered such Stockholders Company
Stock Certificate(s) to the Paying Agent, subject to applicable Law, shall
thereafter look as a general creditor only to Parent for payment of such
Stockholders entitlement to the applicable Per Share Consideration, subject
to compliance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.8(a)_, including the
due surrender of any Company Stock Certificates and the delivery of a Letter
of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any amount
payable upon surrender of any Company Stock Certificate.

(d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.8_, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Person shall be liable to a holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by a Securityholder after five years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of
Company Common Stock.

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. If Company Stock
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer
following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the
applicable Per Share Consideration, as provided for in _Section_ __ _
1.6(b)_, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Company Stock Certificates.

1.9 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, then the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are hereby authorized,
empowered and directed in the name of and on behalf of the Company to execute
and deliver any and all things and to take such action as is necessary
or desirable to vest or to perfect or confirm title to such property or
rights in the Surviving Corporation.

pursuant to applicable Law, the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation of the Company (the "Charter"), the Bylaws or any other
Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to adopt
this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the Transactions.

the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts,

nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent that
the concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction

the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar Organizational
Documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, each as amended and in effect on

audited consolidated balance sheets and the related audited consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018
and December 31, 2019, and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of May 31, 2020 (the "Balance Sheet Date")
and the related unaudited consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the five month period then ended (the financial statements referred to in
items (i) and (ii), collectively, the "Company Financial Statements"). Except
as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company Financial Statements have been prepared, in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated and consistent
with each other, except for year-end adjustments (which are not reasonably
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries) and the absence
of footnotes in the case of the unaudited Company Financial Statements. The
Company Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated
therein, subject, in the case of the unaudited interim Company Financial
Statements, to normal year-end adjustments (which are not reasonably

length, bona fide transactions.

material respects accurate books and records reflecting their assets and
Liabilities and maintain proper and adequate internal accounting controls
which provide reasonable assurance that, in all material respects, (i)
transactions are executed with managements authorization and (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP and to
maintain accountability for the consolidated assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2017, there have been no significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
internal controls over financial reporting that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect in any material respect the ability of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to record, process, summarize and report financial data or
material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting and, to the
Companys Knowledge, there has been no fraud, whether or not material, with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries that involved management or other
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have a significant role in
the Companys and its Subsidiaries internal controls over financial
reporting.

2.10 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities, except Liabilities (a) to the extent
reflected or reserved against in the Company Financial Statements; (b) that
are expressly contemplated by this Agreement; (c) incurred in the ordinary
course of business after the Balance Sheet Date; (d) under an executory
portion of a Contract that have not yet been performed (excluding any
Liabilities arising from breaches of such Contracts or defaults thereunder);

has been conducted, in all material respects, in the ordinary course of
business and (ii) there has not been any event, occurrence, development or
state of circumstances or facts that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Forbearance_. Except (i) for the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, and (iii) for any reasonable actions taken, or
omitted to be taken, in response to COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures, since
December 31, 2019 through the date of this Agreement to the extent that such
action is reasonable and necessary to protect the health and safety of
individuals who are officers, directors, employees or other service providers
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or

 



-20- 

    

 individuals who interact with any of the foregoing in connection with the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries) or otherwise reasonably required
to protect the business, operations, assets and financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, the Company has not taken any action that would
be prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ if taken or proposed to be taken after
the date of this Agreement.

each case, requires: (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose
or license any proprietary source code that embodies material Company
Intellectual Property, or (ii) any product of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to be made available at no charge, for the purpose of making

3.9 _Financial Capability_. Parent has delivered to the Company true,
complete and fully executed copies of commitment letters and related fee
letters (which in the case of such fee letters may be subject to redaction in

Financing Sources confirming the commitments to provide Parent with the New
Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, the
Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any material

been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in any material respect.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, the

Commitment Letter delivered to the Company contains all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to fund the full
amount of the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. Other than
the redacted fee letters provided to the Company as of the date hereof and
other than the customary engagement letters with respect to the New Debt
Financing, there are no other fee letters, engagement letters, side letters,
agreements, contracts or other arrangements relating to the Debt Commitment
Letter. As of the date hereof, (i) no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the

 



-40- 

    

 part of Parent under any term, or a failure of any condition or inability to
satisfy any conditions precedent to funding the full amount of the New Debt
Financing, of the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise result in any portion
of the New Debt Financing to be unavailable or delayed and (ii) Parent does
not have reason to believe that it would be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any condition of the Debt Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by
it or that any portion of the New Debt Financing contemplated thereby will be
unavailable to Parent at the Closing. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter
that are due and payable on or before the date of this Agreement. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or to
any of its other obligations under this Agreement (including consummating the
Merger) that Parent and/or Merger Sub (or the Surviving Corporation) obtain
financing for or related to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

3.10 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay
or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is solvent as of the date of this Agreement, and each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger
Consideration, the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the payment of all related fees and expenses and assuming (x)

true and correct, (y) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the
Parent and Merger Subs obligation to effect the Closing hereunder and (z)
that the representations and warranties in _ARTICLE II_ of this Agreement are
true and correct (for this purpose, such representations and warranties shall
be true and correct without giving effect to any materiality or Company
Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained therein), be solvent at and
immediately after the Effective Time. As used in this _Section_ __ _ 3.10_,
the term "solvent" means, with respect to a particular date, that on such
date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of Parent and Merger
Sub (and, after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
(on a consolidated basis) will exceed their debts, (b) Parent and Merger Sub
(and, after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) (on a

promptly and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours following

(b) Within 15 Business Days following the receipt by the Company of

sufficient to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company shall, in
accordance with applicable Law, including Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL,

statement (the "Information Statement") to each holder of Company Common Stock
that has not theretofore executed the Stockholder Written Consent (i)
notifying him, her or it that (1) action has been taken by less than
unanimous written consent of the holders of Company Common Stock, (2) this
Agreement was duly adopted and approved by unanimous consent of the Board of
Directors of the Company and the unanimous recommendation of the Companys
Board of Directors that such holders vote their shares of Company Common Stock
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (3) appraisal rights are available pursuant

reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall at all relevant times be in
compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL and other applicable Laws; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent shall in no way be responsible for any of the
content of the Information Statement except for information supplied in
writing by Parent expressly for inclusion therein.

 

(c) Within fifteen (15) Business Days following the date hereof, the Company
shall deliver to Parent (or its advisors) a true and correct report
specifying whether and to what extent the consummation of the Transactions
will result in payment of any amount that could, individually or in
combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code; _provided_ , _however_
, that to the extent that

 



-46- 

    

 any contract, agreement or plan is entered into between Parent, the Company
or any of their Affiliates and a Disqualified Individual (as defined in
Section 280G of the Code and the applicable regulations thereunder), or to
which a Disqualified Individual obtains a legally binding right to the extent
such contract, agreement or plan is not actually executed, in all cases, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before
the Closing Date (the "Parent Arrangements"), Parent shall provide a copy of
such contract, agreement or plan to the Company at least fifteen (15) days
before the Closing Date and shall cooperate with the Company in good faith in
order to update the calculations in order to determine the value (for the
purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any payments or benefits granted or
contemplated therein that could constitute a "parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Code (collectively, the "Section 280G Payments"). Such
report, when delivered by the Company, shall be deemed a representation and
warranty by the Company as to the information set forth therein, with the
same effect as if it were set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.17_ hereof. As
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and, if
practicable, concurrently with the distribution of the Information Statement,
the Company shall submit to its stockholders, for approval (in a manner and
with a disclosure document reasonably satisfactory to Parent) by a vote of
such shareholders as is required pursuant to Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "280G Shareholder Vote"),
any such payments or other benefits that may, separately or in the aggregate,
constitute "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder), such that, if the 280G
Shareholder Vote is received approving such payments and benefits, such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments"
under Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such shareholder
approval in conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (the "Section 280G Shareholder Approval") prior to the
Closing Date. Prior to such 280G Shareholder Vote, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, from each person who is a Disqualified
Individual and who might otherwise have, receive or have the right or
entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, a
written waiver (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent)
pursuant to which such person agrees to waive any and all right or entitlement
to such parachute payment, to the extent such payment would not be deductible
pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. Such waivers shall cease to have any
force or effect with respect to any item covered thereby to the extent the
280G Shareholder Vote for such item is obtained. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Parent that (A) the Section 280G Shareholder Approval has been obtained, or
(B) the Section 280G Shareholder Approval was not obtained and as a
consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided
to the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G
Payments, pursuant to the applicable waivers of those payments and/or
benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company or any of its
Affiliates shall be deemed to be in breach of the covenants set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.3(c)_ if the process set forth herein is ultimately
determined to be invalid, if such invalidation is due to any inaccuracy or
incompleteness in any respect of any such amounts and/or information provided
by Parent with respect to the Parent Arrangements.

 



-47- 

    

4.4 _Payment Spreadsheet_ _; Allocation Schedule_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.4(b)_, the Company shall deliver to Parent a

(for the sake of clarity, not in her individual capacity and without any
personal Liability on her part) setting forth the Companys good faith
estimate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of:

 

(i) the calculation of the Merger Consideration, including each component

such Optionholder.

(b) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to
Parent, a draft of the Allocation Schedule and Payment Spreadsheet along with
support documentation and, to the extent practicable, final invoices for the
calculations and amounts set forth on such Payment Spreadsheet. Parent shall
be entitled to review, and the Company shall consider in good faith the
reasonable comments of Parent on, the draft Payment Spreadsheet. The Payment
Spreadsheet delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.4(a)_ shall be based upon
the draft Payment Spreadsheet delivered pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
4.4(b)_ after the Companys good faith consideration of the reasonable
comments of Parent thereon.

 



-48- 

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
knowledge possessed or acquired by or on behalf of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, it is expressly
acknowledged and agreed that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to rely on the allocation of
the Merger Consideration among the Securityholders set forth in the Allocation

correctness thereof, and to make payments in accordance therewith, and in no
event shall Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates have any liability to any Person (including any of the
Securityholders) in connection with any claims relating to any misallocation
of the Merger Consideration among the Securityholders set forth in the
Allocation Schedule, any determination by the Company in connection therewith,
or payments made by any Person (including Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent and their respective Affiliates) in accordance
therewith.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the
properties, Contracts, books and records and senior management of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company may restrict
or otherwise prohibit access to any properties, personnel, documents or
information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law (including any COVID-19
Measure) requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
such properties, personnel, documents or information, (ii) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege applicable to such documents or information, or (iii) access to a

otherwise bound would violate or cause a material default under, or give a
third party the right terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract;
_provided_ that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
and obtain any third partys consent to disclosure of such documents and
information. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall notify Parent that
it is withholding information based on this section and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to communicate the applicable information
to Parent in a way that would not violate the applicable Law (including any
COVID-19 Measure), Contract or obligation or to waive such a privilege and
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take any actions as
may reasonably be requested by Parent to implement such alternate arrangements
in order to allow Parent access to such information to the fullest
extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein or otherwise, prior to the Closing,
without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not contact any
vendor, partner or customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (

contact does not reference or otherwise relate to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated hereby and is

present during any such contact in the event that it consents to such
contact. All access and investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_
shall be coordinated through the Companys General Counsel and shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any access
to the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject
to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and
shall not include the right to perform invasive testing.

the Vista Best Practices or other Sponsor Confidential Information by any
person or entity, other than such Permitted Recipients, (iv) none of Parent,
Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or their respective directors,
managers, officers, employees or agents shall request access to the Vista Best
Practices or other Sponsor Confidential Information and (v) Parent, Merger Sub
and their Affiliates shall have no rights in the Vista Best Practices or

securities exchange; _provided_ that such approval shall not be required for

Party a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon and shall consider such
comments in good faith.

practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event later than three
(3) Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement;
_provided_  that, in the event the FTC and/or the DOJ is closed or not

use its or their reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other Person with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to
occur expeditiously, but in no case later than the Termination Date; 
_provided_ that (x) such reasonable best efforts shall not include, effecting
or committing to, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, (and
in no event shall any Party be required under any provision of this Agreement
to (and, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not) do any of the foregoing in respect of) (i) the sale,

Termination Date or the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)_, Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub or

with a material portion of the Companys operations ( _provided_ , that with
respect to Parent, "HSR Affiliate" shall mean an "Affiliate" or "Associate"
(each as defined in 16 CFR 801.1(d)) of Parent) or (ii) acquire equity or
assets of any Person if the entering into a definitive agreement relating to,
or the consummation of, such acquisition would reasonably be expected to (x)
impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining,
any permits, orders or other approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary
to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (y) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority
entering, issuing or granting an Order that has the effect of making the
Transactions illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting or
otherwise preventing the consummation of the Transactions, or (z) delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly inform the other of any material communication from any Governmental
Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
connection with any filings or investigations with, by or before any
Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any proceedings initiated by a private party.

a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws with respect to
which any such filings have been made, then such party shall make, or cause to
be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with such
other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. In

the other hand, shall (i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all
meetings with any Governmental Authority relating to the Merger, (ii) give
each other an opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) keep

review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other
with respect to, all written communications (including any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions) with a
Governmental Authority regarding the Merger; _provided, however_ , that

rights to participate or provisions of information by one party to the other
may be made on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable
Law or as appropriate to protect confidential business information.

(d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in good faith to promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ should be made, and whether any
other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 4.8_ should be obtained, from any Governmental Authority under
any other applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants contained in
_Section_ __ _ 4.7_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violating any Law or
Order, or if any Law or Order is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by
a Governmental Authority which would make illegal, or would otherwise prohibit
or materially impair or delay, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent, and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall cooperate in all respects with each
other and contest any such action or proceeding and use all reasonable
efforts to have vacated or otherwise lifted any such Law or Order, subject to
the proviso to the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.8(a)_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in

any of their respective current or former directors and officers and 

 



-54- 

    

 any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Indemnitees") that have
been made available to Parent. In addition, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six-year period, such
provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
that would violate the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.9(a)_
except as required by applicable Law.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to
obtain and fully pay for a six-year "tail" prepaid policy (the "DandO Tail
Policy") on the Companys current directors and officers

of such DandO Tail Policy shall be treated as a Company Transaction Expense)
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit ratings as
the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to officers and
directors liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. The
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to
honor their respective obligations thereunder, for so long as such "tail"
policy shall be maintained in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Company expend for such DandO Tail Policy an
amount in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last
full fiscal year for the Existing Policies, which amount is set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 4.9_.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the obligations set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.9_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner that adversely affects any DandO Indemnitee (or any other person who
is a beneficiary under the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section_ __ _
4.9(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written
consent of such affected DandO Indemnitee or other person who is a beneficiary
under the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 4.9(b)_ (and their
heirs

 



-55- 

    

 and representatives). Each of the DandO Indemnitees or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 4.9(b)_
(and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 4.9_, with full rights of enforcement as
if a party thereto. The rights of the DandO Indemnitees (and other persons who
are beneficiaries under the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _
4.9(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section_ __ _ 4.9_
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such persons may have under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of
or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity).

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance

Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 4.9_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

4.10 _Termination of Management Agreement and Other Contracts_. At or prior to
the Closing, the Company shall cause all Contracts and accounts between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Interested Party,
on the other hand, to be terminated, released, canceled, paid or otherwise
settled prior to the Closing, without any continuing Liability of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder, in all cases excluding (i) any
employment, severance, expense reimbursement or other similar arrangements
with officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
indemnification arrangements with directors, officers or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) any of the Transaction Documents and
(iv) Contracts set forth on _Section_ __ _ 4.10(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. Without limiting the foregoing, no payments whatsoever are
owed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Contracts set

-56- 

    

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date (or, if earlier, until
the date of termination of the relevant Employee) Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to,
provide the individuals who immediately prior to the Effective Time are
Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and who continue in such
capacity immediately following the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing
Employee") salary or wage level, bonus opportunity and other compensation
opportunity (excluding severance, equity-based compensation and benefits and
long-term incentives) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(b) For all purposes under the benefit and compensation plans, programs,
agreements and arrangements of Parent (excluding equity based plans), the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, each Continuing
Employee shall receive full credit for such Continuing Employees years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time to the
same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, prior to the Effective
Time, to credit for such service for purposes of eligibility and vesting and
for determining vacation accrual, severance benefits and other benefits under
any similar or comparable Employee Plan (except not for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit plan or retiree medical plan or to the
extent that such credit would result in a duplication of benefits). In
addition, for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work requirements of each health
plan that replaces an Employee Plan that is a health plan to be waived or
satisfied for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to
the extent waived or satisfied under the analogous Employee Plan as of the
Effective Time, and (ii) cause all eligible expenses incurred by each
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of such Employee Plan ending on the date such Continuing
Employees participation in the corresponding replacement health plan begins
to be taken into account under such plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for such plan year.

applicable Subsidiary (or applicable committee thereof) to terminate any and
all plans intended to include a Section 401(k) of the Code arrangement (each,
a "401(k) Plan"). In connection with the termination of the 401(k) Plan,
Parent shall permit each Continuing Employee to immediately participate in a
401(k) plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates and to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code and including all participant loans in cash in
an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account
balance distributed to each such Continuing Employee from the 401(k) Plan to
such "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) of Parent or any of its Affiliates. The Company shall provide
Parent with evidence that each 401(k) Plan has been terminated pursuant to
resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of the Companys
applicable Subsidiary (or applicable committee thereof), which resolutions
shall be subject to the review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of Parent.

 



-57- 

    

(d) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.13_, whether express or implied, shall:
(i) confer upon any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates

right to employment or continued employment or any term or condition of, or
restrict the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate the employment or service
of any Person at any time and for any or no reason; (ii) be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement; (iii) limit the ability of Parent,

Affiliates to amend, modify, or terminate any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; or (iv) create any
third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person (including any
Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) other than the Parties to
this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any reasonable
action taken, or omitted to be taken, by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in response to COVID-19 or any COVID-19
Measure shall not be deemed to be a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 4.13_ to
the extent that such action is reasonable and necessary to protect the health
and safety of individuals who are officers, directors, employees or other
service providers to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or individuals
who interact with any of the foregoing in connection with the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) or otherwise reasonably required to protect the
business, operations, assets and financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any associated

the Surviving Corporation with respect to the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement.

 



-58- 

    

4.16 _Tax Return Preparation_. The Company shall prepare and timely file, or
shall cause to be prepared and timely filed any Tax Return that is required
to be filed by or with respect to the Company on or prior to the Closing Date

reasonably requested by Parent that are customary in connection with
the arrangement and implementation of the New Debt Financing, including
Parents expectation of a concurrent or subsequent public offering of Parents
debt securities. Such reasonable best efforts by the Company shall be limited
to, at the reasonable request of Parent and Merger Sub, (i) cooperation in

Affiliates (other than the Company)), (v) to the extent constituting a
condition to any of Parents Debt Financing Sources obligations under the
debt commitment letter associated with the New Debt Financing, and as
reasonably requested by Parent, using reasonable best efforts to facilitate
the pledging of collateral and the granting of security interests in
connection with the New Debt Financing; _provided_ that no such action shall
be effective until the Closing, (vi) facilitating the execution and delivery
at the Closing of definitive documents reasonably related to the New Debt
Financing on the terms contemplated by the debt commitment letter associated
with the New Debt Financing, in connection with the authorization of the New

Closing ( _provided_ that all such authorization, execution and delivery shall

any commitment, financing or other fees or reimburse any expenses or to
approve the execution or delivery of any document or certificate in connection
with the New Debt Financing, (iv) deliver any financial statements or other
information for any period that is not otherwise specifically required
hereunder, (v) take any action that will conflict with or violate their

expected to result in any officer, director, employee, agent, attorney,
accountant or advisor of the

 



-60-

to any matters related to the New Debt Financing (other than any such
personal liability resulting from such Persons actual fraud or willful
misconduct), (vii) take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause

or employees to incur any liability) under the New Debt Financing prior to
the Closing Date or (ix) cause the delivery of any legal opinions, any

fraud or willful misconduct) to any Person under or in connection with, the
arrangement of the New Debt Financing that Parent may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives, directors, officers, employees, representatives
and advisors (including legal, financial and accounting advisors) from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, costs or expenses suffered or

connection therewith. If this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with its terms for any reason, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for
all out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with cooperation provided for in this _Section_ __
_ 4.18_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no breach or
other failure to comply with this _Section_ __ _ 4.18_ by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective representatives shall be taken into account
for purposes of determining the accuracy of the representation and warranty
contained in _Section_ __ _ 3.9_. The Company, its Subsidiaries, and their
respective Representatives will be deemed to be in compliance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.18_, and Parent and its Representatives shall not allege
that the Company, its Subsidiaries, or their respective Representatives is or
has not been in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 4.18_, unless and until
Parent provides written notice of the alleged failure to comply specifying in
reasonable detail specific steps to cure such alleged failure in a

Business Days from receipt of such written notice. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the condition set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, as it applies to the Companys, its Subsidiaries and
their Representatives obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 4.18_, shall be
deemed satisfied if the Companys, its Subsidiaries or their
Representatives breach(es), if any, of their respective obligations under
this _Section_ __ _ 4.18_ did not cause (or was not a material factor in
causing) the failure of Parent to obtain the New Debt Financing.

 



-61- 

    

(e) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that
its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein are not
conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the New Debt Financing
or any other debt financing, the availability of any alternate debt financing,
the availability of any equity financing or receipt of the proceeds therefrom.

 

4.19 _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the New Debt Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on
the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including
the "flex" provisions contained in any fee letters), including by using
reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter,
subject to the modifications expressly permitted hereunder, (ii) negotiate as
promptly as possible, and enter into, definitive agreements relating to the
New Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing (including, as necessary, the
"flex" provisions contained in the any fee letters), (iii) satisfy or obtain
a waiver thereof and to cause their Representatives to satisfy, on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives in the Debt Commitment Letter within their respective
control, (iv) assuming that all conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter have been satisfied or waived, consummate the New Debt Financing at or
prior to the Closing, and (v) enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of its efforts to arrange the New Debt Financing.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall not agree to, or permit, without the prior
written consent of the Company, any assignment, amendment, supplement or
modification to be made to, replacement, restatement or substitution of, or
any waiver by Parent or Merger Sub of any material provision or remedy under,
the Debt Commitment Letter (including with respect to any alternative
financing intended to replace or be substituted for, in whole or in part, any
portion of the New Debt Financing) if such assignment, amendment, supplement,
modification, replacement, restatement, substitution or waiver (A) reduces the
aggregate amount of the net cash proceeds of the New Debt Financing to be
funded on the Closing Date, (B) imposes new or additional conditions
precedent or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions
precedent to the receipt of the Financing, that would reasonably be expected
to prevent, materially impede or delay the consummation of the New Debt
Financing, or (C) adversely impacts the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to the
New Debt Financing; provided, that Parent may amend, modify, assign,
supplement, substitute, replace or restate the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities,
and grant customary approval rights to such additional lenders, lead arrangers
and bookrunners, subject to the foregoing clauses (A) through (C).

 



-62- 

    

(c) In the event that any portion of the New Debt Financing becomes
unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter for any reason whatsoever, (i) Parent shall promptly so
notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain, and negotiate and enter into commitment
letters and/or definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing in
an amount sufficient when added to the portion of the New Debt Financing (if
any) and cash on hand that is available and will be funded at or prior to the
Closing, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
pay all related fees and expenses upon terms and conditions not less favorable
to the Company (with respect to conditionality) and no less favorable to
Parent in any material respect than those in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including the "flex" provisions contained in any fee letter), as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later
than the Closing Date).

4.20 _Termination of Interest Rate Hedge Confirmations_. At least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Parent the Companys good faith estimate of the
aggregate amount required to fully discharge the Companys or its
Subsidiaries obligations under the Interest Rate Hedge Confirmations
(assuming the Interest Rate Hedge Confirmations are terminated at such time).
From the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to effect the discharge
and termination of the Interest Rate Hedge Confirmations substantially
concurrently with the Closing; _provided_ that the Company will not amend
the terms of any such Interest Rate Hedge Confirmations in any material
respect without Parents written approval.

_ARTICLE V_

 

 _CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER_

 

5.1 _Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party to Effect the Merger_. The
respective obligations of each party hereto to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the
Company and Parent, at or prior to the Closing, of the following conditions:

 

(a) _No Laws_. No Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued or promulgated any Law that is in effect and has the effect
of making the Merger illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting or
otherwise preventing the consummation of the Merger.

 



-63- 

    

(b) _No Orders_. No Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued or granted any Order that is in effect and has the effect of
making the Merger illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise

all shares of Company Common Stock held, directly, or indirectly, or
otherwise controlled by each Sponsor) shall have been obtained and delivered

and effect as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except for those

_provided_ that if the impact of such failure of _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ (Company
Capitalization) (other than _Section_ __ _ 2.7(e)_) to be true and correct in
all but _de minimis_ respects is nevertheless fully reflected in the
calculation of Fully Diluted Common Shares and the Per Share Consideration

be deemed a failure to satisfy the condition set forth in this clause (i);
(ii) with respect to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ (Organization; Good Standing),
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ (Corporate Power; Enforceability), _Section_ __ _ 2.8_

be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date or such particular
date, as applicable); (iii) other than with respect to _Section_ __ _
2.7(a)-(d)_ (Company Capitalization) and the Specified Sections, the other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement

and effect as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except for those
representations and warranties which address matters only as of a particular
date, which shall have been true and correct as of such particular date),
except for any such representations and warranties where the failure to be so
true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had a Company
Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that all "Company Material
Adverse

 



-64- 

    

 Effect" qualifications and other qualifications based on the word
"material", or similar phrases contained in such representations and
warranties other than  _Section_ __ _ 2.11(a)(ii)_ shall be disregarded);

Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company on behalf of

may be waived, in writing, exclusively by the Company:

 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct
on and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except
for those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a
particular date, which shall have been so true and correct as of
such particular date), except for any such representations and warranties
where the failure to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect (it being understood that all "Parent Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications and other qualifications based on the word "material" or
similar phrases contained in such representations and warranties shall be
disregarded).

 

(b) _Covenants._ Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed and

have been satisfied or waived from and after the Closing.

5.5 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. No party may rely on the failure of

respects.

_ARTICLE VI_

 

 _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_

 

6.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by Parent or the Company if the Effective Time has not occurred before
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on February 12, 2021 (the "Termination
Date"); _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party if (i)
the failure of such party or its Affiliates to perform any of their
respective covenants or agreements under this Agreement or to act in good
faith, or the breach of such partys representations and warranties set forth
in his Agreement has been a principal cause of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated on or before such date and (ii) the other Party has filed an
Action in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ of this Agreement seeking
specific performance to cure such failure to perform pursuant to the terms of
_Section_ __ _ 8.9_;.

(c) by Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction (1) shall have enacted, issued or promulgated any Law
that is in effect and has the permanent effect of making the Merger illegal or
which has the permanent effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the
consummation of the Merger, or (ii) shall have issued or granted any Order
that is in effect and has the permanent effect of making the Merger illegal or
which has the permanent effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the
consummation of the Merger, and such Order shall have become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been a material cause
of, or resulted in the occurrence of, such restraint;

 

(d) by Parent if it is not in breach of its obligations under this Agreement
so as to prevent a condition to Closing set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_ from being satisfied and there has been a breach or
inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
_Sections 5.2(a)_ or _5.2(b)_ hereof would not be satisfied and, if such
breach is capable of being cured by the Termination Date, such breach or
inaccuracy has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days after written
notice by Parent to the Company specifying the nature of the breach and
requesting that it be cured;

 



-66- 

    

(e) by the Company if it is not in breach of its obligations under this
Agreement so as to prevent a condition to Closing set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ from being satisfied and there has been a breach
or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the conditions
set forth in _Sections 5.3(a)_ or _5.3(b)_ hereof would not be satisfied and,
if such breach is capable of being cured by the Termination Date, such breach
or inaccuracy has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days after
written notice by the Company to Parent specifying the nature of the breach
and requesting that it be cured;

 

(f) by Parent if the Stockholder Written Consent, executed by the holders of
the Company Common Stock holding at least the number and class of shares of
Company Common Stock sufficient to provide the Requisite Stockholder Approval
(inclusive of all shares of Company Common Stock held, directly, or
indirectly, or otherwise controlled by each Sponsor), has not been delivered
to Parent within twenty-four (24) hours following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, unless prior to such termination, the Company has delivered
to Parent such Stockholder Written Consent; _provided_ , however, that the
right to terminate the Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(f)_ must be
exercised, if exercisable, by the end of the fifth (5th) Business Day
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

6.2 _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ shall be effective immediately
upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the other
Parties hereto, as applicable, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made and the basis therefor described in reasonable
detail. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section_
__ _ 6.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of any Party or their respective
Representatives, if applicable; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that, the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ ( _Public Disclosure_ ), _Section_ __ _
6.3_  _(Amendment)_ , _ARTICLE VIII_ ( _General Provisions_ ), other than
_Section_ __ _ 8.13_, and this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ ( _Effect of Termination_
) shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of this _ARTICLE VI_. In addition to the
foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of
the Parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such termination shall relieve
the Parties hereto for Liability for money damages for Claims for Fraud or
Willful Breach of a covenant contained in this Agreement prior to its
termination. For purposes of clarification, the Parties agree that if Parent
and Merger Sub do not close the transactions contemplated hereby in
circumstances in which all of the closing conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 5.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ have been satisfied or waived, such event
shall be deemed to be a Willful Breach by such Persons of this Agreement. The
Company may, on behalf of its stockholders, petition a court to award money
damages in connection with any Willful Breach by Parent or

 



-67- 

    

 Merger Sub of the terms or conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
Parent and Merger Sub agree that such damages shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit
of the bargain lost by the stockholders of the Company (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and
the time value of money). The Company may, on behalf of its stockholders,
additionally enforce such award and accept damages for such breach.

 

6.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each party
hereto; _provided, however_ , that after the Requisite Stockholder Approval
has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment of this Agreement that by
Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval by such stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, no DFS Provision (or any other
provision of this Agreement the amendment or waiver of which has the effect
of modifying such DFS Provisions) may be amended, modified, terminated or
waived in a manner that is adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the
prior written consent of such Debt Financing Sources.

 

6.4 _Extension; Waiver_. Any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed,
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the
other Parties hereto, (b) waive any breaches of or inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any party
hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder.

_ARTICLE VII_

 

 _SURVIVAL; WAIVER_

7.1  _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. All
representations and warranties and all covenants and obligations that
contemplate performance prior to the Closing set forth in this Agreement and
the Company Disclosure Letter shall terminate at the Effective Time (the
"Expiration Date") and following the Effective Time no party hereto shall have
any recourse with respect to any breach of any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation (other than Claims for Fraud). The covenants and
agreements in this Agreement that contemplate performance at or following the
Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with their respective terms
only for such period as shall be required for the party required to perform
under such covenant or agreement to complete the performance required thereby
(except breaches of such covenants or agreements, which shall survive
indefinitely or until the latest date permitted by Law). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is the intention of the
Parties, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, that the Expiration Date
supersede any applicable statutes of limitations with respect to the
applicable representations and warranties.

 



-68- 

    

7.2 _Waiver_. Parent and Merger Sub (on behalf of themselves and their
Affiliates and Representatives (including, following the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation))
hereby waive, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (other than Claims for Fraud and under any Related
Agreement).

reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 

8.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not perform the provisions
of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of
it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event shall the Company be directly entitled to, or permitted to seek
directly, specific performance in respect of any of Parents Debt Financing
Sources, nor shall there be any right of the Company to directly enforce
specifically any of Parents rights under any commitment letter or any other
agreements relating to the New Debt Financing.

8.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of the Parties hereto in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or
rule (whether of the State of

 



-73- 

    

 Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the Parties
hereto agrees that, except as specifically set forth in any letter (including
any commitment letter) in connection with the New Debt Financing, all claims
or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement, the New Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules or provisions
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New
York.

8.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties hereto (i)
irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any
other process in any action or proceeding relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its
properties or assets, in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, and nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii)
irrevocably submits itself and its properties and assets to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if (and
only if) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or
does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter or is unable to timely
hear an Action as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measure, the Superior
Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware) for the purpose of any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether
based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of the Parties hereto in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement hereof; (iii) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, if (and only if) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
declines to accept or does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter or
is unable to timely hear an Action as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19
Measure, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any such action,
proceeding or counterclaim; (iv) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the venue of any such action, proceeding or counterclaim in any such court or
that such action, proceeding or counterclaim was brought in an
inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees
that it will not bring any action, proceeding or counterclaim relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a
final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided above
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Party hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of Action whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against Parents Debt Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of any debt

County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) and each party hereto submits for itself and its property with
respect to such Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court.
The parties hereto agree that process in any such suit, action or proceeding
may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in _Section_ __ _
8.1_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

8.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TR_ _IAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER AND ANY NEW DEBT FINANCING
CONTEMPLATED BY PARENT) OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV)
EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ _8.12_.

 

8.13 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_. Parent and the Company
hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation
and their current and future directors, managers, equityholders, stockholders,
members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates and each of their

Securityholders or any of their respective, direct or indirect, directors,
managers, members, stockholders, partners, officers, employees, equityholders
or Affiliates, in connection with any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding
or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any agreement
entered into in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby notwithstanding its representation of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof, and each of Parent and the Company on behalf of itself and the
Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and will not
assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising therefrom or
relating thereto. Each of Parent and the Company, for itself and the Waiving
Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications

any Securityholder and/or any director, officer, manager, member, partner,

dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
agreement entered into in connection herewith, the transactions contemplated
hereby or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, in each case prior to
the Closing Date, may be privileged communications and any corresponding
attorney-client privilege and/or expectation of client confidence belongs
solely to the Securityholders and shall be exclusively controlled thereby and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any dispute between Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and a third party (other than a party to the Agreement), on the other
hand, after the Effective Time, the Securityholders shall not waive such
attorney-client privilege without the prior written consent of Parent.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective
Time, (i) the direct and indirect holders of Company Common Stock and their
respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of the Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof (except as against third parties
(other than a party to the Agreement)), (ii) to the extent that files of
Kirkland and Ellis LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only the direct and indirect holders of Company Common Stock and their
respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and (iii) Kirkland and Ellis LLP
shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Surviving Corporation or any of the
Subsidiaries by reason of such engagement between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries or otherwise.

agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of themselves and their respective
Affiliates, that any cost estimate, projection or other prediction, any data,
any financial information or any memoranda or offering materials or
