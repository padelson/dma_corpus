iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of June
11, 2018, by and among Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida, a Florida
corporation (" _Purchaser_ ") Seacoast National Bank, a national banking
association and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (" _Purchaser
Bank_ "), First Green Bancorp, Inc., a Florida corporation (" _Company_ ")
and First Green Bank, a Florida chartered commercial bank and a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of Company (" _Selling Bank_ ").

 

 _W I T N E S S E T H_

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Parties have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective companies and their respective
shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for
in this Agreement in which Company will, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Purchaser (the "
_Merger_ "), with Purchaser as the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Entity_ ");

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement, (i) all of the directors of Company and Selling Bank (as defined
herein) and (ii) each beneficial holder of five percent (5%) or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, have entered into voting
agreements (each a " _Voting Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Voting
Agreements_ "), substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ ,
dated as of the date hereof, with Purchaser, pursuant to which each such
director or beneficial holder has agreed, among other things, to vote all of
the Company Common Stock owned by such director or holder in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, subject
to the terms of the Voting Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger; and

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Agreement is intended to be and
is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361
of the Code.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.01. _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act (the "
_FBCA_ "), at the Effective Time, Company shall merge with and into Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of Merger, substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and made a part hereof (the " _Plan of Merger_
"). Purchaser shall be the Surviving Entity in the Merger and shall continue
its existence as a corporation under the laws of the State of Florida. As of
the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease.

Section 1.02. _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time,
the articles of incorporation of Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Entity
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law. The bylaws of
Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable Law and the terms of such bylaws.

 



1 Section 1.03. _Bank Merger_. Except as provided below, immediately following
the Effective Time and sequentially but in effect simultaneously on the
Closing Date, Selling Bank shall be merged (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and
into Purchaser Bank, in accordance with the provisions of applicable federal
and state banking laws and regulations, and Purchaser Bank shall be the
surviving bank (the " _Surviving Bank_ "). The Bank Merger shall have the
effects as set forth under applicable federal and state banking laws and
regulations, and the boards of directors of the Parties shall cause the board
of directors of Purchaser Bank and Selling Bank, respectively, to approve a
separate plan of merger and merger agreement (the " _Bank Plan of Merger_ ")
in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ , and cause the Bank
Plan of Merger to be executed and delivered as soon as practicable following
the date of execution of this Agreement. Each of Purchaser and Company shall
also approve the Bank Plan of Merger in their capacities as sole shareholders
of Purchaser Bank and Selling Bank, respectively. As provided in the Bank Plan
of Merger, the Bank Merger may be abandoned at the election of Purchaser Bank
at any time, whether before or after filings are made for regulatory approval
of the Bank Merger unless such abandonment would cause a material delay in the
receipt of the Regulatory Approvals, but if the Bank Merger is abandoned for
any reason, Selling Bank shall continue to operate as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Purchaser under its name.

Section 1.04. _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of
Purchaser at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time,
continue as the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Entity
until their successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity.

 

Section 1.05. _Effective Time; Closing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties will
make all such filings as may be required to consummate the Merger and the
Bank Merger under applicable Law. The Merger shall become effective as set
forth in the articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") related to the
Merger, which will include the Plan of Merger, that shall be filed with the
Department of State of the State of Florida, as provided in the FBCA, on the
Closing Date. The " _Effective Time_ " of the Merger shall be the later of (i)
the date and time of filing of the Articles of Merger, or (ii) the date and
time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger,
which shall be no later than three (3) Business Days after all of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI (other than conditions to
be satisfied at the Closing, which shall be satisfied or waived at the
Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof or
such later date as the Parties may agree.

 

(b) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place on a date and time which shall be at or
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such date, the " _Closing Date_ ") at
the offices of Purchaser, or such other place as the Parties may mutually
agree. At or prior to the Closing, there shall be delivered by Purchaser and
Company the Articles of Merger and such other certificates and other documents
required to be delivered under Article VI.

 

Section 1.06. _Additional_ _Actions._ If, at any time after the Effective
Time, Purchaser shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
documents, assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors shall be deemed to
have granted to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, and each or any of them, an
irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver, in such official
corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law or any
other acts as are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, and the officers and directors of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, are authorized in the name of Company and its Subsidiaries or
otherwise to take any and all such action.

 



2 Section 1.07. _Reservation_ _of Right to Revise Structure._ Purchaser may at
any time and without the approval of Company change the method of effecting
the business combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent
that it deems such a change to be desirable; provided, however, that no such
change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration to
be issued to (x) Holders as Merger Consideration or (y) Holders of Company
Stock Options, each as currently contemplated in this Agreement, (ii)
reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay consummation of the
Merger, (iii) adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of Holders in
connection with the Merger or adversely limit or impact the qualification of
the Merger as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Code, or (iv) require submission to or approval of Companys shareholders
after this Agreement has been approved by Companys shareholders. In the event
that Purchaser elects to make such a change, the Parties agree to amend this
Agreement and any related documents in order to reflect any such revised
structure.

 

ARTICLE II

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

Section 2.01. _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Parties or any shareholder of Company:

 

(a) Each share of Purchaser Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following
the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock owned directly by Purchaser, Company
(including treasury shares) or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other
than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit
of customers or shares held as collateral for outstanding debt previously
contracted) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares described in  _Section_ __ _
2.01(b)_ or Dissenting Shares), shall be converted, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Article II_ , into the right to receive the
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock that is equal to the Exchange
Ratio (the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ ", also referred to herein in an
aggregate consideration amount as the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and cash in
lieu of fractional shares as specified in  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_; _provided,
however_ , that in the event the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.03(g)_ of this Agreement are not satisfied, Purchaser shall have the option
to adjust the Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Stock Consideration downward
by an amount that with Companys good faith agreement with the calculation
takes into account and is reflective of the overall shortfall between the
Company Consolidated Tangible Shareholders Equity and the Company Target
Consolidated Tangible Shareholders Equity and waive the satisfaction of such
condition set forth in Section 6.03(g) herein. At least ten (10) days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company and Purchaser shall agree on a schedule setting
forth the expected Company Consolidated Tangible Shareholders Equity amount
as of the Closing Date.

 



3 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or elsewhere to the
contrary, any holder of an outstanding share of Company Common Stock that
seeks relief as a dissenting shareholder under Section §607.1302 of the FBCA
shall thereafter have only such rights (and shall have such obligations) as
are provided therein, and the Purchaser shall be required to deliver only
such cash payments to which the Dissenting Shares are entitled pursuant to
Section §607.1302 of the FBCA. Company shall (i) give Purchaser prompt notice
upon receipt by Company of any such demands for payment of the fair value of
such shares of Company Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any
other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands or notices. If any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall forfeit such right to payment of the fair value under Section
§607.1302 of the FBCA, each holders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

Section 2.02. _Stock-Based Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take actions necessary to provide that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each valid option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and immediately be cancelled and
only entitle the holder thereof, to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied (ii) the excess,
if any, of (A) $23.00 over (B) the per shares exercise price for the
applicable Company Stock Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment (such calculation, the " _Per Share Equity Award
Consideration_ ". The payment of the Per Shares Equity Award Consideration
shall be made by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time on the
Closing Date provided the Company has received an executed stock
option cancellation agreement from the respective stock option holder prior
to the Effective Time. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
such stock option cancellation agreements prior to the Effective Time. Any
Company Stock Option that has a per share exercise price that is greater than
or equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no
consideration. Nothing herein shall prevent any holder from exercising, before
the Effective Time, any Company Stock Option that is exercisable according to
its terms and any common stock issued upon such exercise shall be converted at
the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject
to appraisal rights under the FBCA. Any shares of Company Common Stock issued
upon such exercise between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
shall be converted at the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, subject to appraisal rights under the FBCA.

 

Section 2.03. _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock, when converted in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.01,_ other than Dissenting Shares which have the rights as
provided for under the FBCA, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share previously evidencing such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such share of Company
Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Purchaser Common Stock in accordance with this Article II. At the
Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall
have no rights as, shareholders of Company, other than the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock as provided under this Article II. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
Company of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

Section 2.04. _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
no fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to each
holder of a fractional share of Purchaser Common Stock, rounded to the nearest
one hundredth of a share, an amount of cash (without interest and rounded to
the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the fractional share
interest in Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled by the Purchaser Average Stock Price.

 



4 Section 2.05. _Plan of Reorganization_. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code (and any comparable provision of state law), and that this Agreement
shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections
354 and 361 of the Code.

Section 2.06. _Exchange Procedures_. The Purchaser shall cause the Exchange
Agent as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, and _provided_
_that_ Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent
all information that is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its
obligations as specified herein to mail or otherwise cause to be delivered to
each Holder appropriate and customary transmittal materials, in a form
satisfactory to Purchaser and Company, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent, as well as instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration as provided for in this Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_
").

 

Section 2.07. _Deposit of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall (i) deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, Purchaser Common Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(c)_ in book-entry form equal to the aggregate
Purchaser Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding any
fractional share consideration) (together with, to the extent then
determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_) (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and (ii)
instruct the Exchange Agent to promptly pay such Merger Consideration and
cash in lieu of fractional shares upon receipt of a properly completed Letter
of Transmittal in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(b) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time (as well as
any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Purchaser. Any shareholders of Company who have not
theretofore complied with this _Section_ __ _ 2.07_ and  _Section_ __ _
2.08(a)_ shall thereafter look only to Purchaser for the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder
held as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for shares of Company Common Stock are not
surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which
such shares of Purchaser Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items
shall, to the extent permitted by the law of abandoned property and any other
applicable Law, become the property of Purchaser (and to the extent not in
its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the
Exchange Agent nor any Party shall be liable to any Holder represented by any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration (or any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Purchaser and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of
Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall
be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate
or Book-Entry Share, Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
tender to the custody of any court of competent jurisdiction any Merger
Consideration represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and file
legal proceedings interpleading all parties to such dispute, and will
thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

 



5 Section 2.08. _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder
will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Holders Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The
Exchange Agent and Purchaser, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to
deliver cash and/or shares of Purchaser Common Stock to a Holder to which such
Holder would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such
Holder surrenders the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing the
shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this _Article II_ ,
or, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in
such amount as may be required in each case by Purchaser or the Exchange
Agent.

(b) All shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Purchaser in respect of the
Purchaser Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of Purchaser Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of
the Purchaser Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share until such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to
the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Purchaser Common
Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Purchaser
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to surrender.

 

(c) Purchaser (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Holder such amounts as Purchaser is required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

 

Section 2.09. _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If the number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock or Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time shall be increased or decreased as a result of a stock split,
stock combination, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar transaction,
with respect to such stock, and the record date thereof shall be prior to the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted as
necessary to preserve the relative economic benefit to the Parties.

its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the

True and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation of Company (the "

where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in
all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its

reasonably be likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Company, and (iii) has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of the
Companys Subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions except for

or inspections of Company or its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be
likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Company.

in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or

are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment
under applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has

proposed, asserted or assessed, in each case, in writing, against Company or
its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened in writing disputes,

of Company and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Company and its Subsidiaries.
In the last six (6) years, neither Company nor its Subsidiaries has been
informed in writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that
Company or its Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was not
filed and to the Knowledge of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, no
basis for such a claim exists.

payable) on any of the assets of Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(g) Except as set forth on _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.10(g)_ , neither
Company nor its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing,
allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an
agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Company and its
Subsidiaries). Neither Company nor its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of
an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other
than a group the common parent of which was Company) or (ii) has any liability
for the Taxes of any person (other than Company or its Subsidiaries) under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

 

(h) Neither Company nor its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2)
years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)"
within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a

meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code.

 

(i) Neither Company nor its Subsidiaries has participated in a "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

(j) At no time during the past five (5) years has Company been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code.

(k) Neither Company nor its Subsidiaries will be required to include any
material item of income in, or to exclude any material item of deduction from,
taxable income in any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the
Closing Date as a result of any (A) change in method of accounting for a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date under Section 481 of the
Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign
income tax law), (B) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the
Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign
income tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date, (C) intercompany
transaction or excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under
Section 1502 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
tax law), (D) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or
prior to the Closing Date, or (E) prepaid amount received on or prior to
the Closing Date.

(l) Company and each of its Subsidiaries has disclosed on its Tax Returns any
position taken for which substantial authority (within the meaning of
Internal Revenue Code Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i) or comparable provision of
state or local Tax Law) did not exist at the time the return was filed.
Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any joint venture,
partnership, or other arrangement or contract which could be treated as a
partnership for federal income Tax purposes.

(m) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) do not exceed
the reserve for Tax Liability (which reserve is distinct and different from
any reserve for deferred taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and tax income) set forth on the face of the Company Financial
Statements delivered to Purchaser (rather than in any notes thereto), and (ii)
do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the
Closing Date in accordance with past custom and practice of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in filing its Tax Returns.

 



14 (n) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take
any action, or is aware of any fact or circumstances, that would be
reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.

for Taxes of another Person pursuant to a contract, as a transferee or
successor, under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or analogous provision
of state, local or foreign Law or otherwise.

(p) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Tax Return_ " means any return,
declaration, report, claim for refund, or information return or statement
relating to Taxes, including any associated schedules, forms, attachments or

Section 3.11. _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) _Company Disclosure Schedule Section_ __ _ 3.11(a)_ sets forth a true and
complete list of all Company Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Company Benefit Plans_ " means all employee benefit plans (as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ ")), whether or not subject to ERISA, and all stock
option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation,
medical, dental, disability, life insurance and other welfare benefit plans
(including paid time off policies and other material benefit policies and
procedures), supplemental retirement, retention, bonus, employment, change in
control, termination or severance plans, programs, agreements or arrangements
that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored or maintained by, or
required to be contributed to, Company or its Subsidiaries for the benefit of
any current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of
Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has any written or oral commitment to create any additional Company Benefit
Plan or to materially modify, change or renew any existing Company Benefit
Plan (any modification or change that increases the cost of such plan would
be deemed material).

(b) Company has heretofore made available to Purchaser true and complete
copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan, including any amendments thereto and
all related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding vehicles,
and (ii) to the extent applicable, (A) the most recent summary plan
description, if any, required under ERISA with respect to such Company
Benefit Plan, (B) the most recent annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed
with the IRS, (C) the most recently received IRS determination letter or IRS

in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable laws, including but not limited to ERISA, Code, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("
_HIPAA_ " _)_ and ACA and all the regulations or rules promulgated thereunder
and all material filings, disclosures and notices required thereunder. Neither
Company nor its Subsidiaries has, within the prior three (3) years, taken any
action to take corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary
correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, and neither Company nor its
Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for
correction under any such program.

 

(d) _Company Disclosure Schedule Section_ __ _ 3.11(d)_ identifies each
Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code (the " _Company Qualified Plans_ _"_ ). The IRS has issued a
favorable determination or advisory opinion letter with respect to each
Company Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been
revoked (nor has revocation been threatened in writing), and, to the knowledge
of Company, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of
any Company Qualified Plan or the related trust. No trust funding any Company
Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code.

 

(e) Neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains a Company Benefit Plan
that is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. No
Controlled Group Liability with respect to an employee benefit plan that is
not a Company Benefit Plan has been incurred by Company or its ERISA
Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of
Company, no condition exists that presents a material risk to Company or its
ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and all liabilities (i)
under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under
Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, and (iv) as a result of a failure to comply
with the continuing coverage requirements of Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ERISA
Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any entity, trade or business, any other
entity, trade or business that is, or was at the relevant time, a member of a
group described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section
4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes or included the first entity, trade or
business, or that is, or was at the relevant time, a member of the
same "controlled group" as the first entity, trade or business pursuant to
Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

(f) None of Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a _"_ _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or
a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not
under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "
_Multiple Employer Plan_ "), and none of Company, its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability to a
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that
has not been satisfied in full.

 

(g) Except as provided in _Company Disclosure Schedule Section_ __ _
3.11(g_), neither Company nor its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has
any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any
post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance
benefits for retired or former employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code or
similar state law.

 



16 (h) All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Company Benefit Plan, for any period in the prior three (3) years through the
date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of Company, as applicable, except as,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability to Company and its Subsidiaries.

(i) Except as would not, either individually or in the aggregate reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to Company or its Subsidiaries,
there are no pending or, to Companys knowledge, threatened claims (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to Companys
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably be expected to
give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against Company Benefit Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans.

(j) None of Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the
Company Benefit Plans or their related trusts, Company, its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates to any material unpaid tax or
material penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA.

 

(k) Except as provided in _Company Disclosure Schedule Section_ __ _
3.11(k)_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, cause Company or its Subsidiaries to transfer or set
aside any assets to fund any benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, or
increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any
employee, officer, director or other service provider of Company or its
Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount
paid or payable (whether in cash, in property or in the form of benefits) by
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions
in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(l) Except as provided in _Company Disclosure Schedule Section_ __ _
3.11(l)_, no Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement
of Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code. No such gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code shall
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event).

 

(m) There are no pending or, to Companys knowledge, threatened material labor
grievances or unfair labor practice claims or charges against Company or its
Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor disputes against Company
or its Subsidiaries. Neither Company nor its Subsidiaries is party to or bound
by any collective bargaining or similar agreement with any
labor organization, or work rules or practices agreed to with any labor
organization or employee association applicable to employees of Company or its
Subsidiaries and, to Companys knowledge, there are no organizing efforts by
any union or other group seeking to represent any employees of Company or its
Subsidiaries.

(n) The Company Benefit Plans that are deferred compensation plans, programs
or arrangements, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (i) are in
documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code; and (ii) to the
Knowledge of the Company, have been maintained and operated in compliance
with Section 409A of the Code, such that in either case no penalties pursuant
to Section 409A of the Code may be imposed on participants in such plans. All
Company Stock Options have been granted with a per share exercise price
or reference price at least equal to the fair market value (as defined
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code) of the underlying stock on the date of
grant.

 



17 (o) _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.11(o)_ sets forth, as of the payroll date
immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, a list of the full names of

rate of salary, and their date of hire.

 

(p) _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.11(p)_ includes a schedule of all
termination benefits and related payments that would be payable to, or
accelerated with respect to, the individuals identified thereon under any
employment agreement, change in control agreement, severance arrangements or
policies, equity incentive plan, supplemental executive retirement plans,
bonus plans, deferred compensation plans, salary continuation plans or any
material compensation arrangement, or other pension benefit or welfare benefit
plan maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the benefit of
officers, employees or directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(the " _Benefits Schedule_ ") assuming their employment or service is
terminated without cause as of October 1, 2018 and the Effective Time occurs
on such date and based on other assumptions specified in the Benefits

2016 held, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their
respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have
paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith),
except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and
holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to
pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company,
and to the knowledge of Company, no suspension or cancellation of any such
necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Company
and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not

writing or, to Companys knowledge, orally, by any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or

Section 3.15. _Risk Management Instruments_. Except as would not reasonably be
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect

prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act __ or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1,
2016 (the " _Purchaser SEC Reports_ _")_ is publicly available. No such
Purchaser SEC Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in
the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all Purchaser SEC Reports
filed or furnished under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as
to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive
officer of Purchaser has failed in any respect to make the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or
material unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the
Purchaser SEC Reports.

 



29 Section 4.07. _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Purchaser SEC Reports (including the
related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated
financial position of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal
periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case
of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and
amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC,
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto. The books and records of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
have been, since January 1, 2016, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed
Purchaser that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public
accountants of Purchaser as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with Purchaser on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, neither Purchaser
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether
due or to become due), except (i) for those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Purchaser included in
its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018
(including any notes thereto), (ii) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since March 31, 2018,
or (iii) in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership
and non-direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.
Purchaser (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Purchaser, including its Subsidiaries, is made known
to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Purchaser
by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Purchasers outside auditors and the audit committee of Purchasers Board of
Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Purchasers ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of Purchaser, any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Purchasers internal controls over
financial reporting. To the knowledge of Purchaser, there is no reason to
believe that Purchasers outside auditors and its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

 



30 (d) Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Purchaser, any director, executive officer, auditor,
accountant or representative of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Purchaser or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Purchaser or any
committee thereof or to the knowledge of Purchaser, to any director or officer
of Purchaser.

 

Section 4.08. _Taxes_.

 

(a) Each of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. All material
Taxes of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that are due have been fully and
timely paid. No deficiency with respect to a material amount of Taxes has been
proposed, asserted or assessed, in each case, in writing, against Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened in writing
disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any
material Taxes of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries. There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not
yet due and payable) on any of the assets of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within
the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related
transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the
Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a
distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code.

Section 4.09. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.

transactions contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this
Agreement, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course.

 

Section 4.10. _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there
are no pending or, to Purchasers knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to Purchasers knowledge, any of their current or former
directors or executive officers (i) that would reasonably be likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary, or (ii) reasonably likely to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay its ability to perform its covenants or
agreements under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



31 (b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the
Merger, would apply to the Surviving Entity or any of its affiliates).

 

Section 4.11. _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Purchaser and each of its
Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since January 1, 2016 held, all
licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective
properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, and to the knowledge of
Purchaser, no suspension or cancellation or any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Purchaser and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any applicable law, statute, order, rule
or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Purchaser or any of

Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Regulatory Approvals and all other consents and approvals of
any Governmental Authority required to consummate the Merger in the manner
contemplated herein, (ii) to comply with the terms and conditions of such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations, and (iii) to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as expeditiously
as practicable; _provided, however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing or

deemed to require Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to
any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of any Governmental Authority
that would reasonably be likely to have a material and adverse effect
(measured on a scale relative to Company) on the condition (financial or
otherwise), results of operations, liquidity, assets or deposit liabilities,
properties or business of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, after giving
effect to the Merger (together, the " _Burdensome Conditions_ "). Purchaser
and Company will furnish each other and each others counsel with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in
connection with any application, petition or any other statement or
application made by or on behalf of Purchaser or Company to any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each party hereto shall have the right to review and approve in advance all
characterizations of the information relating to such party and any of its
Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Authority,
other than material filed in connection therewith under a claim of
confidentiality. Purchaser shall, as soon as is practicable, but no later than
thirty (30) days after the date hereof, make all filings with Governmental

other for review a copy of the non-confidential portions of each such filing
made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
any Governmental Authority prior to its filing.

(b) Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts, and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate with Company at Companys request, to obtain all
consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations described
on _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.13(c)_. Each Party will notify the other
Party promptly and shall promptly furnish the other Party with copies of
notices or other communications received by such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries of any communication from any Person

 



40  alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and the response thereto from such Party, its Subsidiaries or its
representatives). Company will consult with Purchaser and its representatives
as often as practicable under the circumstances so as to permit Company and
Purchaser and their respective representatives to cooperate to
take appropriate measures to obtain such consents and avoid or mitigate any
adverse consequences that may result from the foregoing.

 

Section 5.07. _Publicity_. Purchaser and Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior written consent of the other
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned
or withheld; _provided, however_ , that a party may, without the prior
written consent of the other party (but after such consultation, to the extent
practicable in the circumstances), issue such press release or make such
public statements as may upon the advice of counsel be required by Law or the
rules and regulations of any stock exchanges. It is understood that Purchaser
shall assume primary responsibility for the preparation of joint press
releases relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 5.08. _Access; Current Information_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 5.21 hereof, upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Company agrees to
afford Purchaser and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other
authorized representatives such access during normal business hours at any
time and from time to time throughout the period prior to the Effective Time
to Companys and its Subsidiaries books, records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), information
technology systems, business, properties and personnel and to such other
information relating to them as Purchaser may reasonably request, and Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide any appropriate
notices to employees and/or customers in accordance with applicable Law and
Companys privacy policy and, during such period, Company shall furnish to
Purchaser, upon Purchasers reasonable request, all such other information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of Company and its
Subsidiaries that are substantially similar in scope to the information
provided to Purchaser in connection with its diligence review prior to the
date of this Agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, Company
will furnish to Purchaser copies of the board packages distributed to the
board of directors of Company or its Subsidiaries, and minutes from the
meetings thereof and all committees thereof, copies of any internal
management financial control reports showing actual financial performance
against plan and previous period, and copies of any reports provided to the
board of directors of Company or any committee thereof relating to the
financial performance, operations, or risk management of Company.

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
each of Company and Purchaser will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a regular basis with representatives of the other
Party and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of Company
and its Subsidiaries and Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, respectively.
Without limiting the foregoing, Company agrees to provide to Purchaser (i) a
copy of each report filed by Company or its Subsidiaries with a Governmental
Authority within three (3) Business Days following the filing thereof unless
it is a confidential communication with a Governmental Authority and Company
is prohibited by Law from sharing such report, (ii) a copy of Companys
monthly loan trial balance within one (1) Business Day of the end of the
month, and (iii) a copy of Companys monthly statement of condition and profit
and loss statement within five (5) Business Days of the end of the month and,
if requested by Purchaser, a copy of Companys daily statement of condition
and daily profit and loss statement, which shall be provided within two (2)
Business Days of such request.

 



41 (d) Upon reasonable advance notice, Company shall permit, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to permit, Purchaser or an environmental consulting firm
selected by Purchaser, and at the sole expense of Purchaser, to conduct such
phase I or phase II environmental audits, studies and tests on real property
currently owned, leased (to the extent permitted under the lease) or operated
by Company or its Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall indemnify Company and its
Subsidiaries for all costs and expenses associated with returning the property
of Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to its previous condition.

(e) No investigation by Purchaser or its representatives shall be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
Company set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the respective
obligations of Purchaser and Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(f) Company shall not be required to give Purchaser any documents (including
under Sections 5.08(a) and (b) herein) that disclose confidential discussions
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter
that Companys board of directors has been advised by counsel that such
distribution to Purchaser may violate a confidentiality obligation
or fiduciary duty or any Law or regulation, or may result in a waiver of
Companys attorney-client privilege. In the event any of the restrictions in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.08(f)_ shall apply, Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide appropriate consents, waivers,
decrees and approvals necessary to satisfy any confidentiality issues relating
to documents prepared or held by third parties (including work papers), and
the Parties will make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements,
including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the
confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable
Laws.

 

Section 5.09. _No Solicitation by Company; Superior Proposals_.

 

(a) Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective officers, directors and employees not to, and will not authorize
any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, affiliates or other agents of Company or Companys Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
participate in any discussions, communications or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person
(other than Purchaser) any information or data with respect to Company or
its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
release any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which Company is a party;
or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any of the Company Representatives, whether or not such
Company Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Company
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Company or otherwise, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Company. Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the Company Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing
discussions, negotiations, and communications with any Persons with respect
to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal.

 



42 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Purchaser), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Transaction_ " means (A) any
transaction or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar

through sale, lease or other disposition), directly or indirectly, 20% or more
of the assets of Company or its Subsidiaries; (C) any issuance, sale or other
disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or
any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase or securities convertible into, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the votes attached to the outstanding securities of Company or its
Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any third party or group beneficially owning 20% or more of
any class of equity securities of Company or its Subsidiaries; or (E) any
transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing transactions, or any combination of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, prior to the Company Meeting, Company may take any of the actions
described in _Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)(ii)_ if, but only if, (i) Company
has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_; (ii) the board of
directors of Company determines in good faith, after consultation with and
having considered the advice of its outside financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) it is reasonably necessary to
take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to Companys
shareholders under applicable Law; (iii) Company has provided Purchaser with
at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice of such determination;
and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data
with respect to Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, Company receives from such Person a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to Company than those contained in the
confidentiality agreement with Purchaser. Company shall promptly provide to
Purchaser any non-public information regarding Company or its Subsidiaries
provided to any other Person which was not previously provided to Purchaser,
such additional information to be provided no later than the date such
information is provided to such other party.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide,
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (i) that if consummated would result in a
third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and
Company or its Subsidiaries, the shareholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Company Common Stock
or more than 50% of the assets of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities and (ii) that
the board of directors of Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, (A) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including all
conditions contained therein and the person making such Acquisition Proposal,
and (B) taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed by
Purchaser in response to such Acquisition Proposal as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 5.09(e)_, such proposal is more favorable to the shareholders
of Company from a financial point of view than the Merger.

(c) Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Purchaser in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, Company or the Company Representatives, in
each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall
indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or
making such proposal, offer or 

 



43  information request and the material terms and conditions of any proposals
or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to such proposal,
offer, information request, negotiations or discussion, providing copies of
such materials (including e-mails or other electronic communications), except
to the extent (i) that such materials constitute confidential information of
the party making such offer or proposal under an effective confidentiality
agreement, (ii) discussions of such materials jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege or (iii) disclosure of such materials contravenes any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or decree). Company agrees that it shall keep
Purchaser informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of
any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions
(including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or
request).

(d) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.09(e)_, neither the board of directors of
Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the Company
Recommendation, in a manner adverse to Purchaser in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), fail to
reaffirm the Company Recommendation within three (3) Business Days following a
request by Purchaser, or make any statement, filing or release, in connection
with the Company Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification of the Company Recommendation); (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or
(iii) enter into (or cause Company or its Subsidiaries to enter into) any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
agreement (A) related to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 5.09(b)_) or (B) requiring Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.09(d)_ and subject to compliance with
this _Section_ __ _ 5.09(e)_, prior to the approval of the Merger at the
Company Meeting, the board of directors of Company may approve or recommend a
Superior Proposal to the Company shareholders and withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify the Company Recommendation or take any of the other actions otherwise
prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)_ (a " _Company Subsequent Determination_
") after the fifth (5th) Business Day following Purchasers receipt of a
notice (the " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from Company advising Purchaser
that the board of directors of Company has decided that a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result
from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_) constitutes a Superior Proposal
if, but only if, (i) the board of directors of Company has determined in good
faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to take such actions
would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to Companys
shareholders under applicable law, (ii) during the five (5) Business Day
period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by Purchaser (the "
_Notice Period_ "), Company and the board of directors of Company shall have
cooperated and negotiated in good faith with Purchaser to make such
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable Company to proceed with the Company
Recommendation without a Company Subsequent Determination; _provided,
however_ , that Purchaser shall not have any obligation to propose any
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and (iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into
account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been proposed
by Purchaser since its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the board
of directors of Company has again in good faith made the determination
described in clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.09(e)_ and that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material revisions to the Superior Proposal, Company shall be required to
deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to Purchaser and again comply with
the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.09(e)_, except that the Notice
Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days.

 



44 Section 5.10. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, and in
any event subject to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)(iv)_,
Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
directors, officers and employees of Company and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
arising out of actions or omissions of such persons in the course of
performing their duties for Company or such Subsidiary occurring at or before
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(each a " _Claim_ "), to the same extent as such persons have the right to be
indemnified pursuant to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Company or
similar governing documents of such Subsidiary in effect on the date of
this Agreement and to the extent permitted by any applicable Law. Purchaser
shall pay such expenses to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by the provisions of any applicable Law and Companys articles of
incorporation and bylaws. 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall promptly notify Purchaser upon learning of any
Claim, _provided that_ , failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation
of Purchaser under this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, unless, and only to the extent
that, Purchaser is materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a
consequence. In the event of any such Claim (whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time), (i) Purchaser shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof and Purchaser shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses or other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof except that if Purchaser elects not to assume such
defense, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory
to them and Purchaser, and Purchaser shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties (provided that Purchaser
shall only be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one such
counsel), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter, (iii) Purchaser shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent, and (iv) Purchaser shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if such indemnification would be
in violation of any applicable federal or state banking Laws or regulations,
or in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws,
whether or not related to banking Laws.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Purchaser will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide directors and officers
liability insurance (herein, " _D andO Insurance_") that serves to reimburse the
present and former officers and directors of Company or its Subsidiaries
(determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), which
insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party, as that
coverage currently provided by Company; _provided_ _that_ , if Purchaser is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this  _Section_ __ _
5.10_, Purchaser will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably
available (subject to the limitations described below in this _Section_ __ _
5.10(d)_); and _provided, further,_ that officers and directors of Company or
its Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance. In no event shall Purchaser be required
to expend in the aggregate for such six (6) years tail insurance a premium
amount in excess of 200% of the annual premium paid by Company for DandO
Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum D andO
Tail Premium_"). If the cost of such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO
Tail Premium, Purchaser shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate
tail insurance policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum DandO Tail Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall not provide any DandO Insurance to the extent payments under
such DandO Insurance may violate applicable law, including but not limited to
12 CFR Part 359.

 



45 (d) If Purchaser or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.10_.

 

Section 5.11. _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees who are full time employees of Company or its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") that provide
employee benefits and compensation opportunities which, in the aggregate,
are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that are made available on a uniform and non-discriminatory
basis to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any Covered
Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of Purchaser
or its Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall give the Covered Employees full credit
for their prior service with Company and its Subsidiaries (i) for purposes of
eligibility (including initial participation and eligibility for current
benefits) and vesting under any qualified employee benefit plan maintained
by Purchaser and in which Covered Employees may be eligible to participate,
and (ii) for all purposes under any welfare benefit plans, vacation plans,
severance plans and similar arrangements maintained by Purchaser.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan of Purchaser that is a health,
dental, vision or other welfare plan in which any Covered Employee is
eligible to participate, for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is
first eligible to participate, Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiary shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing
condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Purchaser or
its Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent such condition was or would have been
covered under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) recognize any
health, dental, vision or other welfare expenses incurred by such Covered
Employee and his or her covered dependents in the year that includes the
Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable copayment, deductibles
and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental,
vision or other welfare plan. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall terminate the existing coverage of any Covered Employee or his or her
dependents under any of the Company or Company Subsidiary health plans prior
to the time such Covered Employees and their dependents become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all
employees of Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary and their dependents.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to take, all actions requested by Purchaser that may be necessary
or appropriate to (i) cause one or more Company Benefits Plans to terminate as
of the Effective Time, or as of the date immediately preceding the Effective
Time, (ii) cause benefit accruals and entitlements under any Company Benefit
Plan to cease as of the Effective Time, or as of the date immediately
preceding the Effective Time, (iii) cause the continuation on and after the
Effective Time of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy relating to
any Company Benefit Plan for such period as may be requested by Purchaser, or
(iv) facilitate the merger of any 

 



46  Company Benefit Plan into any employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser
or a Purchaser Subsidiary. All resolutions, notices, or other documents
issued, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.11(c)_ shall be subject to Purchasers reasonable prior
review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If Purchaser requires Company to terminate a medical plan having a
flexible spending arrangement (" _FSA_ ") under Code Section 125, Company and
each of its Subsidiaries may continue its FSA through the Effective Time.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall be construed to limit the
right of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or
termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall
anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ be construed to require Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and
its Subsidiaries) to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee
for any fixed period of time following the Closing Date, and, except as
otherwise provided pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.03(g)_, the continued
retention (or termination) by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries of
any Covered Employee subsequent to the Effective Time shall be subject in all
events to Purchasers or its applicable Subsidiarys normal and customary
employment procedures and practices, including customary background screening
and evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment performance.

(e) If, within six (6) months after the Effective Time, unless otherwise
addressed in an employment agreement entered into with Purchaser Bank, any
Covered Employee who is terminated by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries other than
"for cause" (as defined under the policies of Purchaser and/or
its Subsidiaries) or resigns because he or she was offered a position with a
material reduction in rate of base pay or that is outside a 50-mile radius of
the current address of his or her primary work location at Company, then
Purchaser shall pay severance to such Covered Employee in an amount as set
forth in the severance policies in _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule 5.11(e)_.
Each Covered Employee entitled to severance pursuant to the foregoing shall
be required to execute a general release of claims, satisfactory to the
Purchaser, in order to receive such severance. Any severance to which a
Covered Employee may be entitled in connection with a termination occurring
more than six (6) months after the Effective Time will be as set forth in the
severance policies of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as then in effect.

(f) At the Effective Time, all accrued and unused sick time for all employees
of Company and its Subsidiaries and all accrued and unused vacation time for
all employees of Company and its Subsidiaries shall be accorded such treatment
as set forth in  _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule 5.11(f)_.

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall, as directed by Purchaser, (i)
cause the termination of each non-qualified deferred compensation, salary
continuation and supplemental executive retirement plan, program or agreement
between Company and/or its Subsidiaries and any director, officer or
employee, and (ii) pay all amounts due its officers, directors and employees
pursuant to the supplemental executive retirement plans, programs and
agreements and pursuant to the change in control provisions applicable under
any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.
_Company Disclosure Schedule 5.11(g)_ sets forth all estimated payments to be
made by Company pursuant to this Section 5.11(g).

 

(h) Purchaser shall honor the employment agreements, change in control
agreements and severance arrangements in effect as set forth in  _Company
Disclosure Schedule 3.11(a)_ , unless superseded or terminated as of the
Effective Time, with the written consent of the affected parties.

 

(i) Company shall establish a retention bonus pool to be paid to certain
designated Company employees, with such recipients, amounts of payments and
timing of payments to be agreed to in writing by the parties no later than 45
days following the date of this Agreement. The aggregate amount of such
retention bonuses payable pursuant to the retention bonus pool shall not
exceed $200,000 in the aggregate.

 



47 Section 5.12. _Notification of Certain Changes_. Company and Purchaser shall
promptly advise the other Party of any change or event having, or which could
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect or which it believes
would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its or its respective Subsidiaries
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein. From time to time
prior to the Effective Time (and on the date prior to the Closing Date),
Company will supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedules, delivered
in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter
which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in such Company
Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in such
Company Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered materially inaccurate
thereby. No supplement or amendment to any Company Disclosure Schedule or
provision of information relating to the subject matter of any Company
Disclosure Schedule after the date of this Agreement shall operate to cure any
breach of a representation or warranty made herein or have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 6.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_, as the case may be, or compliance
by Company with the respective covenants and agreements of such parties set
forth herein.

 

Section 5.13. _Transition; Informational Systems Conversion_. From and after
the date hereof, Purchaser and Company shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate the integration of Company with the business
of Purchaser following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of
the data processing and related electronic informational systems of Company
and its Subsidiaries (the " _Informational Systems Conversion_ ") to those
used by Purchaser, which planning shall include, but not be limited to, (a)
discussion of third-party service provider arrangements of Company and its
Subsidiaries; (b) non-renewal or changeover, after the Effective Time, of
personal property leases and Software licenses used by Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the systems operations; (c) retention of
outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion;
(d) outsourcing, as appropriate after the Effective Time, of proprietary or
self-provided system services; and (e) any other actions necessary and
appropriate to facilitate the conversion as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time.

 

Section 5.14. _No Control of Other Party_ __ _s Business_. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Company and Purchaser shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over its
and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 5.15. _Certain Litigation_. Each Party shall promptly advise the other
Party orally and in writing of any actual or threatened shareholder

Company or the board of directors of Purchaser related to this Agreement or
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Company
shall: (i) permit Purchaser to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of Purchaser in connection with, any proposed written or
oral response to such shareholder litigation; (ii) furnish Purchasers
outside legal counsel with all non-privileged information and documents which
outside counsel may reasonably request in connection with such
shareholder litigation; and (iii) consult with Purchaser regarding the
defense or settlement of any such shareholder litigation. Company shall give
due consideration to Purchasers advice with respect to such shareholder
litigation and shall not settle any such litigation prior to such
consultation and consideration. Company shall not settle any such shareholder
litigation if such settlement

 



48  requires the payment of money damages, without the written consent of
Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) unless the payment of
any such damages by Company is reasonably expected by Company, following
consultation with outside counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any
deductible to be paid by Company) under Companys existing director and
officer insurance policies, including any tail policy and also does not cause
the tail insurance premium contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.10(d)_ to exceed
the Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

 

Section 5.16. _Director Resignations_. Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Purchaser resignations of all

prepare the parties for the integration of the operations of Company and its
Subsidiaries with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, respectively. Without
limiting the foregoing, senior officers of Company and Purchaser shall meet
from time to time as Purchaser may reasonably request, and in any event not
less frequently than monthly, to review the financial and operational affairs
of Company and its Subsidiaries, and Company shall give due consideration to
Purchasers input on such matters, with the understanding that,
notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, neither
Purchaser nor Purchaser Bank shall under any circumstance be permitted to
exercise control of Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.
Company shall permit representatives of Purchaser Bank to be onsite at Company
to facilitate integration of operations and assist with any other coordination
efforts as necessary.

amendments, modifications or terminations of any Leases or Company Contracts
that Purchaser may request, including, but not limited to, actions necessary
to cause any such amendments, modifications or terminations to become
effective prior to, or immediately upon, the Closing, and shall cooperate
with Purchaser and use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate specific
provisions that may be requested by Purchaser in connection with any such
amendment, modification or termination.

(c) Purchaser and Company shall cooperate (i) to minimize any potential
adverse impact to Purchaser under Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805 (Business Combinations), and (ii)
to maximize potential benefits to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries under Code

Agreement, in each case consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the
SEC and applicable banking Laws and regulations.

 



49 (d) From and after the date hereof, the parties shall reasonably cooperate
with the other in preparing for the prompt conversion or consolidation of
systems and business operations promptly after the Effective Time (including
by entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and
similar agreements with the other party and appropriate service providers),
and Company shall, upon Purchasers reasonable request, introduce Purchaser
and its representatives to suppliers of Company and its Subsidiaries for the
purpose of facilitating the integration of Company and its business into that

_Section_ __ _ 6.01(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_, Company shall,
upon Purchasers reasonable request, introduce Purchaser and its
representatives to customers of Company and its Subsidiaries for the purpose
of facilitating the integration of Company and its business into that of
Purchaser. Any interaction between Purchaser and Companys and any of its
Subsidiarys customers and suppliers shall be coordinated by Company. Company

Section 5.20. _Transactional Expenses_. Company has provided in _Company
Disclosure Schedule 5.20_ a reasonable good faith estimate of costs and fees
that Company and its Subsidiaries expect to pay to retained representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
" _Company Expenses_ "). Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the aggregate amount of all Company Expenses to not exceed
the total expenses disclosed in _Company Disclosure Schedule 5.20_. Company
shall promptly notify Purchaser if or when it determines that it expects to
materially exceed its estimate for Company Expenses. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_, Company shall not incur any
investment banking, brokerage, finders or other similar financial advisory
fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other
than those expressly set forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.23_.

 

Section 5.21. _Confidentiality_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement and
prior to the consummation of the Merger, each of Purchaser and Company, and

employees, consultants and advisors have provided, and will continue to
provide one another with information which may be deemed by the
party providing the information to be non-public, proprietary and/or
confidential, including, but not limited to, trade secrets of the disclosing
party. Each Party agrees that it will, and will cause its representatives to,
hold any information so obtained pursuant to this Article V in accordance with
the terms of the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, dated as of
February 15, 2018 between the Purchaser and Company.

Section 5.22. _Tax Matters_. The Parties intend that the Merger shall qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that
this Agreement constitutes a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. The business purpose of the Merger and the
Bank Merger is to combine two financial institutions to create a strong
commercial banking franchise. From and after the date of this Agreement, each
of Purchaser and Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken
which action or failure to act is intended or is reasonably likely to prevent
the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

55  Stock Consideration (as in effect immediately before any increase in the Per

Business Day period, then it shall give prompt written notice to Company of
such election and the revised Per Share Stock Consideration, whereupon no
termination shall occur pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(i)_ and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms, provided that
any references in this Agreement to the "Per Share Stock Consideration" shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to the Per Share Stock Consideration as
increased pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(i)_, if applicable.

 

Section 7.02. _Termination Fee; Expenses_.

 

(a) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone

_Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.01(e)_ and (B) prior to the date
that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Company enters
into any agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to above), then Company shall, on the earlier of the date it enters
into such agreement or the date of consummation of such transaction, pay
Purchaser the Termination Fee, _provided_ , that for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)(ii)_, all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%."

(b) Company and Purchaser each agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Purchaser would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay any
amounts due under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.02_, Company shall pay interest on
such amounts from the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of
actual payment at the rate of interest equal to the sum of (i) the rate of
interest published from time to time in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern
Edition (or any successor publication thereto), designated therein as the
prime rate on the date such payment was due, plus (ii) 200 basis points,
together with the costs and expenses of Purchaser (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that if Company pays or causes to be paid to Purchaser the
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_, Company (or any
successor in interest of Company) will not have any further obligations or
liabilities to Purchaser with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 7.03. _Effect of Termination_. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _

WHEREAS, the Shareholders, Seller and Buyer are executing this Agreement as
an inducement and condition to Buyer entering into, executing and performing

1\. _Representations and Warranties_. Each Shareholder represents and warrants
to Buyer severally, but not jointly, as follows:

(a) The Shareholder has voting power over the number of shares (" _Shareholder
s Shares_") of the common stock of Seller, par value $5.00 per share ("

have voting power over any shares of Seller Stock.

(b) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of, the Shareholder, enforceable in
accordance with its terms.

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
by the Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in a
violation of, or a default under, or conflict with, any contract, trust,
commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or restriction of any kind
to which the Shareholder is a party or bound or to which the Shareholders
Shares are subject.

 Consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not violate, or require any consent, approval, or notice under, any provision
of any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, rule or regulation applicable to
the Shareholder or the Shareholders Shares.

 

(d) The Shareholders Shares and the certificates representing the
Shareholders Shares are now, and at all times during the term hereof will
be, held by the Shareholder, or by a nominee or custodian for the benefit of
such Shareholder, free and clear of all pledges, liens, security interests,
claims, proxies, voting trusts or agreements, understandings or arrangements
or any other encumbrances whatsoever (any such encumbrance, a " _Lien_ "),
except for (i) any such Liens arising hereunder, and (ii) Liens, if any, which
have been previously disclosed in writing to Buyer and will be satisfied and
released at Closing.

(e) The Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Buyer entered into the
Merger Agreement in reliance upon the Shareholders execution and delivery of
this Agreement. The Shareholder acknowledges that the irrevocable proxy set
forth in Section 4 of this Agreement is granted in consideration of the

(f) No broker, investment banker, financial adviser or other Person is

(g) The Shareholder represents that there are no outstanding or valid proxies
or voting rights given to any Person in connection with Shareholders Shares.

2\. _Voting Agreements_. The Shareholder agrees with, and covenants to,
Buyer as follows:

(a) At any meeting of shareholders of Seller called to vote upon the Merger
Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions, and at any adjournment or
postponement thereof, or in any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent
or other approval with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
Transactions is sought (collectively, the " _Shareholders  Meeting_"), the
Shareholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) all of the Shareholders Shares
in favor of the approval of the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and
each of the Transactions, and shall not grant any proxies to any third party,
except where such proxies are expressly directed to vote in favor of the
Merger Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions. The Shareholder hereby
waives all notice and publication of notice of any Shareholders Meeting to
be called or held with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
Transactions.



 



\- 2 - (b) At any Shareholders Meeting or in any other circumstances upon
which their vote, consent or other approval is sought, the Shareholder shall
vote (or cause to be voted) such Shareholders Shares against (i) any
acquisition proposal, including, without limitation, any merger or exchange
agreement or merger or exchange (other than the Merger Agreement, the Merger
and the Transactions), consolidation, combination, sale of substantial assets,
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or
by Seller; (ii) any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
Seller contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this
Agreement; and (iii) any amendment of Sellers articles of incorporation or
bylaws or other proposal or transaction involving Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, which amendment or other proposal or transaction would in any
manner delay, impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify the Merger Agreement, or
any of the Transactions, other than an amendment or other proposal or
transaction required by a regulatory authority or other Governmental Authority
(each of the foregoing in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, a " _Competing
Transaction_ ").

Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to
rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a
shareholder of Seller, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

3\. _Covenants_. The Shareholder agrees with, and covenants to, Buyer as
follows:

 

(a) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, the Shareholder shall not (i)
" _Transfer_ " (which term shall include, without limitation, for the
purposes of this Agreement, any sale, gift, pledge, transfer, hypothecation or
other disposition), or consent to any Transfer of, any or all of the
Shareholders Shares or any interest therein, (ii) enter into any contract,
option or other agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any
Transfer of any or all of Shareholders Shares or any interest therein, (iii)
grant or solicit any proxy, power of attorney or other authorization in or
with respect to Shareholders Shares, except for this Agreement, (iv) deposit
Shareholders Shares into a voting trust or enter into any voting agreement,
arrangement or understanding with respect to Shareholders Shares for any
purpose (other than to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement), or (v)
initiate a shareholders vote or action by consent of Sellers shareholders
with respect to a Competing Transaction; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not preclude a Transfer in connection with bona fide estate
planning purposes to the Shareholders affiliates or immediate family members,
provided that as a condition to such Transfer, such affiliate or immediate
family member shall execute an agreement that is identical to this Agreement
(except to reflect the change in the ownership of the Shareholders Shares)
and provided further, that the assigning Shareholder shall remain jointly
and severally liable for any breaches by any of his or her affiliates or
immediate family members of the terms hereof. The restriction on the Transfer
of the Shareholders Shares set forth in this Section 3(a) shall terminate
upon the first to occur of (x) the Effective Time of the Merger and the
Transactions or (y) the date upon which the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

 

(b) The Shareholder hereby waives any rights of appraisal, or rights to
dissent from the Merger or the Transactions that such Shareholder may have.

 



\- 3 - (c) The Shareholder shall not, nor shall it permit any investment
banker, attorney or other adviser or representative of the Shareholder to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly induce or encourage,
or knowingly take an action to facilitate the making of the submission of any
Competing Transaction, or (ii) except as provided in the Merger Agreement,
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Transactions, other than the
Merger or the Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 

4\. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 4, by
execution of this Agreement, Shareholder does hereby appoint Buyer with the
full power of substitution and resubstitution, as Shareholders true and
lawful attorney and irrevocable proxy, to the full extent of Shareholders
rights with respect to Shareholders Shares, to vote each of such Shareholder
Shares that Shareholder shall be entitled to so vote with respect to the
matters set forth in Section 2 hereof at any Shareholders Meeting, and at any
adjournment or postponement thereof, and in connection with any action of the
shareholders of Seller taken by written consent. Shareholder intends this
proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest hereafter until the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 9 hereof and
hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by Shareholder with respect to the
Shareholder Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
this irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate upon the termination of
this Agreement.

5\. _Certain Events_. The Shareholder agrees that this Agreement and the
obligations hereunder shall attach to the Shareholders Shares and shall be
binding upon any person or entity to which legal or beneficial ownership of
Shareholders Shares shall pass, whether by operation of law or otherwise,
including the Shareholders successors or assigns. In the event of any stock
split, stock dividend, merger, exchange, reorganization, recapitalization or
other change in the capital structure of the Seller affecting the Seller
Common Stock, or the acquisition of additional shares of Seller Stock or
other voting securities of Seller by Shareholder, the number of shares of
Seller Stock subject to the terms of this Agreement shall be adjusted
appropriately and this Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall attach to
any additional shares of Seller Stock or other voting securities of the
Seller issued to or acquired by the Shareholder.

6\. _Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys  Fees_. Shareholder
acknowledges that it is a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into
the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement and
that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Buyer if
Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and
that, in the event of any such failure, irreparable damage will occur and
Buyer will not have any adequate remedy at law. It is accordingly agreed that
Buyer shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive or other
equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or to prevent any breach and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Seller agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of such relief on
the basis that Buyer has an adequate remedy at law. In addition, any third
party participating with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance
in violation of this Agreement and of the rights of Buyer hereunder, and

 



\- 4 -  any such participation by such third party with Shareholder in activities in
violation of the Shareholders agreement with Buyer set forth in this
Agreement may give rise to claims by Buyer against such third party and Buyer
acknowledges that Shareholder may be responsible for any associated
liabilities caused by such third party. In any legal action or other
proceeding relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or if the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement
is brought against either Party, the prevailing Party in such action or
proceeding shall be entitled to recover all reasonable expenses relating
thereto (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, court costs and
expenses incident to arbitration, appellate and post-judgment proceedings)

THIS RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered

WHEREAS, Director is in possession of trade secrets and valuable confidential

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement contemplates that, upon the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement by Seller, as a condition and inducement to

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and
valuable consideration, including, without limitation, the
Merger Consideration to be received by Director and/or the Directors
Affiliate, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, covenant and agree as follows:

 

 1\. _Certain Definitions_.

 

(a) " _Affiliated Company_ " means any company or entity controlled by,
controlling or under common control with Buyer or Seller. 

(b) " _Confidential Information_ " means all information regarding Seller,
Buyer, SNB and their respective Affiliated Companies and any of their
respective activities, businesses or customers that is not generally known to
persons not employed by Seller, Buyer, SNB or their respective Affiliated
Companies, and that is not generally disclosed publicly to persons
not employed by Seller, Buyer, SNB or their respective Affiliated Companies
(except to applicable regulatory authorities and/or pursuant to confidential
or other relationships where there is no expectation of public disclosure or
use by third Persons). " _Confidential Information_ " shall include, without
limitation, all customer information, customer lists, confidential methods of
operation, lending and credit information, commissions, mark-ups,
product/service formulas, information concerning techniques for use and
integration of websites and other products/services, current and future
development and expansion or contraction plans of Seller, Buyer, SNB or their
respective Affiliated Companies, sale/acquisition plans and contacts,
marketing plans and contacts, information concerning the legal affairs of and
information concerning the pricing of products and services,
strategy, tactics and financial affairs of Seller, Buyer, SNB or their
respective Affiliated Companies. " _Confidential Information_ " also includes
any "confidential information," "trade secrets" or any equivalent term
under any applicable federal, state or local law. " _Confidential
Information_ " shall not include information that (i) has become generally
available to the public by the act of one who has the right to disclose such
information without violating any right or privilege of Seller, Buyer or SNB
or their respective Affiliated Companies or any duty owed to any of them; or
(ii) is independently developed by a person or entity without reference to or
use of Confidential Information. Director acknowledges and agrees that the
trading in Buyer or Seller securities using Confidential Information or other
non-public information may violate federal and state securities laws.

 

(c) Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meanings
provided in the Merger Agreement.

 

2\. _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) _Nondisclosure of Confidential Information._ From the Effective Time and
for a period of three (3) years thereafter, Director shall not directly or
indirectly transmit or disclose any Confidential Information to any Person, or
use or permit others to use any such Confidential Information, directly or
indirectly, for any purpose for so long as such information
remains Confidential Information, without the prior express written consent
of the Chief Executive Officer of Buyer, which consent may be withheld in the
sole discretion of Buyers Chief Executive Officer. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, Director shall not be restricted from disclosing
information that is required to be disclosed by law, court order or other
valid and appropriate legal process; _provided, however_ , that in the event
such disclosure is required by law, Director shall (i) if allowed by law or
legal process, provide Buyer with prompt notice of such requirement so that
Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order prior to any such required
disclosure by Director; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain at

 



\- 2 -  Buyers expense assurances that any Confidential Information disclosed will
be accorded confidential treatment; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such
notice or efforts shall be required in connection with any routine audit or
investigation by any Governmental Authority or taxing authority that does not
expressly reference Seller, Buyer, SNB or any of their respective Affiliated
Companies. If, in the absence of a required waiver or protective order,
Director is nonetheless, in the good faith written opinion of Directors legal
counsel, required to disclose Confidential Information, disclosure may be made
only as to that portion of the Confidential Information that counsel advises
Director is required to be disclosed.

(b) _Nonrecruitment of Employees_. Director hereby agrees that, for three (3)
years following the Effective Time, Director shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Buyers Chief Executive Officer, which consent may be
withheld at the sole discretion of the Buyers Chief Executive
Officer, directly or indirectly solicit or recruit or attempt to solicit or
recruit for employment or encourage to leave employment with Buyer or any of
its Affiliated Companies, on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any other
Person, (i) any then-current employee of Buyer or any of its Affiliated
Companies or (ii) any employee of Seller who worked at Seller or any of its
Affiliated Companies during Directors services as a director of Seller or any
Seller Affiliated Company and who has not ceased employment for a minimum of
a six month period with Buyer, Seller or any Affiliated Companies, as
applicable. It is acknowledged that general advertisements shall not be deemed
to violate this provision.

 

(c) _Nonsolicitation of Customers_. Director hereby agrees that, for three (3)
years following the Effective Time, Director shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Buyers Chief Executive Officer, which consent may be
withheld at the sole discretion of Buyers Chief Executive Officer, directly
or indirectly, on behalf of himself, herself or of anyone other than Seller,
Buyer, SNB or any Affiliated Company, in the Restricted Area (as defined in
Section 2(d) below), solicit or attempt to solicit any customer or client of
Seller for the purpose of either (i) providing any Business Activities (as
defined in Section 2(d)) or (ii) inducing such customer or client to cease,
reduce, restrict or divert its business with Seller, Buyer, SNB or any
Affiliated Company. It is acknowledged that general advertisements shall
not be deemed to violate this provision.

(d) _Noncompetition_. Director hereby agrees that, for three (3) years
following the Effective Time, Director shall not, without the prior written
consent of Buyers Chief Executive Officer, which consent may be withheld at
the sole discretion of Buyers Chief Executive Officer, prepare or apply to
commence, or engage or participate in, Business Activities with, for or on
behalf of any other (i) financial institution as an officer, director,
manager, owner, partner, joint venture, consultant, independent contractor,
employee, or shareholder of, or (ii) Person, business or enterprise, in
either case that competes in the Restricted Area with the Buyer, SNB and their
Affiliated Companies with respect to Business Activities. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Business Activities_ " shall be any business activities
conducted by Buyer, Seller, SNB or any of their Affiliated Companies, which
consist of commercial or consumer loans and extensions of credit, letters of
credit, commercial and consumer deposits and deposit accounts, securities
repurchase agreements and sweep accounts, cash management services, money
transfer and bill payment services, internet or electronic banking, automated
teller machines, IRA and retirement accounts, commercial or consumer mortgage
loans, and commercial or consumer

 



\- 3 -  home equity lines of credit. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 2(d) shall prohibit a Director from providing to any entity which
engages in Business Activities within the Restricted Area (i) services that
the Director provides as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) services that
the Director has provided prior to the date of this Agreement as a part of
such Directors current business. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Restricted Area_ " shall mean each county in Florida where the Bank operates
a banking office at the Effective Time and each county contiguous to each of
such counties. Nothing in this Section 2(d) shall prohibit Director from
acquiring or holding, for investment purposes only, less than five percent
(5%) of the outstanding securities of any company or business organization
which may compete directly or indirectly with Seller, Buyer, SNB or any
of their Affiliated Companies. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit a
Director or any of such Directors Affiliated Companies from continuing to
hold outstanding securities, or purchase additional securities, of an entity
that engages in Business Activities; provided that such securities were held
by the Director or any of such Directors Affiliated Company as of the date of
this Agreement or represent additional securities purchased by the Director in
the same entity following the date of this Agreement. If Buyer is sold during
the term of the Agreement, the terms under Section 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d) hereof
shall be automatically reduced to the lesser of (x) three (3) to two (2) years
or (y) the remainder of the Term hereunder.

(e) _Enforceability of Covenants._ Director acknowledges and agrees that the
covenants in this Agreement are direct consideration for a sale of a business
and should be governed by standards applicable to restrictive covenants
entered into in connection with a sale of a business. Director acknowledges
that each of Buyer, SNB and its Affiliated Companies have a current and
future expectation of business within the Restricted Area and from the current
and proposed customers of Seller that are derived from the acquisition of
Seller by Buyer. Director acknowledges that the term, geographic area, and
scope of the covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable, and agrees
that he will not, in any action, suit or other proceeding, deny the
reasonableness of, or assert the unreasonableness of, the premises,
consideration or scope of the covenants set forth herein. Director agrees
that his position as a director of Seller involves duties and authority
relating to all aspects of the Business Activities and all of the Restricted
Area. Director further acknowledges that complying with the provisions
contained in this Agreement will not preclude him from engaging in a lawful
profession, trade or business, or from becoming gainfully employed. Director
and Buyer agree that Directors obligations under the above covenants are
separate and distinct under this Agreement, and the failure or alleged failure
of the Buyer to perform its obligations under any other provisions of this
Agreement shall not constitute a defense to the enforceability of this
covenant. Director and Buyer agree that if any portion of the foregoing
provisions is deemed to be unenforceable because the geography, time or scope
of activities restricted is deemed to be too broad, the court shall be
authorized to substitute for the overbroad term an enforceable term that will
enable the enforcement of the covenants to the maximum extent possible under
applicable law. Director acknowledges and agrees that any breach or threatened
breach of this covenant will result in irreparable damage and injury to the
Buyer, SNB and their Affiliated Companies and that damages arising out of such
breach would be difficult to ascertain. Director hereby agrees that, in
addition to all other remedies provided at law or in equity, Buyer will be
entitled to exercise all rights including, without limitation, obtaining one
or more temporary restraining orders, injunctive relief and other equitable
relief, including specific performance in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement, without the necessity of posting any
bond or security (all of which are waived by the Director), and to exercise
all other rights or remedies, at law or in equity, including, without
limitation, the rights to damages.

 



\- 4 - 3\. _Successors_.

 

(a) This Agreement is personal to Director, is not assignable by Director, and
none of Directors duties hereunder may be delegated.

 

(b) This Agreement may be assigned by, and shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Buyer, SNB and any of their Affiliated Companies and their
successors and assigns.

4\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or
discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in
writing signed by Director and Buyer. No waiver by either party hereto at any
time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any
condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party
shall be deemed a waiver of dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same
or any prior subsequent time.

(a) _Severability_. If any provision or covenant, or any part thereof, of
this Agreement should be held by any court to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, either in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of
the remaining provisions or covenants, or any part thereof, of this Agreement,
all of which shall remain in full force and effect.

 

(b) _Attorneys  Fees_. In any legal action or other proceeding relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or if the enforcement
of any right or benefit provided by this Agreement is brought against a Party,

which an arbitral panel, court or other Governmental Authority issues a final
order, judgment, decree or award granting substantially the relief sought
shall be entitled upon demand to be paid by the other Party, all reasonable
costs incurred in connection with such legal action or other proceeding,
including the reasonable legal fees and charges of counsel, court costs and
expenses incident to arbitration, appellate and post-judgment proceedings,
provided no party shall be entitled to any punitive or exemplary damages,
which are hereby waived.

 

(d) _Governing Law and Forum Selection_. Buyer and Director agree that this
Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance
with the laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to its conflicts
of law principles. Director agrees that any action to enforce this Agreement,
as well as any action relating to or arising out of this Agreement, shall
be filed only in the state courts of Orange County, Florida. With respect to
any such court action, Director hereby (i) irrevocably submits to the personal
jurisdiction of such courts; (ii) consents to service of process; (iii)
consents to venue; and (iv) waives any other

 



\- 5 -  requirement (whether imposed by statute, rule of court, or otherwise) with
respect to personal jurisdiction, service of process, or venue. Both parties
hereto further agree that the state courts of Orange County, Florida are
convenient forums for any dispute that may arise herefrom and that neither
party shall raise as a defense that such courts are not convenient forums.

 

(e) _Notices_. All notice, consent, demand, request or other communication
given to a party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been given such party (i) when delivered
personally to such party or (ii) provided that a written acknowledgement of

FORM OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT

 

[FORM OF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AGREEMENT]

 

THIS RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of June 11, 2018, by and between Seacoast Banking Corporation of
Florida, a Florida corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and the undersigned executive
officer (" _Employee_ ") of First Green Bancorp, Inc., a Florida corporation
(" _First Green_ ") and/or First Green Bank, a Florida commercial bank and
wholly owned subsidiary of First Green (the " _Bank_ " and collectively with
First Green, " _Seller_ ") and shall become effective as of the Effective Time
of the Merger as provided in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

WHEREAS, Buyer, Seacoast National Bank, a national banking association
and wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _SNB_ "), First Green and the Bank
are parties to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 11,
2018, as the same may be amended or supplemented (the " _Merger Agreement_
"), that provides for, among other things, the merger of First Green with and
into Buyer (the " _Merger_ "), and the subsequent merger of the Bank with and
into SNB (the " _Bank Merger_ ");

 

WHEREAS, Employee is a shareholder and/or officer of Seller;

 

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger and pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Employee and/or an Affiliate
of Employee is selling shares of First Green Common Stock held by Employee
and/or the Employees Affiliate to Buyer and will receive Merger Consideration
in exchange for such shares;

 

WHEREAS, Employee is in possession of trade secrets and valuable confidential
business information of Seller, and has substantial relationships with its
banking customers;

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, Employee has served as a manager of Seller,
and, therefore, Employee has knowledge of the Confidential Information
(hereinafter defined);

WHEREAS, the Employee acknowledges that the Buyer has legitimate business
interests to justify the enforcement of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger and the Bank Merger, Buyer will succeed to
all of the Confidential Information, for which Buyer, as of the Effective
Time, will have paid valuable consideration and desires reasonable protection;
and

 

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement contemplates that, upon the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement by Seller, as a condition and inducement to
the willingness of Buyer and SNB to enter into the Merger Agreement, Employee
will enter into and perform this Agreement.

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and
valuable consideration, including, without limitation, the
Merger Consideration to be received by Employee and/or the Employees
Affiliate, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, covenant and agree as follows:

 

 1\. _Certain Definitions_.

 

(a) " _Affiliated Company_ " means any company or entity controlled by,
controlling or under common control with Buyer or Seller. 

(b) " _Confidential Information_ " means all information regarding Seller,
Buyer, SNB and their respective Affiliated Companies and any of their
respective activities, businesses or customers that is not generally known to
persons not employed by Seller, Buyer, SNB or their respective Affiliated
Companies, and that is not generally disclosed publicly to persons
not employed by Seller, Buyer, SNB or their respective Affiliated Companies
(except to applicable regulatory authorities and/or pursuant to confidential
or other relationships where there is no expectation of public disclosure or
use by third Persons). " _Confidential Information_ " shall include, without
limitation, all customer information, customer lists, confidential methods of
operation, lending and credit information, commissions, mark-ups,
product/service formulas, information concerning techniques for use and
integration of websites and other products/services, current and future
development and expansion or contraction plans of Seller, Buyer, SNB or their
respective Affiliated Companies, sale/acquisition plans and contacts,
marketing plans and contacts, information concerning the legal affairs of and
information concerning the pricing of products and services,
strategy, tactics and financial affairs of Seller, Buyer, SNB or their
respective Affiliated Companies. " _Confidential Information_ " also includes
any "confidential information," "trade secrets" or any equivalent term
under any applicable federal, state or local law. " _Confidential
Information_ " shall not include information that (i) has become generally
available to the public by the act of one who has the right to disclose such
information without violating any right or privilege of Seller, Buyer or SNB
or their respective Affiliated Companies or any duty owed to any of them; or
(ii) is independently developed by a person or entity without reference to or
use of Confidential Information. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the
trading in Buyer or Seller securities using Confidential Information or other
non-public information may violate federal and state securities laws.

 

(c) Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meanings
provided in the Merger Agreement.

 

2\. _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) _Nondisclosure of Confidential Information._ From the Effective Time and
for a period of five (5) years thereafter, Employee shall not directly or
indirectly transmit or disclose any Confidential Information to any Person, or
use or permit others to use any such Confidential Information, directly or
indirectly, for any purpose for so long as such information
remains Confidential Information, without the prior express written consent
of the Chief Executive Officer of Buyer, which consent may be withheld in the
sole discretion of Buyers Chief Executive Officer. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, Employee shall not be restricted from disclosing
information that is required to be disclosed by law, court order or other
valid and appropriate legal process; _provided, however_ , that in the event
such disclosure is required by law, Employee shall (i) if allowed by law or
legal process, provide Buyer with prompt notice of such requirement so that
Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order prior to any such required
disclosure by Employee; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to

 



\- 2 -  obtain assurances that any Confidential Information disclosed will be
accorded confidential treatment; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such notice
or efforts shall be required in connection with any routine audit or
investigation by any Governmental Authority or taxing authority that does not
expressly reference Seller, Buyer, SNB or any of their respective Affiliated
Companies. If, in the absence of a required waiver or protective order,
Employee is nonetheless, in the good faith written opinion of his legal
counsel, required to disclose Confidential Information, disclosure may be made
only as to that portion of the Confidential Information that counsel
advises Employee is required to be disclosed.

(b) _Nonrecruitment of Employees_. Employee hereby agrees that, for two (2)
years following the Effective Time, Employee shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Buyers Chief Executive Officer, which consent may be
withheld at the sole discretion of the Buyers Chief Executive Officer,
directly or indirectly solicit or recruit or attempt to solicit or recruit
for employment or encourage to leave employment with Buyer or any of its
Affiliated Companies, on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any other
Person, (i) any then-current employee of Buyer or any of its Affiliated
Companies or (ii) any employee of Seller who worked at Seller or any of its
Affiliated Companies during Employees services as a manager of Seller or any
Seller Affiliated Company and who has not ceased employment for a minimum of
a six month period with Buyer, Seller or any Affiliated Companies, as
applicable. It is acknowledged that general advertisements shall not be deemed
to violate this provision.

 

(c) _Nonsolicitation of Customers_. Employee hereby agrees that, for two (2)
years following the Effective Time, Employee shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Buyers Chief Executive Officer, which consent may be
withheld at the sole discretion of Buyers Chief Executive Officer, directly
or indirectly, on behalf of himself, herself or of anyone other than Seller,
Buyer, SNB or any Affiliated Company, in the Restricted Area (as defined in
Section 2(d) below), solicit or attempt to solicit any customer or client of
Seller for the purpose of either (i) providing any Business Activities (as
defined in Section 2(d)) or (ii) inducing such customer or client to cease,
reduce, restrict or divert its business with Seller, Buyer, SNB or any
Affiliated Company. It is acknowledged that general advertisements shall not
be deemed to violate this provision.

(d) _Noncompetition_. Employee hereby agrees that, for two (2) years following
the Effective Time, Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of
Buyers Chief Executive Officer, which consent may be withheld at the sole
discretion of Buyers Chief Executive Officer, prepare or apply to commence,
or engage or participate in, Business Activities with, for or on behalf of
any other (i) financial institution as an officer, director, manager, owner,
partner, joint venture, consultant, independent contractor, employee, or
shareholder of, or (ii) Person, business or enterprise, in either case that
competes in the Restricted Area with the Buyer, SNB and their Affiliated
Companies with respect to Business Activities. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Business Activities_ " shall be any business activities conducted by
Buyer, Seller, SNB or any of their Affiliated Companies, which consist of
commercial or consumer loans and extensions of credit, letters of credit,
commercial and consumer deposits and deposit accounts, securities
repurchase agreements and sweep accounts, cash management services, money
transfer and bill payment services, internet or electronic banking, automated
teller machines, IRA and retirement accounts, commercial or consumer mortgage
loans, and commercial or consumer

 



\- 3 -  home equity lines of credit. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 2(d) shall prohibit an Employee from providing to any entity which
engages in Business Activities within the Restricted Area (i) services that
the Employee provides as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) services that
the Employee has provided prior to the date of this Agreement as a part of
such Employees current business. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Restricted Area_ " shall mean Brevard, Broward, DeSoto, Glades, Hendry,
Highlands, Hillsborough, Indian River, Lake, Manatee, Martin, Okeechobee,
Orange, Palm Beach, Pinellas, Polk, Seminole, St. Lucie and Volusia counties
in Florida. Nothing in this Section 2(d) shall prohibit Employee from
acquiring or holding, for investment purposes only, less than five percent
(5%) of the outstanding securities of any company or business organization
which may compete directly or indirectly with Seller, Buyer, SNB or any of
their Affiliated Companies. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Employee
or any of such Employees Affiliated Companies from continuing to hold
outstanding securities of an entity that engages in Business Activities;
provided that, such securities were held by the Employee or any of such
Employees Affiliated Company as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(e) _Enforceability of Covenants._ Employee acknowledges and agrees that the
covenants in this Agreement are direct consideration for a sale of a business
and should be governed by standards applicable to restrictive covenants
entered into in connection with a sale of a business. Employee acknowledges
that each of Buyer, SNB and its Affiliated Companies have a current and
future expectation of business within the Restricted Area and from the
current and proposed customers of Seller that are derived from the acquisition
of Seller by Buyer. Employee acknowledges that the term, geographic area, and
scope of the covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable, and agrees
that he will not, in any action, suit or other proceeding, deny the
reasonableness of, or assert the unreasonableness of, the premises,
consideration or scope of the covenants set forth herein. Employee agrees
that his position as an Employee of First Green and Bank involves duties and
authority relating to all aspects of the Business Activities and all of the
Restricted Area. Employee further acknowledges that complying with
the provisions contained in this Agreement will not preclude him from
engaging in a lawful profession, trade or business, or from becoming gainfully
employed. Employee and Buyer agree that Employees obligations under the above
covenants are separate and distinct under this Agreement, and the failure or
alleged failure of the Buyer to perform its obligations under any other
provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a defense to the
enforceability of this covenant. Employee and Buyer agree that if any portion
of the foregoing provisions is deemed to be unenforceable because the
geography, time or scope of activities restricted is deemed to be too broad,
the court shall be authorized to substitute for the overbroad term
an enforceable term that will enable the enforcement of the covenants to the
maximum extent possible under applicable law. Employee acknowledges and agrees
that any breach or threatened breach of this covenant will result in
irreparable damage and injury to the Buyer, SNB and their Affiliated
Companies and that damages arising out of such breach would be difficult to
ascertain. Employee hereby agrees that, in addition to all other remedies
provided at law or in equity, Buyer will be entitled to exercise all rights
including, without limitation, obtaining one or more temporary restraining
orders, injunctive relief and other equitable relief, including specific
performance in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement, without the necessity of posting any bond or security (all of
which are waived by the Employee), and to exercise all other rights or
remedies, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the rights to
damages.

 



\- 4 - 3\. _Successors_.

 

(a) This Agreement is personal to Employee, is not assignable by Employee, and
none of Employees duties hereunder may be delegated.

 

(b) This Agreement may be assigned by, and shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Buyer, SNB and any of their Affiliated Companies and their
successors and assigns.

4\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or
discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in
writing signed by Employee and Buyer. No waiver by either party hereto at any
time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any
condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party
shall be deemed a waiver of dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same
or any prior subsequent time.

(a) _Severability_. If any provision or covenant, or any part thereof, of
this Agreement should be held by any court to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, either in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of
the remaining provisions or covenants, or any part thereof, of this Agreement,
all of which shall remain in full force and effect.

 

(b) _Attorneys  Fees_. In any legal action or other proceeding relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or if the enforcement
of any right or benefit provided by this Agreement is brought against a Party,
the prevailing Party in any such legal action or other proceeding pursuant to
which an arbitral panel, court or other Governmental Authority issues a final
order, judgment, decree or award granting substantially the relief sought
shall be entitled upon demand to be paid by the other Party, all reasonable
costs incurred in connection with such legal action or other proceeding,
including the reasonable legal fees and charges of counsel, court costs and
expenses incident to arbitration, appellate and post-judgment proceedings,
provided no party shall be entitled to any punitive or exemplary damages,
which are hereby waived.

 

(d) _Governing Law and Forum Selection_. Buyer and Employee agree that this
Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance
with the laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to its conflicts
of law principles. Employee agrees that any action to enforce this Agreement,
as well as any action relating to or arising out of this Agreement, shall
be filed only in the state courts of Orange County, Florida. With respect to
any such court action, Employee hereby (i) irrevocably submits to the personal
jurisdiction of such courts; (ii) consents to service of process; (iii)
consents to venue; and (iv) waives any other requirement (whether imposed by
statute, rule of court, or otherwise) with respect to personal

 



\- 5 -  jurisdiction, service of process, or venue. Both parties hereto further
agree that the state courts of Orange County, Florida are convenient forums
for any dispute that may arise herefrom and that neither party shall raise as
a defense that such courts are not convenient forums.

Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida

815 Colorado Avenue

Stuart, Florida 34994

 

Attention: Dennis S. Hudson, III

Gentlemen:

 

This claims letter (" _Claims Letter_ ") is delivered pursuant to Section 5.18
of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 11, 2018 (as
the same may be amended or supplemented, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and
among Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida, a Florida corporation ("
_Buyer_ "), Seacoast National Bank, a national banking association and wholly
owned subsidiary of Buyer, First Green Bancorp, Inc., a Florida corporation ("
_Seller_ ") and First Green Bank, a Florida commercial bank and wholly owned
subsidiary of Seller. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

Concerning claims which the undersigned may have against Seller or Buyer or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in all capacities, whether as an officer,
director, employee, partner, controlling person or Affiliate or otherwise of
Seller, First Green Bank or any Seller entity, and in consideration of the
premises, and the mutual covenants contained herein and in the Merger
