Restricted Area (i)&nbsp;services that the Director provides as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;services that the Director has provided prior to the date of this Agreement as a part of such Director&#146;s current business. For purposes
of this Agreement, the &#147;<U>Restricted Area</U>&#148; shall mean each county in Florida where the Bank operates a banking office at the Effective Time and each county contiguous to each of such counties. Nothing in this Section&nbsp;2(d) shall
prohibit Director from acquiring or holding, for investment purposes only, less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding securities of any company or business organization which may compete directly or indirectly with Seller, Buyer, SNB or any of
their Affiliated Companies. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit a Director or any of such Director&#146;s Affiliated Companies from continuing to hold outstanding securities, or purchase additional securities, of an entity that engages in
Business Activities; provided that such securities were held by the Director or any of such Director&#146;s Affiliated Company as of the date of this Agreement or represent additional securities purchased by the Director in the same entity following
the date of this Agreement. If Buyer is sold during the term of the Agreement, the terms under Section&nbsp;2(b), 2(c), and 2(d) hereof shall be automatically reduced to the lesser of (x)&nbsp;three (3) to two (2)&nbsp;years or (y)&nbsp;the

Agreement are direct consideration for a sale of a business and should be governed by standards applicable to restrictive covenants entered into in connection with a sale of a business. Director acknowledges that each of Buyer, SNB and its
Affiliated Companies have a current and future expectation of business within the Restricted Area and from the current and proposed customers of Seller that are derived from the acquisition of Seller by Buyer. Director acknowledges that the term,
geographic area, and scope of the covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable, and agrees that he will not, in any action, suit or other proceeding, deny the reasonableness of, or assert the unreasonableness of, the premises, consideration
or scope of the covenants set forth herein. Director agrees that his position as a director of Seller involves duties and authority relating to all aspects of the Business Activities and all of the Restricted Area. Director further acknowledges that
complying with the provisions contained in this Agreement will not preclude him from engaging in a lawful profession, trade or business, or from becoming gainfully employed. Director and Buyer agree that Director&#146;s obligations under the above
covenants are separate and distinct under this Agreement, and the failure or alleged failure of the Buyer to perform its obligations under any other provisions of this Agreement shall not constitute a defense to the enforceability of this covenant.
Director and Buyer agree that if any portion of the foregoing provisions is deemed to be unenforceable because the geography, time or scope of activities restricted is deemed to be too broad, the court shall be authorized to substitute for the
overbroad term an enforceable term that will enable the enforcement of the covenants to the maximum extent possible under applicable law. Director acknowledges and agrees that any breach or threatened breach of this covenant will result in
irreparable damage and injury to the Buyer, SNB and their Affiliated Companies and that damages arising out of such breach would be difficult to ascertain. Director hereby agrees that, in addition to all other remedies provided at law or in equity,
Buyer will be entitled to exercise all rights including, without limitation, obtaining one or more temporary restraining orders, injunctive relief and other equitable relief, including specific performance in the event of any breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement, without the necessity of posting any bond or security (all of which are waived by the Director), and to exercise all other rights or remedies, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the rights to damages. </P>

sale of a business and should be governed by standards applicable to restrictive covenants entered into in connection with a sale of a business. Employee acknowledges that each of Buyer, SNB and its Affiliated Companies have a current and future
expectation of business within the Restricted Area and from the current and proposed customers of Seller that are derived from the acquisition of Seller by Buyer. Employee acknowledges that the term, geographic area, and scope of the covenants set
forth in this Agreement are reasonable, and agrees that he will not, in any action, suit or other proceeding, deny the reasonableness of, or assert the unreasonableness of, the premises, consideration or scope of the covenants set forth herein.
Employee agrees that his position as an Employee of First Green and Bank involves duties and authority relating to all aspects of the Business Activities and all of the Restricted Area. Employee further acknowledges that complying with the
provisions contained in this Agreement will not preclude him from engaging in a lawful profession, trade or business, or from becoming gainfully employed. Employee and Buyer agree that Employee&#146;s obligations under the above covenants are
separate and distinct under this Agreement, and the failure or alleged failure of the Buyer to perform its obligations under any other provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a defense to the enforceability of this covenant. Employee and
Buyer agree that if any portion of the foregoing provisions is deemed to be unenforceable because the geography, time or scope of activities restricted is deemed to be too broad, the court shall be authorized to substitute for the overbroad term an
enforceable term that will enable the enforcement of the covenants to the maximum extent possible under applicable law. Employee acknowledges and agrees that any breach or threatened breach of this covenant will result in irreparable damage and
injury to the Buyer, SNB and their Affiliated Companies and that damages arising out of such breach would be difficult to ascertain. Employee hereby agrees that, in addition to all other remedies provided at law or in equity, Buyer will be entitled
to exercise all rights including, without limitation, obtaining one or more temporary restraining orders, injunctive relief and other equitable relief, including specific performance in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement,
without the necessity of posting any bond or security (all of which are waived by the Employee), and to exercise all other rights or remedies, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the rights to damages. </P>
