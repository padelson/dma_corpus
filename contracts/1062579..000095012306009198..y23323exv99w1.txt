Agreement and each  has the right, power and authority to sell and transfer
its proportion of  the Sellers\' Shares in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement.  (C) In accordance with Article 10 of the Articles, the Buyer has

Preferred  Shares held by each of them, subject at all times to the
provisions of  Article 10.4 of the Articles.  (D) The Sellers have agreed

The agreement so made by Broadview and Kennet in respect of  their Preferred

any person to  whom it is made, the parties intend that any issued shares in
the Company  be compulsorily acquired by the Buyer in accordance with the

either:   (a) the Buyer having received unconditional confirmation from the
German  Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) that the acquisition of
the  entire issued share capital of the Company by the Buyer as 
contemplated by this Agreement does not meet the requirements for the 
prohibition of a concentration pursuant to Sections 35 et seq. of GWB 
(Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschrankungen; German Act against Restraints  of
Competition); or   (b) the applicable waiting periods under Section 40 of
GWB having expired  without the German Federal Cartel Office having
prohibited such  acquisition prior to the expiry of those waiting periods
(the "Buyer  Condition").  2.2 The Buyer shall, at its own cost, procure
that the Submission Letter is  sent to the German Federal Cartel Office no
later than 1 Business Day after  the date of this Agreement, and shall use
all reasonable endeavours to  ensure that the Buyer Condition is fulfilled as
soon as reasonably  practicable after the date of this Agreement. The Buyer
shall have primary  responsibility for obtaining all consents, approvals or
actions of any  Governmental Entity which are required in order to satisfy
the Buyer  Condition and shall take all reasonable steps to obtain the same
for that  purpose (including promptly making all appropriate submissions, 
notifications and filings, in consultation with the Sellers\' 
Representatives). The Buyer shall for this purpose:   (a) provide promptly
all information which is requested or required by any  such Governmental
Entity;   (b) promptly notify the Sellers\' Representatives (and provide
copies or,  in the case of non written communications, details) of any 
communications with any such Governmental Entity relating to any such 
consent, approval or action;   (c) communicate with any such Governmental
Entity in writing only after  prior consultation with the Sellers\'
Representatives or their advisers  (and paying due consideration to any
reasonable comments and requests  of the Sellers\' Representatives and their
advisers) and provide the  Sellers\' Representatives (or their advisers) with
copies of all such  submissions, notifications, filings and other
communications in the  form submitted or sent;   (d) (without limiting (c)
above) provide the Sellers\' Representatives (or  their advisers) with a
final draft of all submissions, notifications,  filings and other

a reasonable opportunity to  provide comments and for the Buyer to pay due
consideration to any  reasonable comments of the Sellers\' Representatives
(or their  advisers) on such drafts prior to their submission;   (e) where
permitted by the Governmental Entity, allow persons nominated by  the
Sellers\' Representatives to attend all meetings (and participate  in all
material telephone or other conversations) with the  Governmental Entity and
to make oral submissions at the meetings (or  in telephone or other
conversations); and   (f) regularly review with the Sellers\'
Representatives the progress of any  notifications or filings (including,
where necessary, seeking to  identify appropriate commitments to address any
anti-trust concerns  identified by any Governmental Entity) and discuss with
the Sellers\'  Representatives the scope, timing and tactics of any such
commitments  with a      view to obtaining clearance from any
Governmental Entity at the  earliest reasonable opportunity.  2.3 The Buyer
shall not make any filing with any Governmental Entity which is  not required
in order to fulfil the Buyer Condition without complying  mutatis mutandis
with the provisions of clause 2.2(d).  2.4 The Sellers\' Representatives and

with such assistance as the Buyer  reasonably requests for the purpose of
fulfilling the Buyer\'s obligations  under clause 2.1 above, including:

requested or required by the Bundeskartellamt or any other  governmental or

and providing copies, of any communications from  the Bundeskartellamt to the
Sellers or the Company or any other  governmental or regulatory body or
persons in relation to obtaining  any such consents, approvals or actions

supplied to the Buyer; and   (c) where permitted by the Bundeskartellamt or
any other governmental or  regulatory body or persons concerned, allowing
persons nominated by  the Buyer to attend all meetings held by the Sellers or
the  Bundeskartellamt or any other governmental or regulatory body or 
persons and, where appropriate, to make oral submissions at such  meeting and
the Sellers\' Representatives shall not request any such  meeting without the
Buyer\'s written consent not to be unreasonably  withheld or delayed.  2.5
The Buyer shall notify the Sellers\' Representatives as soon as it becomes 
aware that the Buyer Condition is satisfied. The first Business Day on or  by
which the Buyer Condition has been fulfilled (or waived in accordance  with
clause 2.6) is the condition satisfaction date (the "Condition  Satisfaction
Date").  2.6 The Buyer may by notice to the Sellers\' Representatives waive
the Buyer  Condition. Any such waiver may relate to the whole or any part of
that  condition.  2.7 If the Condition Satisfaction Date has not occurred
on the date falling 128  days after the date of this Agreement (the "Longstop
Date"), then the  Sellers\' Representatives and the Buyer may agree to extend
the Longstop  Date and, if not so agreed, either the Sellers\'
Representatives or the  Buyer may at their/its sole discretion by notice
served on the other elect  to terminate this Agreement. If in accordance with
this clause 2.7 the  Longstop Date is extended, the provisions of this clause
2.7 shall apply in  respect of the new Longstop Date from time to time
applicable.  2.8 Where the Sellers\' Representatives have terminated this
Agreement in  accordance with clause 2.7, the Buyer shall within three

amount of  L100,000 plus VAT.  2.9 In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with clause  2.7, the parties shall have no further
rights, remedies or obligations  under or in respect of this Agreement,
(other than accrued rights or  obligations at the time of termination
pursuant to clause 2.7) save that  clauses 2.8 and 13 shall remain binding in
accordance with their terms, and  further provided that this clause shall be
without prejudice to:      (a) the Sellers\' rights to bring an action
for damages against the Buyer  where the subject matter of the claim relates
to the Buyer\'s failure  to use all reasonable endeavours to procure
satisfaction of the Buyer  Condition; and   (b) the Buyer\'s rights to
bring an action for damages against the Sellers  where the subject matter of
the claim relates to the Sellers\' failure  to use all reasonable endeavours
to assist the Buyer in satisfying the  Buyer Condition.  3 SALE AND

any holder of  shares in the capital of the Company or options to subscribe
for shares in  the Company that:   (a) he is entitled to more than the sum
offered by the Buyer pursuant to  this Agreement; or the drag-along
provisions contained in Article 7.9  of the Articles or (if then adopted)
Article 7.9 of the New Articles;  or   (b) he is entitled not to sell those
Dragged Shares to the Buyer.   The indemnity and obligations under this
clause 8.8 shall lapse and cease  to have any further effect on and from the
date which is 6 years following  the Final Option Exercise Date.  8.9 If
the Buyer by virtue of the limitations contained in paragraph 2.1 of 
Schedule 6 is prohibited from recovering the entire amount due in respect  of
a Claim (as such term is defined in Schedule 6) Settled in its favour,  each
of the Warrantors shall severally indemnify the Buyer against all  costs and
expenses reasonably incurred by the Buyer or any Group Company in  connection
with such Claim (as such term is defined in Schedule 6) up to  his Relevant
Percentage of such amount, and in any event up to a maximum  aggregate cap of
US$3,000,000.  8.10 If a member of the Buyer\'s Group becomes aware of any
claim or any putative  claim against any Group Company or Buyer\'s Group by
any third party (a  "Share Capital Claim") which does or is reasonably likely
to give rise to  an indemnity payment under clause 8.8 above:   (a) the
Buyer shall as soon as reasonably practicable give written notice  of the
Share Capital Claim to the Sellers\' Representatives and shall  consult with
them in respect of the Share Capital Claim;   (b) the Buyer shall, and shall
procure that each member of the Buyer\'s  Group shall, ensure the
following:   (i) not make any admission of liability, compromise or
settlement of  any Share Capital Claim without the written consent of the 
Sellers\' Representatives;   (ii) at the written request of the Sellers\'
Representatives and at the  cost of the Sellers take such action or (at the
Sellers\'  Representatives\' option) permit the Sellers\' Representatives
to  take such action as the Sellers\' Representatives consider  appropriate
to avoid, dispute, resist, appeal, defend, compromise  or settle the Share
Capital Claim (including, without limitation,  make any counterclaims or
other claims against third parties) and  any related adjudication or
proceedings, and to conduct matters  relating thereto including negotiations
or appeals, subject to  the Buyer and/or the relevant member of the Buyer\'s
Group being  indemnified for all costs and expenses;   (iii) provide to the
Sellers\' Representatives and their advisers  reasonable access during normal
working hours to premises and  personnel and to relevant assets,     
documents and records within each member of the Buyer\'s Group\'s  power or
control for the purposes of investigating the matter  which allegedly gives
rise to the Share Capital Claim and/or  defending the Share Capital Claim
subject to any duties of  confidentiality owed to third parties; and   (iv)
permit the Sellers\' Representatives (at the Sellers\' cost) to  examine and
take copies of the documents or records, and  photograph the premises or
assets, referred to in clause  8.10(b)(iii) above subject to any duties of
confidentiality owed  to third parties; and   (v) from the date when it
first becomes aware of a Share Capital  Claim, the Buyer shall use all
reasonable endeavours to preserve,  and shall ensure that each member of the
Buyer\'s Group shall use  all reasonable endeavours to preserve all
documents, records,  correspondence, accounts, electronically stored data and
other  information whatsoever relevant to a matter to the extent it 
believes that the same may give rise to a Share Capital Claim.   (c) The
Sellers\' Representatives shall provide the Buyer with copies of  all
correspondence and other documents immediately upon receipt or  creation in
relation to any action taken pursuant to clause 8.10.1 and  permit the Buyer
to attend all meetings (including meetings with  professional advisers and
with any other party to a dispute) relating  to any dispute.  8.11 In the
event that the Notified Withholding Amount (which the parties  recognise is
an estimate) is less than the aggregate of the actual amounts  of Tax
liabilities which arise, as are described in sub-paragraph (k)(iv),  (viii)
and (ix) of Paragraph 1.1 of Part 1 of Schedule 3, the Warrantors  shall
severally and proportionately (having the meaning set out in clause  8.2) be
liable to pay to the Buyer a sum equal to the amount (if any) by  which the
Notified Withholding Amount is less than such aggregate of such  actual
amounts of Tax liabilities provided that the indemnification  obligations
under this clause shall be reduced or eliminated to the extent  that such
amount is:   (a) recovered from the relevant Option Holder (and a Group
Company shall  be obliged to use its reasonable endeavours to recover such
sum  provided that no Group Company shall have an obligation to issue legal 
proceedings against any Option Holder) including by making a deduction  from
the relevant Option Holder\'s salary payments (so far as permitted  by law)
in accordance with the Option Holder Instruction Forms; or   (b) provided
for in the Tax Amount and/or employer\'s national insurance  contributions of
up to L603,000 which would otherwise be taken into  account in the Working
Capital Deficit Amount in the absence of the  principle contained in the
definition of Working Capital Deficit  Amount that states that only amounts
in excess of L603,000 should be  included in the Working Capital Deficit
Amount.   If the Notified Withholding Amount is greater than the actual
amount of Tax  liabilities which arise in respect of an Option Holder then
such excess  shall be paid to the relevant Option Holder.   If the
Warrantors make a payment under this clause 8.11 and subsequently it  is
finally agreed or determined that the Notified Withholding Amount and  the
amount paid by the Warrantors under this clause 8.11 is greater than  the
actual amount of Tax liabilities that arise then the excess shall first  be
paid to the Warrantors and the balance (if any) shall be paid to the 
relevant Option Holder and to the extent that such balance is insufficient 
to refund Option Holders in full then such balance shall be repaid to  Option
Holders on a pro rata basis.  8.12 In the event that the actual amount
payable by way of advisory fees and  expenses and irrecoverable VAT thereon
plus payments in lieu of phantom  option/share entitlements and taxation
equalisation payments paid or  incurred by any of the Companies in relation
to this transaction    exceeds the amount of the Transaction Costs listed
in Appendix B, the  Warrantors shall severally be liable to repay to the
Buyer on demand an  amount equal to the excess.  9 LIMITATIONS ON SELLERS\'
LIABILITY   The parties agree that the provisions of Schedule 6 shall apply
in  accordance with their terms.  10 BUYER WARRANTIES   The Buyer
warrants to the Sellers in the terms of Part 3 of Schedule 5, and  each of
the Buyer\'s warranties contained in this Agreement is separate and 
independent and shall not be limited by reference to any other 
representation or warranty or to any other provision of this Agreement.  11
GUARANTEES AND INDEBTEDNESS   Any loss incurred by the Buyer or any of the
Group Companies as a direct  result of a breach of the Warranty contained in
paragraph 6 of Part 1 of  Schedule 5 shall be reimbursed by the relevant
liable Sellers to the Buyer  on a pound for pound basis. Each Seller hereby
irrevocably and  unconditionally waives any claim he may have against any
Group Company on  Completion, actual or contingent, save in the case of any
of the Executives  and the Management Shareholders, to the extent comprising
a claim for  accrued salary or unpaid expenses or other similar contractual
benefits.  12 WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT  12.1 The Buyer shall use all
reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Completion  Accounts are prepared
and delivered to the Executives and the Institutions  as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within 60 days) after  Completion. The
Completion Accounts shall be prepared in accordance with  the accounting
policies, bases and practices used in the Accounts. The  parties acknowledge
that the Accounts have been prepared in accordance with  UK GAAP.  12.2 The
Buyer shall deliver to the Executives and the Institutions, together  with
Completion Accounts prepared and delivered pursuant to clause 12.1, a 
calculation in US$ of the Net Cash.  12.3 Each calculation delivered
pursuant to clause 12.2 shall be deemed agreed  by the Executives and the
Institutions on the date falling 30 days after  the day when they receive
that calculation unless during that period the  Executives and the
Institutions notify the Buyer that they disagree with  the calculation. Any
notice so given by the Executives and the Institutions  shall include,
reasonable details of the reason for any disagreement and  any suggested
amendment.  12.4 If any disagreement notified to the Buyer in accordance
with clause 12.3 is  not resolved within 14 days of being notified, the Buyer
or the Sellers\'  Representatives may refer the disagreement to the
Independent Accountants.  12.5 The Independent Accountants shall be
instructed in writing to deliver a  written determination of the matters in
dispute to the parties within 28  days of being instructed. Each party may
provide to the Independent  Accountants a written statement about the matters
in dispute. In making  their determination the Independent Accountants shall
act as experts and  not as arbitrators. The costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountants  shall be borne as they may determine in their
absolute discretion, having  regard to the relevant merits of the arguments
of each of the parties or,  if they make no determination, by the Sellers as
to 50% and by the Buyer as  to 50%.  12.6 In the absence of fraud or
manifest error, the decision of the Independent  Accountants and any
determination, calculation, statement or accounts  required to be provided by
them by this Agreement, shall be final and  binding on the parties for all
purposes.  12.7 Each party shall promptly provide to each of the other
parties and to the  Independent Accountants all such assistance,
documentation and information  as may be reasonably requested for
the       purpose of preparing or reviewing the Completion Accounts and
each  calculation delivered or to be delivered under this clause 12 within
the  time periods specified in this Agreement. In the event that any party
fails  to co-operate with or grant access to or supply any assistance, 
documentation or information requested by the Independent Accountants  within
any time specified by this Agreement, the Independent Accountants  shall in
their absolute discretion be entitled to make such assumptions for  the
purposes of making their determination as a result of that failure as  they
may in their absolute discretion determine.  12.8 As soon as deemed agreed
pursuant to clause 12 or determined pursuant to  clause 12 or otherwise
agreed between the parties, the calculation of the  Net Cash shall become
final and binding on the parties for all purposes.  The agreement or
determination of any such certificate and its contents, to  the extent not
taking into account any matter subsequently giving rise to a  Claim, shall
not (subject to clause 8 and Schedule 6, and provided and to  the extent that
such Claim is not allowed, reserved or provided for in the  Completion
Accounts) prevent the Buyer from asserting that Claim or limit  the damages
recoverable.  12.9 Within 10 Business Days of the calculation of the Net
Cash becoming final  and binding on the parties in accordance with this
clause 12:   (a) if the Completion Accounts Date is 31 July 2006, then:  
(i) if the Net Cash is less than $36,500,000, the Shareholders shall  pay to
the Buyer in cash and in US$ an aggregate sum equal to the  shortfall;  
(ii) if the Net Cash is more than $40,500,000, the Buyer shall pay to  the
Sellers\' Solicitors\' Client Account on behalf of the  Shareholders in cash
and in US$ an aggregate sum equal to the  excess up to an aggregate sum of
US$2,500,000; and   (iii) if the Net Cash is between $36,500,000 and
$40,500,000, no  adjustment shall be made; or   (b) if the Completion
Accounts Date is 31 August 2006, then:   (i) if the Net Cash is less than
$32,800,000, the Shareholders shall  pay to the Buyer in cash and in US$ an
aggregate sum equal to the  shortfall;   (ii) if the Net Cash is more than
$36,800,000, the Buyer shall pay to  the Sellers\' Solicitors\' Client
Account on behalf of the  Shareholders in cash and in US$ an aggregate sum
equal to the  excess up to an aggregate sum of US$2,500,000; and   (iii) if
the Net Cash is between $32,800,000 and $36,800,000, no  adjustment shall be
made;   (c) if the Completion Accounts Date is 30 September 2006, then:  
(i) if the Net Cash is less than $35,000,000 the Shareholders shall  pay to
the Buyer in cash and in US$ an aggregate sum equal to the  shortfall;  
(ii) if the Net Cash is more than $39,000,000 the Buyer shall pay to  the
Sellers\' Solicitors\' Client Account on behalf of the  Shareholders in cash
and in US$ an aggregate sum equal to the  excess up to an aggregate sum of
US$2,500,000; and   (iii) if the Net Cash is between $35,000,000 and
$39,000,000, no  adjustment shall be made. or        (d) if the
Completion Accounts Date is after 15 October 2006 and prior to  the Longstop
Date, then:   (i) if the Net Cash is less than $36,500,000 the Shareholders
shall  pay to the Buyer in cash and in US$ an aggregate sum equal to the 
shortfall;   (ii) if the Net Cash is more than $40,500,000 the Buyer shall
pay to  the Sellers\' Solicitors\' Client Account on behalf of the 
Shareholders in cash and in US$ an aggregate sum equal to the  excess up to
an aggregate sum of US$2,500,000; and   (iii) if the Net Cash is between
$36,500,000 and $40,500,000, no  adjustment shall be made.  12.10 In the
event that a payment is due to the Buyer under clause 12.9(a)(i), 
12.9(b)(i), 12.9(c)(i) or 12.9(d)(i) (the "Buyer Completion Adjustment"), 
the Sellers\' Representatives and the Buyer shall instruct the Completion 
Escrow Agents to pay to the Buyer out of the Completion Escrow Account the 
lesser of:   (a) the Buyer Completion Adjustment; and   (b) the amount
outstanding to the credit of the Completion Escrow Account.  12.11 In the
event that the amount standing to the credit of the Completion  Escrow
Account is not sufficient to discharge the Buyer Completion  Adjustment in
full, then the balance of the Buyer Completion Adjustment  shall be payable
by the Sellers to the Buyer with immediate effect, and the  portion of the
balancing payment for which each Seller shall be liable  shall be an amount
pro rata to the proportion of the funds standing to the  credit of the
Completion Escrow Account to which he would have been  entitled had clause
12.12 below been applicable. The obligations of the  Sellers under this
clause shall be several and proportionate.  12.12 In the event that the
amount standing to the credit of the Completion  Escrow Account is greater
than the Buyer Completion Adjustment, then after  payment of the Buyer
Completion Adjustment the balance remaining in the  Completion Escrow Account
shall, subject to the provisions of paragraph 3.2  of Part 1 of Schedule 7,
be for the account of the Shareholders and shall  be dealt with in accordance
with the provisions of Part 5 of Schedule 11  and the Sellers\'
Representatives and the Buyer shall instruct the  Completion Escrow Agents to
make the payment to this effect.  12.13 In the event that the payment is due
under clause 12.9(a)(ii),  12.9(b)(ii), 12.9(c)(ii) or 12.9(d)(ii) (the
"Sellers\' Completion  Adjustment"):   (a) the Buyer shall pay the amount
of the Sellers\' Completion Adjustment;  and   (b) the Sellers\'
Representatives and the Buyer shall instruct the  Completion Escrow Agents,
after first deducting any Indemnity Amount  (as such term is defined in
paragraph 3.2 of Part 1 of Schedule 7)  which shall be payable to the
Sellers\' Solicitors\' Client Account for  the account of the Executives
and/or the Management Shareholders (as  appropriate), to release from the
Completion Escrow Account the entire  amount standing to the credit of the
Completion Escrow Amount,   the aggregate of the two amounts in paragraphs
(a) and (b) above being paid  to the Shareholders in accordance with Part 4
of Schedule 11.  12.14 In the event that there is no adjustment to be made
under clause  12.9(a)(iii), 12.9(b)(iii), 12.9(c)(iii) or 12.9(d)(iii) the
Sellers\'  Representatives and the Buyer shall instruct the Completion Escrow
Agents,  after first deducting any Indemnity Amount (as such term is defined
in  paragraph 3.2 of Part 1 of Schedule 7) which shall be payable to the 
Sellers\' Solicitors\' Client Account for the account of the Executives 
and/or the Management Shareholders (as appropriate), to release from    the
Completion Escrow Account the entire amount standing to the credit of  the
Completion Escrow Amount and for such amount to be paid to the  Shareholders
in accordance with Part 4 of Schedule 11.  12.15 Any payment to be made to
the Sellers and/or Shareholders pursuant to this  clause 12 shall be made to
the Sellers\' Solicitors Client Account.  12.16 Any payment to be made to
the Buyer pursuant to this clause 12 shall be  made to the account notified
by the Buyer to the Sellers\' Representatives.  13 ANNOUNCEMENTS  13.1
Save for the Press Release and subject to clause 13.2 and clause 13.3, the 
parties shall not make any public announcement or issue a press release or 
respond to any enquiry from the press or other media concerning or relating 
to this Agreement or its subject matter or any ancillary matter.  13.2 The
Institutions shall be entitled to issue their own respective press  releases
in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  provided that
such press releases are issued no earlier than the date  falling 5 Business
Days after the date of issue of the Press Release and  provided that the
Buyer has first given its prior written consent to each  such press release,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed  (save that the
Buyer\'s consent shall not be required where the press  release is to the
Institutions\' own respective investor groups and the  content of such
release does not conflict with any information contained in  the Press
Release). The Buyer shall be entitled to issue press releases in  respect of
such transactions provided that those press releases do not  conflict with
any information contained in the Press Release.  13.3 Any party may make or
permit to be made an announcement concerning or  relating to this Agreement
or its subject matter or any ancillary matter if  and to the extent required
by:   (a) law; or   (b) any securities exchange on which that party\'s
securities (or the  securities of any person connected with that party) are
listed or  traded; or   (c) any court or regulatory or governmental or
other authority with  relevant powers to which any party is subject or

that (except in the normal  course of their respective duties as directors
and/or employees of any of  the Companies or with the written consent of the
Buyer) he or she shall not  and persons connected with him or her shall
not:   (a) save for a Permitted Interest, in the Restricted Period, be a

question had  dealings in the course of the business and who was reasonably
likely  at Completion to become a material client, customer, supplier, 
distributor or agent of or to any of the Companies;   (c) in the Restricted
Period interfere or seek to interfere with supplies  to any of the Companies

Companies or in respect of which any of the  Companies is bound by an
obligation of confidence to a third party,  save as required by any stock
exchange, or by law or by any court of  competent jurisdiction or by any
regulatory authority (in which case,  the Buyer shall be given reasonable
advance notice of any such  required disclosure).   Each undertaking
contained in this clause 14 shall be read and construed  independently of
each other undertaking in this clause 14 as an entirely  separate and
severable undertaking.  14.2 The Buyer and the Covenantors hereby confirm
and agree that they consider  that the undertakings in clause 14.1:   (a)
are reasonable in all the circumstances; and   (b) are of no greater
duration, extent and application than is necessary  for the protection of the
goodwill of the businesses of the Companies.   If any one or more of the
undertakings in clause 14.1 should for any reason  be held to be invalid but
would have been held to be valid if part of the  wording thereof was deleted
or the period thereof reduced or the range of  activities or area covered
thereby reduced in scope, the said undertakings  shall apply with the minimum
modifications necessary to make them valid and  effective.  14.3 The
restriction contained in clause 14.1(f) shall not extend to any  confidential
or secret information which may come into the public domain  otherwise than
through the default of, or other wrongful disclosure by, the 
Covenantors.  14.4 After Completion, save by virtue of their employment or
consulting  arrangements with any of the Companies, the Covenantors shall not
without  the Buyer\'s prior written consent hold themselves out as being
interested  in or in any way connected (other than as a matter of historic
fact) with  the Companies.  14.5 For the purposes of this clause 14:  
(a) "Permitted Interest" means:   (i) an interest in securities which are
held for investment purposes  comprising units of an authorised unit trust
and/or not more than  three per cent. (3%) of any class of the issued share
capital of  any company quoted or a recognised investment exchange (as 
defined in FSMA); and   (ii) a role as a consultant or employee in a
division or branch of a  company or business which division or branch does
not directly or  indirectly compete with      the Business and which
does not involve the Covenantors directly  or indirectly competing or
assisting any other person in  competition, with the Business in the ordinary
course of  employment notwithstanding that the company or business as a 
whole competes with the Business;   (b) "Covenantor" means each of Donald
Gibson, Jonathan Craton, Guy Dubois,  David Rice-Jones, Brian Buggy and Dave

Information.  15.2 Subject to clause 13.3 above, the Buyer undertakes that
it shall not, prior  to and on Completion, use or disclose any Non-
Disclosable Information and,  following Completion, not use or disclose any
Non-Disclosable Information  to the extent relating to the terms of this
Agreement or to any of the  Sellers.  15.3 Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, any party may use or  disclose Non-Disclosable
Information if and to the extent:   (a) such Non-Disclosable Information
forms part of the Press Release;   (b) required by law or by any securities
exchange on which that party\'s  securities (or the securities of any person
connected with that party)  are listed or traded;   (c) required by any
regulatory or governmental or other authority with  relevant powers to which
any party is subject or submits (whether or  not the authority has the force
of law);   (d) required to vest the full benefit of this Agreement in that
party or  to enforce any of the rights of that party in this Agreement;  
(e) required by its professional advisers, officers, employees,  consultants,
sub-contractors or agents to provide their services (and  subject always to
similar duties of confidentiality);   (f) that information is in or has come
into the public domain through no  fault of that party;   (g) the other
parties has given prior written consent to the disclosure;  and   (h) in
respect of Broadview, Kennet and HarbourVest, to the extent that  any of them
require disclosure of any such information to current or  potential investors
in funds managed or affiliated by or to them.  15.4 The restrictions
contained in this clause 15 shall continue to apply after  Completion without
limit in time.  16 ENTIRE AGREEMENT  16.1 This Agreement and the documents
referred to or incorporated in it  constitute the entire agreement between
the parties relating to the subject  matter of this Agreement and supersede
and extinguish any prior drafts,  agreements, undertakings, representations,
warranties and arrangements of  any nature whatsoever, whether or not in
writing, between the parties in  relation to the subject matter of this
Agreement.  16.2 Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that it has not
entered into  this Agreement in reliance on any statement or representation
of any person  (whether a party to this Agreement or       not) other
than as expressly incorporated in this Agreement and the Buyer  acknowledges
that none of the Sellers, nor their respective agents,  officers or employees
have given or shall be liable for any such statements  or representations
other than (in the case of each of the Sellers) as so  expressly
incorporated.  16.3 Nothing in this Agreement, or in any other document
referred to herein,  shall be read or construed as excluding or limiting any
liability or remedy  as a result of fraud.  16.4 Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and any other provision of  this Agreement
permitting termination each of the parties irrevocably and  unconditionally
waives any right or remedy it may have to claim damages  and/or to rescind
this Agreement by reason of any misrepresentation (other  than a fraudulent
misrepresentation and other than (in the case of a right  to claim damages)
any representation contained in the Warranties or the  warranties contained
in paragraphs 1 to 5 of Part 1 of Schedule 5) having  been made to it by any
person (whether party to this Agreement or not) and  upon which it has relied
in entering into this Agreement.  16.5 Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the only cause of action  available to it under the terms of this
Agreement shall be for breach of  contract or misrepresentation.  17
ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER  17.1 Subject to clause 17.2, no party shall be
entitled to assign, transfer or  create any trust in respect of the benefit
or burden of any provision of  this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Buyer (in the case  of a proposed assignment by any of the
Sellers) or all of Sellers (in the  case of a proposed assignment by the
Buyer).  17.2 The Buyer may novate this Agreement to a member of the
Buyer\'s Wholly-Owned  Group provided that (a) if such entity ceases to be a
member of the Buyer\'s  Wholly-Owned Group, such entity shall prior to so
ceasing novate this  Agreement to another member at that time of the Buyer\'s
Wholly-Owned Group,  (b) any such member of the Buyer\'s Wholly-Owned Group
will have only those  rights of action which the Buyer would have had, and
the liabilities and/or  obligations of each of the Sellers will not be
greater or more onerous than  those which each of the Sellers would have had,
in each case, were no such  novation to take place, provided that no such
novation shall be effected  until each of the Sellers have been provided with
a guarantee in form and  substance reasonably acceptable to them of the
obligations of the relevant  member of the Buyer\'s Wholly-Owned Group. For
the purpose of this clause  17.2 the Buyer\'s Wholly-Owned Group means the
Buyer and its wholly owned  subsidiaries from time to time. Each of the
Sellers shall on request sign  all such documents as may be necessary to
novate this Agreement to the  extent such novation is permitted by this
clause.  18 COSTS AND EXPENSES   Except as otherwise stated in this
Agreement, each party shall pay its own  costs and expenses in relation to
the negotiation, preparation, execution,  performance and implementation of
this Agreement and each document referred  to in this Agreement, save that
this clause 18 shall not prejudice the  right of either party to seek to
recover its costs in any litigation or  dispute resolution procedure which
may arise out of this Agreement. For the  avoidance of doubt, save for the
Transaction Costs no Group Company shall  itself bear any of these
costs.  19 NO SET-OFF   All payments to be made under this Agreement shall
be made in full without  any set-off or counterclaim and free from any
deduction or withholding save  as may be required by law in which event such
deduction or withholding  shall not exceed the minimum amount which it is
required by law to deduct  or withhold.       20 EFFECT OF
COMPLETION   This Agreement shall, to the extent that it remains to be
performed,  continue in full force and effect notwithstanding
Completion.  21 WAIVER  21.1 A waiver of any right, power, privilege or
remedy provided by this  Agreement must be in writing and may be given
subject to any conditions  thought fit by the grantor. For the avoidance of
doubt, any omission to  exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, power,

notification or is the subject of any investigation under the  Enterprise Act

Competition Act 1998 or any analogous legislation in any  jurisdiction in
which it carries on business.  21.2 No Group Company has received any notice
or communication of commencement  of a formal procedure, from or on behalf of

computations, information, accounts, forms and notices which  ought to have
been made by or in respect of each Group Company for the  purposes of
Taxation have been duly made, were completed on a proper basis  and were
submitted within the requisite time limits and all such documents  (and the
information contained therein) were, when they were submitted, and  remain
complete and accurate in all material respects.  23.2 No Group Company is,
nor has it been in the period of three years ending on  the date of this
Agreement, involved in any dispute with or investigation,  audit, discovery

Warrantors are aware, no such dispute, investigation, audit,  discovery or
enquiry is pending, planned, threatened or likely to arise.  23.3 Each Group
Company has duly paid all Taxation for which it is liable on or  before the
date on which that Taxation became due and has not, in the  period of three
years ending on the date of this Agreement incurred any  liability to pay any
interest or penalties in respect of any unpaid Tax or  default in respect of
any Tax matter.  23.4 Each Group Company has duly deducted and withheld all

payable by it and, to  the extent that such amounts have become due, has

provisions or reserve for Tax appearing in the Accounts are sufficient  to

to pay or account (whether or not the due date for payment or to  account has
arisen) in respect of any period ended on or before the  Accounts
Date.  23.7 No Group Company has a liability to pay any amount of, or in
respect of,  Tax which has arisen or will arise in respect of the period
commencing on  the Accounts Date and ending on Completion, save for:   (a)
Corporation tax (or its non-UK equivalent) payable in respect of  normal
trading profits;   (b) Income tax (or its non-UK equivalent) payable
pursuant to the PAYE  regulations (or non-UK equivalent payroll deduction

amounts that the Group Company in question is  contractually obliged to pay
to its employees and directors; and   (c) VAT (or non-EU sales tax) on
supplies of goods or services made by or  to the Group Company in the
ordinary course of its business.  23.8 No Group Company is, nor so far as
the Warrantors are aware is likely to  become, liable to pay, or make
reimbursement or indemnity in respect of,  any Tax (or amounts corresponding
to Tax) in consequence of the failure by  any other person (other than
another Group Company) to discharge that Tax  within any specified period or
otherwise where that Tax relates to a  profit, income or gain, transaction,
event, omission or circumstance  arising, occurring or deemed to arise or
occur (whether wholly or partly)  on or before the date of this
Agreement.  23.9 Each Group Company has obtained, maintained and has readily
available to it  complete, accurate and up to date records as required for

which are  necessary to prove the title of any Group Company to any asset
owned or  possessed by it have been duly and properly stamped and all UK
stamp duty  (or non-UK equivalent) payable in respect of such documents has
been paid.  23.12 No goods or services have been supplied or received, or
agreed to be  supplied or received, by a Group Company for consideration
which is more or  less valuable than the consideration that would have been
paid or agreed  between unconnected third parties such that an adjustment
has, could or  should be made, for Tax purposes, to the actual consideration
paid or  agreed to be paid by or to the Group Company in question.  23.13
No Group Company has entered into any transaction or series of  transactions,
scheme or arrangement of which the main purpose, or one of  the main
purposes, was the avoidance or reduction of a Taxation liability  or for
which there was no commercial purpose; and no Group Company has ever  been
under a liability to disclose an arrangement under the provisions of  Part 7
of the Finance Act 2004 or to provide the reference number assigned  to any
such arrangement to a Tax Authority.  23.14 Each Group Company which is
required to be registered for VAT purposes has  been so registered and its
registration is not subject to any conditions  imposed by or agreed with any
Tax Authority. No Group Company makes or has  made supplies which are exempt
for VAT purposes.       PART 3: BUYER\'S WARRANTIES  1 ORGANISATION

remedy and is remedied to  the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer by the
Warrantors (or any of them  or any other Seller) within 60 days of the date
on which the notice in  paragraph 3.1 above is received by the relevant

liability (rather than on the Completion Date) and (b)  the period of nine
and twelve months referred to in paragraph 3.2 shall in  the case of any such

shall not bring a Claim against only one of the Warrantors  without bringing
the Claim against the other Warrantors. The Buyer  undertakes to the
Warrantors that it will enforce Claims that are Settled  against each of the
Warrantors (other than Year 1 Claims to the extent that  payment in
Settlement thereof is made from the Escrow Account) and will not  seek to
enforce such Claims against some and not all of the Warrantors. The  Buyer
further undertakes to the Warrantors that it will not directly or  indirectly
financially assist (with money or money\'s worth) or otherwise  reimburse any
Warrantor or any person connected with that Warrantor in  respect of such
Claim other than by way of any contribution towards that  Warrantor\'s legal
fees to the extent required by court order or as part of  any Settlement of
that Claim.  6.2 No liability shall attach to the Warrantors for Year 1
Claims unless the  aggregate cumulative amount payable by the Warrantors for
all those Year 1  Claims exceeds US$4,000,000 (the "General Basket"), in
which case the Buyer  may recover all of such amount and not only the excess
from the Warrantors.      6.3 Save as provided in paragraph 6.6 of this
Schedule, which shall apply to  the exclusion of this paragraph 6.3, no
liability shall attach to the  Warrantors for Year 2 to 3 Claims or for Year
4 to 5 Claims unless the  aggregate cumulative amount payable by the
Warrantors exceeds US$10,000,000  (the "Subsequent Basket") and in any such
case the Buyer may recover all of  such amount and not only the excess from
the Warrantors, provided that the  Buyer shall not be entitled to recover the
first US$5,000,000 in respect of  any such Claim.  6.4 Save in respect of
Share Capital Claims and claims for breach of warranty  under paragraph 5 of
Part 2 of Schedule 5, the Warrantors shall not be  liable for any Claim which
does not exceed US$150,000 (a "De Minimis  Claim") and no Claim which does
not exceed US$150,000 shall count towards  the Year 1 Basket or any
Subsequent Basket. For this purpose any Claims  arising out of the same
incident or matter shall be regarded as one single  Claim.  6.5 No
liability shall attach to the Warrantors in respect of a Tax Claim made 
pursuant to paragraph 1.1.9 of Part 2 of Schedule 8 unless the aggregate 
cumulative amount of the Tax Liability exceeds US$5,000,000 in such case  the
Buyer may recover an amount equal to the whole of the Tax Liability and  not
only the excess from the Warrantors. Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 shall  not
prevent liability attaching to the Warrantors in respect of Tax Claims  made
pursuant to paragraph 1.1.9 of Part 2 of Schedule 8.  6.6 For the purposes
of calculating Claims towards the General Basket and/or  any Subsequent
Basket and/or any De Minimis Claim there shall be excluded  from any Claim
the amount of any costs, expenses and other liabilities  (together with any
VAT thereon) incurred or to be incurred by the Buyer\'s  Group in connection
with the making of any such Claim.  7 CHANGES IN LEGISLATION   The
Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of a Claim to the extent that  such
Claim would not have arisen but for, or to the extent that it is  increased
as a result of:   (a) the passing of, or a change in, a law, applicable rule
or regulation,  interpretation by the courts of the law or administrative
practice of  a government, governmental department, agency or regulatory body
in  any case occurring on or after the date of this Agreement;   (b) an
increase in the Taxation rates or an imposition of Taxation in each  case not
actually or prospectively in force at the date of this  Agreement; or   (c)
the change by statute or by any regulatory or other body of any  accounting
policy or a change in the application of any accounting  policy or estimation
technique in the preparation of financial  statements by the Buyer or any
member of the Buyer\'s Group.  8 ACTS OF THE BUYER   The Warrantors shall
not be liable in respect of a Claim to the extent that  such Claim is
attributable to, or to the extent that it is increased as a  result of:  
(a) any act, omission, Transaction or arrangement carried out at the  written
request of or with the written approval of the Buyer or any  member of the
Buyer\'s Group in either case on or after Completion or  (to the extent set
out in the Disclosure Letter or Supplemental  Disclosure Letter) before
Completion and for these purposes, it is  hereby acknowledged that the
termination of the US 401K Plan is an act  which has been requested in
writing by the Buyer before Completion,  and accordingly the Warrantors shall
not be liable for any liability  incurred by any member of the Buyer\'s Group
arising directly or  indirectly as a result of such termination;   (b) any
act, omission, Transaction or arrangement carried out on or after  Completion
by or on behalf of the Buyer or on behalf of a member of  the Buyer\'s Group
or by or on behalf       of persons deriving title from the Buyer or a
member of the Buyer\'s  Group on or after Completion;   (c) any breach by
the Buyer of any of its obligations under this Agreement  or any obligations
entered into pursuant thereto; or   (d) any reorganisation or change in
ownership of any member of the Buyer\'s  Group on or after Completion.  9
MITIGATION   The Buyer shall comply with its common law obligations to
mitigate any loss  arising by reason of a breach of this Agreement.  10
RECOVERY FROM ANOTHER PERSON  10.1 PRIOR RECOVERY   If and to the extent
that the Buyer, or any member of the Buyer\'s Group,  has recovered (whether
by payment, discount, credit, relief or otherwise)  from a third party an
amount which reduces the losses suffered by the Buyer  in respect of any
Claim, such recovery (less any reasonable costs incurred  in obtaining such
recovery and less any Taxation attributable to the  recovery after taking
account of any tax relief available in respect of any  matter giving rise to
the relevant Claim) shall reduce or satisfy, as the  case may be, such
Claim.  10.2 SUBSEQUENT RECOVERY   If the Warrantors pay an amount in
respect of a Claim and the Buyer, or any  member of the Buyer\'s Group,
subsequently recovers (whether by payment,  discount, credit, relief or
otherwise) from a third party an amount which  if it had been recovered prior
to the payment by the Warrantors would have  reduced or satisfied that Claim
in accordance with paragraph 10.1, the  Buyer shall procure that the relevant
member of the Buyer\'s Group shall pay  to the Warrantors an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) the amount recovered  from the third party less any
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in  obtaining such recovery and (ii)
the amount previously paid by the  Warrantors to the Buyer.  11 CONDUCT OF
CLAIMS  11.1 THIRD PARTY CLAIMS   If a member of the Buyer\'s Group
becomes aware of any claim or putative  claim against any Group Company or
Buyer\'s Group by any third party (a  "Third Party Claim") which does or is
reasonably likely to give rise to a  Claim, or an entitlement of any Group
Company to recover (whether by  payment, discount, credit, relief or
otherwise) from a third party (a  "Third Party Entitlement") which relates to
the subject matter of any  Claim:   (a) to the extent not notified under
paragraph 3.1 the Buyer shall as soon  as reasonably practicable give written
notice of the Third Party Claim  or Third Party Entitlement to the Sellers\'
Representatives and shall  consult with them in respect of the Third Party
Claim or Third Party  Entitlement;   (b) the Buyer shall, and shall procure
that each member of the Buyer\'s  Group shall, ensure the following if and to
the extent that it  considers that by doing so it will not materially
prejudice either the  business and/or prospects of any member of the Group
and/or any rights  it may have against the Warrantors in respect of that
Claim:   (i) not make any admission of liability, compromise or settlement
of  any Claim without the written consent of the Seller\'s 
Representatives;       (ii) at the written request of the Sellers\'
Representatives and at the  cost of the Warrantors take such action or (at
the Sellers\'  Representatives\' option) permit the Sellers\' Representatives
to  take such action as the Sellers\' Representatives consider  appropriate
to avoid, dispute, resist, appeal, defend, compromise  or settle the Third
Party Claim or Third Party Entitlement  (including, without limitation, make
any counterclaims or other  claims against third parties) and any related
adjudication or  proceedings, and to conduct matters relating thereto
including  negotiations or appeals, subject to the Buyer and/or the
relevant  member of the Buyer\'s Group being indemnified for all costs and 
expenses;   (iii) provide to the Sellers\' Representatives and their
advisers  reasonable access during normal working hours to premises and 
personnel and to relevant assets, documents and records within  each member
of the Buyer\'s Group\'s power or control for the  purposes of investigating
the matter or entitlement which  allegedly gives rise to the Third Party
Claim or Third Party  Entitlement and/or defending the Third Party Claim or
Third Party  Entitlement subject to any duties of confidentiality owed to 
third parties; and   (iv) permit the Sellers\' Representatives (at the
Warrantors\' cost) to  examine and take copies of the documents or records,
and  photograph the premises or assets, referred to in paragraph 
11.1(b)(iii) above subject to any duties of confidentiality owed  to third
parties; and   (v) from the date when it first becomes aware of a Third
Party Claim  or Third Party Entitlement, the Buyer shall use all reasonable 
endeavours to preserve, and shall ensure that each member of the  Buyer\'s
Group shall use all reasonable endeavours to preserve all  documents,
records, correspondence, accounts, electronically  stored data and other
information whatsoever relevant to a matter  to the extent it believes that
the same may give rise to a Third  Party Claim or Third Party
Entitlement.  12 ALLOWANCE, PROVISION OR RESERVE IN THE COMPLETION
ACCOUNTS  12.1 No matter shall be subject to a Claim to the extent (and only
up to the  extent) that:   (a) allowance, provision or reserve in respect
of such matter shall have  been made in the Completion Accounts; or   (b)
such matter has been included in calculating creditors or deducted in 
calculating debtors in the Completion Accounts.  12.2 No amount shall be
included in the Completion Accounts that arises directly  or indirectly in
respect of the termination of the US401K Plan.  13 NO DOUBLE
RECOVERY  13.1 The Buyer\'s Group shall not be entitled to recover from the

Liability has already been withheld or deducted from  payments made to any
relevant individual (where and to the extent that  there was an entitlement
as against the relevant individual so to  withhold or deduct);   1.2.2 any
stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax or stamp duty land tax (or, in  each case,
any non-UK equivalent) paid by the Company after Completion  in respect of
any agreement, document or conveyance executed or  entered into on or before
Completion (other than any document executed  in connection with the
Agreement) where it is paid to establish the  Company\'s title to any asset
owned by the Company on or before  Completion or to enable the Buyer or the
Company to produce the  relevant document in evidence in any civil
proceedings before any  court or tribunal in the United Kingdom.   1.2.3
any Tax Liability of the Company arising directly or indirectly  pursuant to
or in relation to any of sections 83, 162, 280G or 409A of  the US Internal
Revenue Code in relation to any Event which occurred  on or before Completion
or the exercise, assignment, release,  assumption, vesting, roll over, sale
or any similar act or event  affecting, after Completion, any Options or Y
Shares.  1.3 Subject as provided in this Schedule, the Warrantors covenant
severally  with the Buyer to pay to the Buyer an amount equal to:   (a) any
Tax Liability of the Company or the Buyer (where such Tax  Liability relates
to an amount of inheritance tax); or   (b) any depletion in or reduction in
value of the assets or increase in  the liabilities of the Company or the
Buyer,   arising as a result of any charge on any of the Shares or on any of
the  assets of the Company relating to unpaid inheritance tax or any power
to  raise an amount of inheritance tax by sale or       mortgage of, or
terminable charge on, any of the Shares or any of the  assets of the Company
(or any part of them):   (c) where such charge or power exists at
Completion; or   (d) where the liability in respect of inheritance tax is
payable as a  result of:   (i) the failure of any person to pay an amount
in respect of  inheritance tax; or   (ii) the death of any person within
seven years after a transfer of  value (or a deemed transfer of value);  
PROVIDED THAT the transfer of value (or deemed transfer of value) to which 
the inheritance tax liability relates occurred on or prior to
Completion.  1.4 Subject as provided in this Schedule, the Warrantors
covenant severally  with the Buyer to pay to the Buyer an amount equal to all
costs and  expenses reasonably and properly incurred or payable by the Buyer
or the  Company in connection with or in consequence of any successful Tax
Claim.  2 GENERAL  2.1 In determining for the purposes of paragraph 1 of
this part whether a  charge on or power to sell, mortgage or charge any of
the Shares or assets  of the Company exists at any time and in determining
the amount of the Tax  Liability arising, the fact that any inheritance tax
is not yet payable or  may be paid by instalments shall be disregarded and
such inheritance tax  shall be treated as becoming due and a charge or power
to sell, mortgage or  charge as arising on the date of the transfer of value
or other date or  event on or in respect of which it becomes payable or
arises.  2.2 The provisions of section 213 IHTA shall not apply to any
payments falling  to be made pursuant to a Tax Claim.  2.3 Any payment made
by the Warrantors to the Buyer pursuant to this Schedule  shall, so far as
possible, be a reduction in or refund of the consideration  payable or paid
by the Buyer to the Warrantors pursuant to this Agreement  to the extent
permissible by law.  2.4 In respect of any accounting period of the Company
which is current at  Completion, it shall be assumed for the purposes of this
Agreement that the  Completion Date is the last day of that accounting period
and the amount of  any provision for Tax or any Relief relating to such
period shall be  calculated accordingly for the purposes of determining any
liability of the  Warrantors under this Agreement.       PART 3:
MISCELLANEOUS, INCLUDING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS, CONDUCT  OF CLAIMS AND
PAYMENTS  1 CORRESPONDING BENEFIT  1.1 Where:   1.1.1 a Tax Liability of
the Company has been discharged and has resulted  in a Relief for the Company
which would not otherwise have arisen (a  "Relevant Relief"); and   1.1.2
the Warrantors have made a payment to the Buyer in respect of such  Tax
Liability under either the Tax Covenant or the Tax Warranties,   upon the
Company utilising the Relevant Relief, an amount equivalent to the  lesser
of:   1.1.3 the amount of Tax which the Company would have been liable to
pay but  for the utilisation of the Relevant Relief (less an amount equal
to  any costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Buyer or the Company 
in obtaining the Relevant Relief); and   1.1.4 the amount paid by the
Warrantors in respect of the Tax Liability  giving rise to the Relevant
Relief save to the extent that such amount  constitutes a reimbursement of
the costs and/or expenses reasonably  and properly incurred by the Buyer or
the Company in obtaining the  payment from the Warrantors; and   shall
firstly be set off against any payment then due from the Warrantors  pursuant
to the Warranties or the Tax Covenant and secondly, to the extent  that there
is an excess, be refunded to the Warrantors.  1.2 For the purposes of
paragraph 1.1, the Company shall not be regarded as  utilising a Relevant
Relief until the last date upon which both:   1.2.1 the Company would have
been obliged to make an actual payment of Tax  (which it would otherwise have
had to have paid but for the Relevant  Relief) or, in the case of a Relevant
Relief consisting of a right to  repayment of Tax, the date on which the
Company receives cleared funds  in respect of such repayment; and   1.2.2
no Tax Authority is able to argue that the Relevant Relief in  question was
not in fact available to be used.  1.3 Nothing in this paragraph 1 shall
oblige the Company to utilise a Relevant  Relief in priority to any other
Relief then available to it or to maximise  the amount of any Relevant Relief
and the Company shall for the purposes of  this paragraph be deemed to use
all other Reliefs then available to it, as  permitted by law, as though the
Relevant Relief did not exist, in priority  to the Relevant Relief in
determining when the Relevant Relief is utilised  but, subject to the above,
the Company shall use its reasonable endeavours  to utilise and maximise the
Relevant Relief.  1.4 A payment pursuant to this paragraph 1 shall be made
three Business Days  before the date on which the Company would have been
liable to make the  payment of Tax but for the Relevant
Relief.      1.5 The Warrantors shall be entitled to require, and the
Buyer shall procure,  that the Company\'s auditors shall (at the Warrantors\'
cost) certify the  amount of any payment due under this paragraph 1.  1.6
If and to the extent that a Group Company obtains and utilises corporation 
tax relief pursuant to Part 3 of Schedule 23 of the Finance Act 2003 in 
consequence of the exercise of any Option (a "Buffer Relief"), than an 
amount equal to the corporation tax saved as a result of the utilisation of 
a Buffer Relief, less an amount equal to any costs and expenses reasonably 
incurred by the Buyer or the Group Company in obtaining and utilising the 
Buffer Relief, shall be set off against any payment due from the Warrantors 
in respect of a Tax Claim made in the accounting period in which the Buffer 
Relief is utilised and for these purposes a Buffer Relief shall be utilised 
by the relevant Group Company in priority to any other relief available to 
it or any other member of the Buyer\'s group (including any other Group 
Company).  2. THIRD PARTY RECOVERY  2.1 If the Warrantors have paid an
amount to the Buyer in respect of a Tax  Liability (pursuant either to the
Tax Covenant or the Tax Warranties) and  the Company or the Buyer has
received a payment or obtained a  reimbursement, refund, credit or set-off
from any person (other than the  Buyer, the Company or any officer or
employee of the Company) in respect of  the Tax Liability or has (whether by
operation of law, contract or  otherwise) a right of reimbursement or refund
against any other person or  persons (other than the Buyer or the Company) in
respect of the Tax  Liability, the Buyer shall:   2.1.1 notify the
Warrantors as soon as reasonably practicable; and   2.1.2 in the case of a
right of reimbursement or refund, if so requested in  writing by the
Warrantors and if the Warrantors indemnify and secure  the Buyer, to the
Buyer\'s reasonable satisfaction, against all  reasonable and proper costs
and expenses and any Tax Liability or  additional Tax Liability of the Buyer
or the Company arising (or which  may arise) as a result of any action taken
pursuant to this paragraph,  procure that the Company shall take reasonable
steps to enforce the  right, keeping the Warrantors reasonably informed of
any progress.  2.2 Where the Buyer or the Company receives an amount from a
third party  pursuant to paragraph 2.1, an amount equal to the lesser of:  
2.2.1 the amount paid by the Warrantors under this Schedule in respect of 
the Tax Liability in question save to the extent that such amount 
constitutes a reimbursement of the costs and/or expenses reasonably  and
properly incurred by the Buyer or the Company in obtaining such  amount from
the Warrantors; and   2.2.2 the amount received by the Buyer or the Company
from any third party  pursuant to this paragraph less:   2.2.2.1 any costs
and/or expenses reasonably and properly incurred by  the Buyer or Company in
obtaining such amount from such third  party; and   2.2.2.2 any Tax which
the Company or the Buyer reasonably anticipates  will be payable in respect
of such receipt (or any Tax which it  is reasonably anticipated
would       have been payable in respect thereof but for the
availability of  a Relief of the type described in paragraph 2.1.2 or 2.1.3
of  part 1),   shall firstly be set off against any payment then due from
the Warrantors  pursuant to the Warranties or the Tax Covenant and secondly,
to the extent  that there is an excess, be refunded to the Warrantors.  3.
GROSSING-UP OF PAYMENTS  3.1 Any amount payable by the Warrantors to the
Buyer pursuant to a Tax Claim  shall be paid free and clear of all deductions
or withholdings whatsoever,  save only as may be required by any applicable
law.  3.2 If any deduction or withholding is required by law to be made from
any  amount payable pursuant to a Claim, the Warrantors shall be obliged to
pay  to the Buyer such increased amount as will, after the deduction or 
withholding has been made, leave the Buyer with the same amount as it would 
have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to  make
a deduction or withholding.  3.3 In the event that any amount paid to the
Buyer pursuant to a Claim is or  will be chargeable to Tax, the Warrantors
shall be obliged to pay such  increased amount as will, after payment of the
Tax, leave the Buyer with  the same amount that would otherwise have been
payable if Tax had not been  so chargeable and for these purposes an amount
shall be regarded as  chargeable to Tax in circumstances where it would have
been so chargeable  but for the use or set off of a Relief available to the
Buyer PROVIDED that  if at the time of payment (or any other relevant time)
the Buyer is not  resident in the United Kingdom the Warrantors shall be
liable under this  paragraph 3.3 for such amount as the Warrantors would have
been liable for  had the Buyer been resident in the United Kingdom.  4. DUE
DATE FOR PAYMENT  4.1 Where the Warrantors become liable to make any payment
pursuant to a Tax  Claim, the due date for the making of the payment shall
be:   4.1.1 where the payment relates to a liability of the Company to make
an  actual payment of Tax, the later of three Business Days prior to the 
last date on which that payment of Tax can be made and five Business  Days
after service of a notice on the Warrantors of their liability to  make a
payment;   4.1.2 where the payment relates to the use or set off of a
Relief, the  later of three Business Days prior to the last date on which
the  Company would have been liable to make a payment of Tax but for such 
use or set off and five Business Days after service of notice on the 
Warrantors of their liability to make a payment by the Buyer;   4.1.3 where
the payment relates to the loss of a right to repayment of Tax,  the later of
the date on which that repayment would otherwise have  become due and five
Business Days after the service of notice on the  Warrantors of their
liability to make a payment;   4.1.4 where the payment relates to the loss
of a Relief (not being a right  of repayment of Tax) the later of three
Business Days before a payment  of Tax is due from the Company which
would       not have been due had that Relief not been lost and five
Business Days  after service of notice on the Warrantors of their liability
to make a  payment; and   4.1.5 in any other case, the date falling five
Business Days after the date  of service of a notice on the Warrantors of
their liability to make a  payment.  5. CONDUCT OF TAX DEMANDS  5.1 If
any Tax Demand is received by or comes to the notice of the Buyer or the 
Company the Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, give or procure 
to be given to the Warrantors written notice of the Tax Demand PROVIDED  THAT
the giving of such notice shall not be a condition precedent to the 
liability of the Warrantors under this Schedule in respect of the Tax 
Demand. If any Tax Demand is received by or comes to the notice of the 
Warrantors, the Warrantors shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, give 
the Buyer written notice of the Tax Demand.  5.2 If so requested in writing
by the Warrantors, and if the Warrantors  indemnify the Buyer, to the
Buyer\'s reasonable satisfaction, against the  relevant Tax Liability, any
additional Tax Liability (including interest  and penalties in respect of
Tax) and all reasonable costs and expenses  which the Buyer or the Company
may incur as a result of any action taken  pursuant to this paragraph, the
Warrantors shall be entitled to request  that the Buyer takes, or procures
that the Company shall take, such action  as the Warrantors may reasonably
direct to dispute, resist, appeal or  compromise the Tax Liability PROVIDED
THAT:   5.2.1 the Buyer or the Company shall not be required to delegate
the  conduct of such action to the Warrantors or any agent or professional 
adviser of the Warrantors;   5.2.2 the Buyer shall not be required to make
or procure the making of a  formal appeal to any tribunal, court, appellate
body or judicial  authority unless the Warrantors, at their own expense and
after  disclosure of all relevant information and documents, obtain and 
deliver to the Buyer an opinion from appropriate counsel, who has been 
approved for the purpose by the Buyer (such approval not to be  unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and who has specialised in relevant  Tax matters for a
minimum of ten years, that the appeal will, on the  balance of probabilities,
be successful;   5.2.3 the Buyer shall keep the Warrantors informed as to
the progress and  consequences of such action and shall consult with the
Warrantors as  to any material action to be taken and shall take into account
their  reasonable comments;   5.2.4 the Buyer shall not be required to make
any settlement or compromise  of the relevant Tax Liability which in its
reasonable opinion is  likely to affect materially any future Tax Liability
of the Company or  of the Buyer; and   5.2.5 no material communication
pertaining to the Tax Demand shall be sent  to the relevant Tax Authority
without having first been made available  to the Warrantors for comments (any
such comments to be provided to  the Buyer within a reasonable time) and all
such comments of the  Warrantors as are reasonable shall be incorporated or
rejected in the  relevant communication.  5.3 If the Warrantors make the
request and provide the indemnity referred to in  paragraph 5.2, the Buyer
shall procure that the Company shall, on  reasonable prior notice from the
Warrantors in      writing, provide the Warrantors with such information
and assistance in  connection with the affairs of the Company relevant to the
Tax Liability  which is in dispute as the Warrantors may reasonably
request.  5.4 The Buyer or the Company shall, without reference to the
Warrantors, be  entitled to admit, compromise, settle, discharge or otherwise
deal with a  Tax Demand on such terms as it may, in its absolute discretion,
think fit  and without prejudice to any right or remedy under this Schedule
or this  Agreement:   5.4.1 if the Warrantors have not made the request and
provided the  indemnity referred to in paragraph 5.2 by the earlier of the
following  dates:   5.4.1.1 the date being ten Business Days after the date
on which  notice of the Tax Demand was given pursuant to paragraph 5.1 or 
notice of the Tax Demand came to the attention of the Warrantors;  and  
5.4.1.2 the date being five Business Days prior to the last date on  which an
appeal may be made against the Tax Liability to which  the Tax Demand relates
PROVIDED THAT the Warrantors have had  notice of the Tax Demand at least five
Business Days prior to  that date;   5.4.2 if written notice is served on
the Company or the Buyer by the  Warrantors to the effect that they consider
that the Tax Demand should  no longer be resisted;   5.4.3 if within the
period of ten Business Days following the service of a  written notice by the
Buyer on the Warrantors requiring the Warrantors  to clarify or explain the
terms of any request made under paragraph  5.2, no reasonably satisfactory
written clarification or explanation  is received by the Buyer within that
period;   5.4.4 upon the expiry of any period prescribed by applicable
legislation  for the making of an appeal against either the Tax Demand in
question  or the decision of any court or tribunal in respect of any such
Tax  Demand, as the case may be;   5.4.5 if a Tax Authority alleges that
while the Company was under the  collective control of the Sellers there was
any act or failure to act  by the Company or any of the Sellers in connection
with the Tax  Liability which constitutes fraud.  6. EXCLUSIONS AND
LIMITATIONS  6.1 The Warrantors\' liability in relation to any Tax Claim
shall be limited as  described (mutatis mutandis) in Schedule 6 (for the
avoidance of doubt,  other than to the extent specifically excluded by
paragraph 16 of Schedule  6).  6.2 The Warrantors shall not be liable in
respect of any Tax Claim in respect  of any Tax Liability to the extent
that:   6.2.1 provision or reserve for such Tax Liability (excluding any
provision  or reserve for deferred taxation) is included within the
calculation  of the Tax Amount forming part of Net Cash (as the calculation
of Net  Cash is final and binding on the parties for the purposes of this 
Agreement) and/or employer\'s national insurance contributions of up to 
L603,000 which        would otherwise be taken into account in the
Working Capital Deficit  Amount in the absence of the principle contained in
the definition of  Working Capital Deficit Amount that states that only
amounts in excess  of L603,000 should be included in the Working Capital
Deficit Amount;  or   6.2.2 it arises or is increased as a result of any
increase in the rates of  Tax announced and coming into force with
retrospective effect after  the date of Completion; or   6.2.3 it arises or
is increased as a result of any imposition of new Tax or  the introduction of
or change in any legislation or applicable law or  the change in the
published practice of or concessions made by any Tax  Authority announced and
taking effect with retrospective effect after  the date of Completion; or  
6.2.4 such liability arises or is increased by virtue of the failure or 
omission by the Company to make any claim, election, surrender or  disclaimer
or give any notice or consent to any other matter or do any  other thing
after Completion (otherwise than at the request of all of  the Sellers), the
making, giving or doing of which was taken into  account or assumed in
computing any provision or reserve for Tax in  the Completion Accounts and
where sufficient details of such claim,  election, surrender, disclaimer,
notice or consent are included in the  Disclosure Letter with specific
reference to this paragraph; or   6.2.5 recovery has already been made in
respect of the Tax Liability by the  Buyer under the Tax Warranties, the Tax
Covenant or any other  provision of this Agreement:   6.2.6 the Tax
Liability arises or is increased as a result of any change in  the accounting
reference date of the Company after Completion or a  voluntary change in the
accounting policy or practice made after  Completion, other than as necessary
in order to comply with generally  accepted accounting practice or as a
result of a change in generally  accepted accounting practice made after
Completion with retrospective  effect;   6.2.7 it arises from a failure to
make or insufficiency of an instalment  payment of corporation tax where that
failure or insufficiency arises  as a result of the profits, income or gains
of the Company after  Completion proving to be greater in amount than the
profits, income or  gains than ought reasonably to have been expected at the
date the  relevant instalment payment was made; or   6.2.8 the Tax
Liability would not have arisen or been increased but for a  voluntary act,
omission, transaction or arrangement of the Buyer or  any of the Companies
carried out after Completion otherwise than in  the ordinary course of
business of the Companies and which the Buyer  or any of the Companies knew
or ought reasonably have known would give  rise to such a Tax Liability save
to the extent that such Tax  Liability has reduced any other Tax Liability
which would have formed  the basis of a successful claim under this Schedule
8 and (unless and  to the extent that the Tax Liability is thereby increased)
save to the  extent that the Tax Liability arises pursuant to paragraph
1.1.9(b) of  Part 2 of Schedule 8; or   6.2.9 the Tax Liability arises in
connection with the Buyer\'s refusal to  incorporate the Sellers\' comments
properly provided pursuant to clause  7.2.1 or 7.4 save to the extent that
the Tax Liability arises pursuant  to paragraph 1.1.9(b) of Part 2 of
Schedule 8 (unless and to the  extent that the Tax Liability is thereby
increased); or        6.2.10 it is a Tax Liability comprised in the
Notified Withholding Amount.  7. TAX RETURNS  7.1 It is hereby agreed that
the Buyer shall at its cost be responsible for and  have control of the
following matters:   7.1.1 the preparation of the corporation tax
computations and returns of  each Group Company for all accounting periods of
the Group Companies  ended on or before Completion;   7.1.2 the submission
of such computations and returns to the appropriate  Tax Authority and all
negotiations, correspondence and agreements with  respect thereto;   7.1.3
the preparation and submission of all such notices, claims and  elections
relating to corporation tax as the Buyer may reasonably deem  appropriate be
made by the Group Companies in connection with such  computations or returns;
and   7.1.4 the notification to the Warrantors of the amounts of corporation
tax  payable in respect of such accounting periods.  7.2 The Buyer
shall:   7.2.1 at all times keep the Warrantors informed as to the state of
any  negotiations referred to at paragraph 7.1.2 above and shall ensure 
that no computations and/or returns are submitted and that no 
correspondence, pleading or other document (other than  acknowledgements) is
sent, transmitted, issued or in any way published  in connection with the
negotiations by the Buyer or its advisers  without prior submission to the
Warrantors and their professional  advisers for their comments (such comments
not to be unreasonably  withheld or delayed, but in any event to be received
by the Buyer  within 10 Business Days) which comments the Buyer shall not 
unreasonably refuse to incorporate before sending, transmitting,  issuing or
publishing the same to the extent that such comments relate  to matters which
are reasonably likely to give rise to a Tax Claim  except that the Buyer will
not be obliged to incorporate such comments  if the Buyer reasonably
considers the effect of not doing so is  reasonably likely to give rise to a
Tax Claim which would be less than  another Tax Claim which would or could
result from incorporating such  comments;   7.2.2 on requiring a Group
Company to sign or enter into any computation,  claim, notice, election,
return or other document, provide to the  Warrantors such information in its
possession or that of its agents as  is reasonably necessary to enable the
Warrantors to review the same;   7.2.3 not be entitled to require a Group
Company to make any claim or  election which would result in a Tax Claim
arising as a result of:   7.2.3.1 any income, profit or gain accruing on a
disposal by any  company (other than any of the Group Companies) being
treated as  accruing in any of the Group Companies; or   7.2.3.2 the
consideration for the acquisition of, or of the interest  in, any asset owned
by any of the Group Companies being treated  for Tax purposes as reduced;
and   7.2.4 seek to agree such computations and settle the Tax affairs of
each  Group Company for the accounting periods ended on or before
Completion  as soon as reasonably practicable.  7.3 The Warrantors shall
give such assistance as may be reasonably required to  enable the corporation
tax computations and returns referred to in  paragraph 7.1 to be prepared,
authorised, signed and        submitted to the appropriate Tax
Authority and to give to the Buyer, at no  cost, such reasonable assistance
as may be reasonably required to agree  such computations and returns with
the appropriate Tax Authority.  7.4 It is hereby agreed that the Buyer shall
at its own cost be responsible for  the preparation, submission and
negotiation of the corporation tax  computations and returns of each Group
Company for the accounting period  current at Completion (provided that the
Buyer shall not require a Group  Company to take the action set out in
paragraph 7.2.3 above), and in  relation to that accounting period, the Buyer
shall at least 10 Business  Days prior to submitting such computations and
returns to the relevant Tax  Authority, submit them (together with such
information as is reasonably  necessary to enable the Warrantors to review
the same) to the Warrantors  and their professional advisers for their
comments (such comments not to be  unreasonably withheld or delayed but in
any event to be received by the  Buyer within 10 Business Days), and the
Buyer shall not unreasonably refuse  to incorporate such comments before
sending and transmitting such  computations and returns to the extent that
such comments relate to matters  which is reasonably likely to give rise to a
Tax Claim except that the  Buyer will not be obliged to incorporate such
comments if the Buyer  reasonably considers the effect of not doing so is
reasonably likely to  give rise to a Tax Claim which would be less than
another Tax Claim which  would or could result from incorporating such
comments.  8. SELLERS\' REPRESENTATIVES   Each of the Warrantors
authorises the Sellers\' Representatives to act on  their behalf in respect
of Tax Claims on the terms of clauses 6.1 to 6.6  inclusive, with such
amendments as are necessary to refer to the provisions  of the Tax Covenant,
but for the avoidance of doubt, with full authority to  receive and provide
notice, consent, indemnity, to make and receive  payments.

pursuant to paragraph 1.1(k) of Part 1 of Schedule 3,  converted into US$ at
the Completion Exchange Rate;   B2 = the number (as at the relevant date
when a calculation of the Total  Sum is required for the purposes of this
schedule) of Shares which are  the subject of Unvested Options in respect of
which an election is  made under an Option Instruction Form by the holders of
those Options  to cancel them in exchange for Rollover Options, multiplied by
the  exercise price of such Options, converted into US$ at the Completion 
Exchange Rate;   B3 = the number (as at the relevant date when a calculation
of the Total  Sum is required for the purposes of this schedule) of Vested Y
Shares  which are or have been acquired by the Buyer for cash, multiplied
by  L0.66 and converted into US$ at the Completion Exchange Rate;   B4 =
the number (as at the relevant date when a calculation of the Total  Sum is

the A  Preference and the amount of the B Preference, and the balance
thereby  obtained shall be the "Ordinary Equity Value";   (b) the Ordinary
Equity Value shall be divided amongst the number of  shares represented by
the Fully Exploded Share Capital, and the result  of that shall be the "Price
per Ordinary Share";   (c) the Price per Ordinary Share shall be divided by
5 and the result of  that shall be the "Price per Y Share"; and   (d) from
the Price per Y Share there shall be deducted the sum of L0.66  (converted
into US$ at the Completion Exchange Rate) and the balance  thereby obtained
shall be the "Net Price per Y Share".  6 A calculation of the Total Sum and
the corresponding Price per Preferred  Share, Price per Ordinary Share and
Price per Y Share shall be performed  on:   (a) the Completion Date;
and   (b) the date which is 3 Business Days after the Drag Along Date;
and   (c) the date which is 3 Business Days after the calculation of the
Net  Cash Adjustment becoming final and binding on the parties in 
accordance with clause 12 of this Agreement,   and in each case, the values
of B1, B2, B3, B4, C and D shall be values of  such items at the relevant
calculation date, and the fully Exploded Share  Capital shall be the entire
issued share capital of the Company on a fully  diluted basis (that is
assuming the exercise of all rights to subscribe  for, or to convert any
security into, shares of any class in the Company,  regardless of whether
they are vested or unvested including shares arising  from exercise of
Options and shares that would have arisen from the  Unvested Options which
have been cancelled and exchanged for Rollover  Options) and dividing the
number of Y Shares by 5.  7 For illustrative purposes only, the following is
a worked example of the  calculation of the Total Sum, the Price per Ordinary
Share, the Price per Y  Share and the Net Price per Y Share:-   Assuming
that and for these purposes, an exchange rate of $1.83: L1.00:   B1 = $8.8m,
B2 = $3.0m, B3 = $1.0m, B4 = $3.6m, C = zero, and D = $10.1m,  and the Fully
Exploded Share Capital is 20.195m shares, then:   Total Sum = A + B1 + B2 +
B3 + B4 + C - D   = $422.5m + $8.8m + $3.0m + $1.0m + $3.6m + zero -
$10.1m   = $428.8m   Ordinary Equity Value = $428.8m - $1.83m -
$31.67m        = $395.3   $395.3m  Price per Ordinary Share =
------- = $19.57  20.195m   $19.57  Price per Y Share = ------ = $3.91 
5   Net Price per Y Share = $3.91 - L0.66 = $3.91 - $1.21 = $2.70  8 For
the purposes of calculating the Total Sum, the Price per Ordinary  Share, the
Price per Y Share and the Net Price per Y Share:   (a) on the Completion
Date, the following assumptions shall be made:   C = zero, D = the amount of
Transaction Costs set out on Appendix 2 or  any other amount agreed for the
purpose between the Buyer and the  Sellers\' Representatives.   Fully
Exploded Share Capital = the number of shares calculated by  reference to the
list delivered to the Buyer pursuant to paragraph  1.1(k) of Part 1 of
Schedule 3 assuming the exercise of all Options  (vested or unvested) and the
sale of all Y Shares (vested or  unvested), including shares arising from
exercise of Options and  shares that would have arisen from the Unvested
Options which have  been cancelled and exchanged for Rollover Options, and
dividing the  number of Y Shares by 5   (b) on the date specified in
paragraph 6(b), the following assumption  shall be made:   C = zero save
that if the Net Cash Adjustment has been determined or  agreed pursuant to
clause 12 of this Agreement prior to such date then  C shall be the amount of
the Net Cash Adjustment; and   (c) on the date specified in paragraph 6(c),
no assumptions shall be made  and all amounts required to perform the
calculations shall be  ascertained unless the actual amount of the
Transaction Costs is  greater or less than the amount agreed between the
Buyer and the  Sellers\' Representatives prior to the Completion Date. If
this is the  case, the actual amount of the Transaction Costs shall be used
when  performing the calculation at this date.  9 The Sellers\'
Representatives shall deliver on or prior to the True Up Date  a certificate
confirming the amount of the actual Transaction Costs and the  extent to
which they are greater or less than the amount agreed between the  Buyer and
the Sellers\' Representatives prior to the Completion Date.  10 The Buyer
shall not be obliged to cause the issue of Restricted Stock to  more than 99
holders of Unvested Y Shares in the United Kingdom, the 99  holders being the
99 individuals in the United Kingdom holding the largest  numbers of Unvested
Y Shares, and the UK Y Shareholder Letter shall for the  purposes of clause
24 be sent only to those holders of Y Shares in the  United Kingdom, with the
UK Y Shareholder Cash Letter being sent to all  other holders of Unvested Y
Shares in the United Kingdom (a "Cash Unvested  Y Shareholder"). A holder of
Unvested Y Shares other than a Cash Unvested Y  Shareholder is referred to in
this Schedule as a Restricted Stock Unvested  Y Shareholder.  11 On Day 40,
the Buyer shall cause the Buyer Parent to satisfy the  cancellation of all
Unvested Options in respect of which an Option  Instruction Form has been
received in exchange for Rollover Options,  regardless of whether or not an
Option Instruction Form electing for such  an exchange is received on or
prior to the Completion Date or following the  Completion Date and on or
before Day 40.       12 On Day 40, the Buyer shall cause the Buyer
Parent to issue Restricted Stock  to Restricted Stock Unvested Y Shareholders
in respect of whose Unvested Y  Shares a Y Shareholder Instruction Form has
been received, regardless of  whether or not such Y Shareholder Instruction
Form is received on or prior  to the Completion Date or following the
Completion Date and on or before  Day 40.  13 Following Day 40, the Buyer
shall pay cash to Cash Unvested Y Shareholders  in accordance with this
Schedule 11 in respect of whose Unvested Y Shares a  Y Shareholder
Instruction Form has been received, regardless of whether or  not such Y
Shareholder Instruction Form is received on or prior to the  Completion Date
or following the Completion Date and on or before Day 40.  14 Where there is
any deduction to be made, which is in any currency other  than US dollars,
then such amount shall be converted into US dollars at the  Completion
Exchange Rate.  15 In the event that the holders of the Unvested Options
which are EMI Options  cease to retain EMI tax favoured status in respect of
their Rollover  Option, then the parties hereby agree that in calculating the
number of  Rollover Options which are to be exchanged for Unvested Options
which are  EMI Options, the exchange ratio shall be adjusted such that the
Unvested  Options which are EMI Options enjoy an aggregate premium of up to 
$1,000,000 in calculating the number of shares to be granted under those 
Rollover Options.       PART 2: SETTLEMENT ON COMPLETION DATE  There
shall be deducted from the amounts paid to Shareholders other than
Y Shareholders in respect of Unvested Y Shares pursuant to this Part 2 of
Schedule 11 all amounts of Taxation, including without limitation income tax,
employee and employer national insurance contributions or other social
security contributions, which arise in connection with the Option exercises,
sale of shares or the exchange of Unvested Options for Rollover Options and
which is listed against the relevant Shareholder\'s or Option Holder\'s name
in the list to be delivered to the Buyer pursuant to paragraph 1.1(k)(iv) or
(viii) or (ix) of Part 1 of Schedule 3.   Selling Shareholders (other than
Sellers of Y Shares)  1 In respect of those shares for which a duly executed
stock transfer form  has been delivered to the Buyer on or prior to the
Completion Date, the  Buyer shall on the Completion Date pay in cash to each
such transferring  Shareholder the Price per Preferred Share or (as the case
may be) Price per  Ordinary Share calculated in accordance with Part 1 of
this Schedule 11,  multiplied by the number of shares comprised in such stock
transfer  form(s), less such Shareholder\'s proportion of the Escrow Amount
and such  Shareholder\'s proportion of the Completion Escrow Account.  2 On
the Completion Date, such a Shareholder\'s proportion of each of the  A 
Escrow Amount and the Completion Escrow Amount is ---, where:  B   A = the
number of shares comprised within the stock transfer form(s)  executed by
such Shareholder   B = the total number of shares in the capital of the
Company acquired by  the Buyer on the Completion Date, but excluding for
these purposes,  55.5% of the Unvested Y Shares acquired by the Buyer on the
Completion  Date and all of the Unvested Options exchanged for Rollover
Options,  and for the avoidance of doubt, treating 5 Y Shares as constituting
1  Share   Shares arising by virtue of exercise of Vested Options  3 In
respect of those shares for which an Optionholder Instruction Letter and  a
duly executed stock transfer form have been delivered to the Buyer on or 
prior to the Completion Date, the Buyer shall on the Completion Date pay in

calculated in accordance with Part 1 of this Schedule 11, multiplied by the 
number of shares comprised in such stock transfer form(s), less:   (a)
unless paid by the Option Holder, the exercise price payable in  respect of
those shares pursuant to the exercise of the relevant  Vested Option; and  
(b) any income tax and employee national insurance or other employee  social
security contributions arising as a result of the exercise of  the relevant
Vested Option as notified within the Notified Withholding  Amount; and  
(c) any employers\' NIC which such shareholder is required to bear the cost 
of and which arises upon the exercise of such Vested Option as  notified

proportion of the Escrow Amount and such  Shareholder\'s proportion of the
Completion Escrow Account calculated  as in paragraph 2 above.   Holders of

executed stock  transfer form has been delivered to the Buyer on or prior to
the Completion  Date, the Buyer shall on the Completion Date       pay
in cash to such transferring Shareholder the Price per Y Share  calculated in
accordance with Part 1 of this Schedule 11, multiplied by the  number of

(converted into US$ at the Completion Exchange Rate) x the  number of Vested
Y Shares comprised in such stock transfer form(s);  and   (b) such
Shareholder\'s proportion of the Escrow Amount and such  Shareholder\'s
proportion of the Completion Escrow Account calculated  as in paragraph 2
above.   Partial Acceleration of Unvested Shares  5 The parties agree that
as regards the Unvested Y Shares the subject of Y  Shareholder Instruction
Forms, 44.5% of the Unvested Y Shares the subject  of such Instructions Forms
shall be regarded as Vested Y Shares and the  Buyer shall satisfy the amount
due in respect of those Unvested Y Shares in  cash in accordance with
paragraph 4 above and the balance shall be treated  in accordance with
paragraph 5 of Part 3.       PART 3: SETTLEMENT ON DAY 40  There shall
be deducted from the amounts paid to Shareholders and holders of Unvested
Options pursuant to this Part 3 of Schedule 11 all amounts of
Taxation, including without limitation income tax, employee and employer
national insurance contributions or other social security contributions,
which arise in connection with the Option exercises, sale of shares or the

the relevant Shareholder\'s or Option Holder\'s name in the list to be
delivered to the Buyer pursuant to paragraph 1.1(k)(iv) or (viii) or (ix) of
Part 1 of Schedule 3.  1 On the date specified in paragraph 6(b) of Part 1

Schedule 11 as the case may be.   Selling Shareholders (other than Sellers
of Y Shares)  2 Those Shareholders who have delivered to the Buyer duly
executed stock  transfer forms in the period starting after Completion and
ending on Day 40  shall receive from the Buyer in cash on Day 40 the Price
per Ordinary Share  calculated as at Day 40 in accordance with Part 1 of this
Schedule 11  multiplied by the number of shares comprised in such stock
transfer forms,  less:   A A  --- multiplied by the Escrow Amount and ---
multiplied by the Completion  B B  Escrow Amount, where   A = the number
of shares comprised within the stock transfer form(s)  executed by such

shall on Day 40 satisfy the amount due in respect of such exchange by 
causing the issue by Buyer Parent of such number of Restricted Stock 
(rounding down in the case of any entitlement to a fractional number), on 
the terms applying to the Unvested Y Shares before the exchange, including 
the relevant provisions of the Articles, as applied by the Buyer as shall 
have a value (calculated in accordance with paragraph 6 below) equal to the 
number of Unvested Y Shares transferred multiplied by the Price per Y Share

Completion Date as quoted on the New  York Stock Exchange.   Holders of
Unvested Options  7 In respect of those Unvested Options for which an Option
Instruction Form  electing to exchange such Unvested Options for Rollover
Options has been  delivered to the Buyer by no later than Day 40, the number

per Ordinary Share multiplied by the number  of shares in the Company which
would have arisen upon exercise of the  Unvested Option in full,      
and where X is equal to the value calculated in accordance with paragraph 6 
above   rounding down in the case of any entitlement to a fractional number
of  Rollover Options, and the exercise price per share comprised within
those  Rollover Options shall be equal to Y/Z   where Y is equal to the

Date plus, their  proportion of the amounts withheld from persons who sold
shares between  Completion and Day 40 in respect of the Escrow Amount. Their
proportion  being the amount that they contributed to the Escrow Account
divided by the  Escrow Amount and their proportion of the amount they
contributed to the  Completion Escrow Account divided by the Completion
Escrow Amount.       PART 4: SETTLEMENT ON THE TRUE UP DATE  1 In
circumstances where the Net Cash Adjustment has not become final and  binding
on the parties in accordance with clause 12 of this Agreement prior  to Day

described in paragraph 6(c) of Part 1 of this Schedule shall  be performed in
order to ascertain the Price per Preferred Share, Price per  Ordinary Share
and Price per Y Share as at the True up Date (in each case a  "True up Date
Price per Share").  2 If the Price per Preferred Share, Price per Ordinary
Share and Price per Y  Share as at the True up Date is greater than the
applicable Day 40 Price  per Share, then the Buyer shall on the True up
Date:   (a) pay in cash to the persons who have transferred shares (other
than  Unvested Y Shares) to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, a 
Shareholder Instruction Form, an Option Instruction Form, the Articles  or

Options an amount equal to the difference between the True up  Date Price per
Share and the Day 40 Price per Share multiplied by the  number of shares so
transferred to the Buyer; and   (b) persons who sold Unvested Y Shares shall
as regards their Unvested Y  Shares be treated in accordance with paragraph
2(a) above as to 44.5%  of their Unvested Y Shares.       PART 5:

shares to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, a Shareholder  Instruction
Form, an Optionholder Instruction Form, the Articles or the New  Articles,
including shares deriving from the exercise of Vested Options and  who have
