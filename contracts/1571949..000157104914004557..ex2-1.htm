of the Company Holders (the "Stockholders' Agent").

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has approved, and deems it advisable
and in the best interests of its stockholders to consummate the merger (the
"Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"), having
carefully considered the interests of the Company and its stockholders and
determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interest of its
stockholders, has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and has resolved to recommend to its
stockholders the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein; and

  

  

WHEREAS, an irrevocable action by written consent by such number of Company
Stockholders sufficient to adopt this Agreement and the Merger and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law") is being
delivered to Parent immediately following the execution of this Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement
and incur the obligations set forth herein, at or prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, (i) the individuals identified on Schedule 1-A
(the "Essential Employees") are accepting and entering into new employment

--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties set forth herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.1. The Merger.

  

  

At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company, as the surviving
corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation."

  

  

Section 1.2. Closing.

  

  

The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.,
Atlanta time, on a date (the "Closing Date"), to be specified by the parties,
which shall occur no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI of
this Agreement (other than the conditions which can be satisfied only on the
Closing Date) at the offices of Greenberg Traurig LLP, 3333 Piedmont Road NE,
Atlanta, Georgia 30305, or such other time, date or place as agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Closing occur prior to October 1, 2014. All deliveries to be made or other
actions to be taken at the Closing shall be deemed to occur simultaneously,
and no such delivery or action shall be deemed complete until all such
deliveries and actions have been completed or the relevant parties have agreed
to waive such delivery or action. If the Closing does not occur, any delivery
made or other action taken at the Closing shall be deemed not to have occurred
and be without force or effect.

  

  

Section 1.3. Effective Time.

  

  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI of this
Agreement the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the "Certificate of Merger") as soon as practicable on the Closing
Date. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to
Delaware Law or at such later time as shall be agreed upon in writing by the
parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"),
which specified time shall be a time on the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 1.4. Effect of the Merger.

  

  

At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at
the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

  

  

At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation, as amended, of the
Company (the "Company Certificate of Incorporation") shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such
certificate of incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time,
Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of
the corporation is Super Derivatives, Inc." At the Effective Time, the bylaws,
as amended, of the Company (the "Company Bylaws") as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in their entirety to
be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law
and as provided in such Company Bylaws.

  

  

Section 1.6. Directors and Officers.

  

  

Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified. Unless otherwise determined by Parent
prior to the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until their respective successors are duly appointed. In addition, unless

Company and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the directors and officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors and
officers, respectively, of each Company Subsidiary immediately after the
Effective Time, each to hold office as a director or officer of each such
Company Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the
respective jurisdiction of organization and the respective bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents of each such Company Subsidiary.

  

  

Section 1.7. Consideration for the Merger.

  

  

(a) The aggregate amount Parent shall pay or cause to be paid (including any
amounts withheld pursuant to Section 1.15) to the (i) holders of shares of
Company Capital Stock (the "Company Stockholders") and (ii) holders of Vested
Company Options and all other equity interests of the Company (collectively,
together with the Company Stockholders, the "Company Holders" and each, a
"Company Holder") in exchange for the acquisition by Parent of all shares of
Company Capital Stock, the cancellation, termination, or conversion, as
applicable, of Vested Company Options and other similar rights to acquire
Company Capital Stock or other equity securities of the Company (whether
vested, unvested, earned, unearned or contingent) (the "Merger Consideration")
shall be an amount equal to Three Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars
($350,000,000), as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.7(b) below. The Merger
Consideration shall consist of:

  

  

(i) an amount (the "Initial Amount"), which shall be deposited in cash with
the Paying Agent at Closing in accordance with Section 1.11(b), equal to the
remainder of (x) the Merger Consideration, minus (y) the sum of the (I) Escrow
Amount, and (II) the Expense Amount;

  

   

3 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(ii) an amount equal to Forty Three Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($43,750,000) in cash (the "Escrow Amount"), which shall be deposited
in cash with the Escrow Agent at Closing pursuant to Section 8.1 and;

  

  

(iii) an amount equal to Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the
"Expense Amount"), which shall be deposited in cash with the Escrow Agent at
Closing pursuant to Section 8.5(c).

  

  

(b) The Merger Consideration is subject to the following adjustments:

  

  

(i) The Merger Consideration shall be increased by the aggregate amount of any
Estimated Closing Cash;

  

  

(ii) The Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any
Closing Indebtedness;

  

  

(iii) The Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any
unpaid Company Fees and Expenses as of the Effective Time; and

  

  

(iv) The Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of any Closing
Negative Adjustment or increased by the amount of any Closing Positive
Adjustment.

  

  

Section 1.8. Net Working Capital Adjustment.

  

  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term "Net Working Capital" means
total Current Assets less total Current Liabilities, except that Company Cash
shall be excluded from Current Assets and Company Fees and Expenses and
Indebtedness shall be excluded from Current Liabilities; (ii) the term
"Estimated Net Working Capital" shall mean the estimated amount of Net Working
Capital as determined pursuant to subsection (b) below; (iii) the term
"Estimated Net Working Capital Deficit" shall mean the amount, if any, by
which Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working
Capital; (iv) the term "Estimated Net Working Capital Surplus" shall mean the
amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the
Target Net Working Capital; and (v) the term "Estimated Closing Cash" shall
mean the estimated amount of Company Cash as of the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a statement of Estimated Net Working Capital,
as of the Effective Time (the "Statement of Estimated Net Working Capital").
The Statement of Estimated Net Working Capital shall be determined in
accordance with the definition of "Net Working Capital" set forth in this
Agreement, and shall include the line items and otherwise be in the form of
Exhibit F to this Agreement, and include a computation of the Estimated Net
Working Capital Deficit, if any, or the Estimated Net Working Capital Surplus,
if any.

  

   

4 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(c) If there is an Estimated Net Working Capital Deficit, then the Initial
Amount shall be adjusted downward by the absolute value of the amount of such
difference (the "Closing Negative Adjustment"). If there is an Estimated Net
Working Capital Surplus, then the Initial Amount shall be adjusted upward by
an amount equal to the absolute value of the amount of such difference (the
"Closing Positive Adjustment").

  

  

(d) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Stockholders' Agent a proposed statement of Closing Cash and
Net Working Capital of the Company as of the Effective Time (the "Proposed
Statement of Net Working Capital"). The Proposed Statement of Net Working
Capital shall include all of the line items included in the computation of
Estimated Net Working Capital and shall include a computation of Net Working
Capital.

  

  

(e) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the Stockholders'
Agent's receipt of the Proposed Statement of Net Working Capital (the
"Proposed Statement Review Period"), the Stockholders' Agent will be permitted
to make commercially reasonable inquiries of Parent and its employees,
accountants and representatives regarding questions concerning the Proposed
Statement of Net Working Capital, provided that all such inquiries shall be
coordinated through Parent's accounting department.

  

  

(f) The Stockholders' Agent shall notify Parent in writing (the "Notice of Net
Working Capital Disagreement") prior to the expiration of the Proposed
Statement Review Period if the Stockholders' Agent disagrees with any one or
more of the line items of the Proposed Statement of Net Working Capital. The
Notice of Net Working Capital Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such dispute, the amounts involved and the Stockholders'
Agent's determination of the amount of the Net Working Capital of the Company
as of the Effective Time. If no Notice of Net Working Capital Disagreement is
given to Parent prior to the expiration of the Proposed Statement Review
Period, then the Proposed Statement of Net Working Capital shall be deemed to
have been accepted by the Stockholders' Agent and shall become final, binding
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement.

  

  

(g) If a Notice of Net Working Capital Disagreement is given to Parent prior
to the expiration of the Proposed Statement Review Period, then the
Stockholders' Agent and Parent shall, within ten (10) Business Days after
delivery of such Notice of Net Working Capital Disagreement, attempt, in good
faith, to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Net Working Capital Disagreement.

--- 

   



    

  

(h) If the Stockholders' Agent and Parent have been unable to resolve all of
the differences they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Net Working Capital Disagreement within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the delivery of the Notice of Net Working Capital Disagreement, either
the Stockholders' Agent or Parent may submit all matters that remain in
dispute with respect to the Notice of Net Working Capital Disagreement (along
with a copy of the Proposed Statement of Net Working Capital marked to
indicate those line items that are not in dispute) to the office of an
independent public accounting firm mutually agreed by the parties (the
"Accounting Arbitrator"). Each party agrees to execute a reasonable engagement
letter if requested by the Accounting Arbitrator. During the review by the
Accounting Arbitrator, Parent and the Stockholders' Agent will make available
to the Accounting Arbitrator such information as may be reasonably required by
the Accounting Arbitrator to fulfill the Accounting Arbitrator's obligations
under this Section 1.8.

  

  

(i) The Accounting Arbitrator shall be instructed to make a final
determination, binding on the parties to this Agreement, of the appropriate
amount of each of the line items in the Proposed Statement of Net Working
Capital as to which the Stockholders' Agent and Parent disagree as set out in
the Notice of Net Working Capital Disagreement within thirty (30) days after
the submission of matters in dispute to the Accounting Arbitrator, or as soon
as practicable thereafter. Such determination shall be in accordance with the
standards set forth in this section and shall be final, binding and conclusive
with respect to any issue relating to Parent's compliance with the standards
set forth in this Section 1.8 in preparing the Proposed Statement of Net
Working Capital.

  

  

(j) The statement of Net Working Capital of the Company and the determination
of the Net Working Capital of the Company, as determined either through the
expiration of the Proposed Statement Review Period without a Notice of Net
Working Capital Disagreement delivered to Parent, through an agreement of
Parent and the Stockholders' Agent or through the action of the Accounting
Arbitrator pursuant to this Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive
on the parties, and shall be referred to as the "Final Statement of Net
Working Capital" and the "Final Net Working Capital," respectively.

  

  

(k) Final Net Working Capital and Closing Cash Payments.

  

  

(i) If there was a Closing Negative Adjustment then, within five (5) Business
Days after the Final Statement of Net Working Capital has been determined, the
parties shall do as follows:

  

  

(A) If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, then the amount by which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds
the Final Net Working Capital shall be disbursed to Parent by the Escrow Agent
from the Escrow Amount;

  

  

(B) If the Final Net Working Capital is equal to the Estimated Net Working
Capital, then no amount shall be paid pursuant to this Section 1.8;

  

  

(C) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, but less than the Target Net Working Capital, then Parent shall pay
the Company Holders in the same manner as was paid to them on the Closing Date
(pursuant to each such holder's pro-rata share as reflected on the Final
Allocation Schedule) an amount equal to the amount by which the Final Net
Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital; or

  

   

6 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(D) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working
Capital, then Parent shall pay the Company Holders (pursuant to such holder's
pro-rata share as reflected on the Final Allocation Schedule) an amount equal
to (I) the Closing Negative Adjustment plus (II) the amount by which the Final
Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital.

  

  

(ii) If there was neither a Closing Negative Adjustment nor a Closing Positive
Adjustment, then, within five (5) Business Days after the Final Statement of
Net Working Capital has been determined, the parties shall do as follows:

  

  

(A) If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working
Capital, then the amount by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the
Final Net Working Capital shall be disbursed to Parent by the Escrow Agent
from the Escrow Amount;

  

  

(B) If the Final Net Working Capital is equal to the Target Working Capital,
then no amount shall be paid pursuant to this Section 1.8; or

  

  

(C) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working
Capital, then Parent shall pay the Company Holders (pursuant to such holder's
pro-rata share as reflected on the Final Allocation Schedule) an amount equal
to the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net
Working Capital.

  

  

(iii) If there was a Closing Positive Adjustment, then, within five (5)
Business Days after the Final Statement of Net Working Capital has been
determined, the parties shall do as follows:

  

  

(A) If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working
Capital, then the amount by which (x) the Target Net Working Capital exceeds
the Final Net Working Capital plus (y) the Closing Positive Adjustment, shall
be disbursed to Parent by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Amount;

  

  

(B) If the Final Net Working Capital is equal to the Estimated Net Working
Capital, then no amount shall be paid pursuant to this Section 1.8;

  

  

(C) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working
Capital, but less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the amount by

shall automatically be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares of common

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (i) of this Section 1.9(c), if
any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such
holder's shares of Company Capital Stock under Delaware Law effectively
withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder's
right to appraisal, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, whichever later occurs, such holder's shares of Company Capital Stock
shall automatically be converted into the right to receive cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to the applicable amount set forth on the Final
Allocation Schedule, without interest, subject to any escrow, adjustment,

Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served on the Company pursuant to Delaware Law or relating to the Merger, and
(y) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to

(b) Vested Company Options; 102 Shares. Each outstanding Company Option that
is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that is vested and exercisable (including all Unvested Company
Options that have become vested and exercisable in accordance with Section
1.10(a) and including all such unexpired, unexercised and outstanding Company
Options that by their terms accelerate at Closing (each a "Vested Company
Option")), shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time in
exchange for a cash payment (without interest and subject to Section 1.15)
from Parent equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock with respect to which such Vested Company Option is vested and
exercisable as of immediately before the Effective Time, multiplied by the
excess, if any, of (1) the Per Common Share Pro-Rata Merger Consideration,
less (2) the per share exercise price applicable to such Vested Company
Option, plus (ii) the Aggregate Exercise Proceeds Proportional Share. As of
the Effective Time the Vested Company Options shall cease to be outstanding
and each holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive cash with respect thereto in accordance with this
Section 1.10(b), and each Vested Company Option shall be of no further force
and effect. Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(b) with respect
to Vested Company Options and 102 Shares, if any, held by current or former
officers, employees or consultants of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
shall be paid to the holder of such Company Options as soon as
administratively practicable after the Effective Time, except that such
amounts with respect to Company 102 Options or 102 Shares, if any, that are
held by the 102 Trustee ("102 Cash Consideration"), shall be paid to the 102
Trustee, who shall make such payments in accordance with the Israeli Options
Tax Ruling, and the Israeli Tax Ordinance; provided, however, that in the
event that neither the interim nor final Israeli Options Tax Ruling has been
obtained prior to the Closing, the Parties agree that the deposit of the 102
Cash Consideration payable in accordance with the provisions of this Section
1.10(b) shall be delayed by the Paying Agent until the earlier of (i) the
receipt of the Interim Option Ruling or Israeli Options Tax Ruling or (ii) the
15th day of the calendar month following the month during which the Effective
Time occurred. The Company shall take commercially reasonable steps prior to
the Effective Time to cause Company Options granted to employees and
consultants of the U.K. Company Subsidiary to be exercised on a cashless basis
immediately prior to the Closing to cause them to be treated in accordance
with relevant Tax considerations.

  

  

(c) The Company shall take all steps necessary prior to the Effective Time to
cause the Company Options to be treated as set forth in this Section 1.10,
including providing any necessary notices and obtaining any necessary consents
or waivers. Copies of the relevant agreements governing all Company Options
have been provided to Parent. A form of letter of transmittal to be used in
effecting the surrender of the Company Options for payment in accordance with
this Section 1.10 is attached hereto as Exhibit E-2.

  

  

(d) The Company shall take all steps necessary prior to the Effective Time to
terminate the Company Stock Plan, effective as of the Effective Time, so that
such Company Stock Plan shall no longer have any force or effect.

selected by Parent with the reasonable consent of the Company) shall act as
paying agent (the "Paying Agent") in the Merger, in accordance with an
agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B to this Agreement.

(b) Parent to Provide Cash. Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to the Paying Agent for exchange and payment in accordance with this
ARTICLE I an aggregate amount of cash equal to the Initial Amount as set forth
on the Final Allocation Schedule. In the case of payments to employees or
former employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Company
Options, such payments may be made through the Company's, any Company
Subsidiary's or Parent's payroll processing service or system within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date, to the extent administratively
practicable, or, if not practicable, the next regular payroll cycle of the
Company, Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

  

  

(c) Exchange Procedures. On the Closing Date (or at such later date when a
holder of record of a certificate or certificates representing Company Capital
Stock (each such certificate, a "Company Certificate"), whose Company Capital
Stock is to be converted into the right to receive a portion of the Initial
Amount, surrenders his or her Company Certificates, along with a letter of
transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in
exchange for the Initial Amount each substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit E-1 (the "Letter of Transmittal")), upon surrender of all Company
Certificates held by a Company Holder for cancellation to the Paying Agent or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with
such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the Company Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled and, subject to Section 1.15, the holder of such
Company Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor payment
of cash by the Paying Agent in an amount equal to applicable cash amount set
forth on the Final Allocation Schedule. Payments by the Paying Agent shall be
promptly made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
of such Company Holder and provided in writing to the Paying Agent by such
Company Holder. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Company Certificate
that, prior to the Effective Time, represented Company Capital Stock will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence solely
the right to receive a portion of the Initial Amount in accordance with this
ARTICLE I. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any 102 Cash
Consideration to be paid shall be paid directly to the 102 Trustee to be held
in trust and released in accordance with the terms of the Company's agreement
with the 102 Trustee, applicable Legal Requirement (including, where
applicable, the completion of any required 102 Trust Period) and the terms of
the Israeli Options Tax Ruling (or any interim Israeli Options Tax Ruling) or
any other approval from the Israeli Tax Authority granted to the Company or
Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

it, any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment in cash to any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Company Certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent

Section 1.12. No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock; No
Interest.

  

  

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of any
shares of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company. From and after

except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.
If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to Parent or

Section 1.15. Tax Withholding.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent,
the Paying Agent (which for purposes of this Agreement shall include any
Israeli or other local agent engaged by the Paying agent to process
withholding tax payments) and the 102 Trustee, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld) from the
Merger Consideration payable hereunder to any Company Holder, or other payment
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code,
the Israeli Tax Ordinance (including any rules and regulations thereunder) or
any provision of any U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Legal Requirement;
provided, however, that no withholding will be made under Israeli law upon the
transfer of the Merger Consideration to the Paying Agent and that the Person
intending to withhold pursuant to any provision of U.S. federal, state, or
local Law shall notify the Stockholders' Agent that it intends to deduct and
withhold at least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date or any
subsequent date on which the applicable payment is to be made pursuant to this
Agreement in order to provide any Company Holder with sufficient opportunity
to provide any forms or other documentation or take any such other steps in
order to properly avoid such withholding (the "10-Day Notice Procedure").
Withholding pursuant to other provisions of Tax Laws will be as set forth
below. To the extent that amounts are properly withheld in accordance with
this Section 1.15(a), the amounts so deducted or withheld shall be timely
remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent,
the 102 Trustee or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, to the appropriate
Governmental Entity and shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid
to such Company Holder in respect of whom such deduction or withholding and
remittance to the appropriate Governmental Entity was made. In the case of any
amounts withheld, the withholding party shall promptly provide to the Company
Holder from which such amounts were withheld written confirmation of the
amount so withheld. No U.S. federal, state or local Tax withholding shall be
required with respect to payments to Company Stockholders or any other payee
of a payment pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, other than
with respect to compensatory options, compensation payments, or as otherwise
required by Law (including, without limitation, the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act ("FATCA")), in accordance with the 10-Day Notice Procedure,
provided that such holders provide properly completed and valid IRS Form W-9
or Form W-8 (or any successor forms), as applicable, and the Company provides
the FIRPTA Certificate described in Section 5.8. To the extent that any
payment pursuant to this Agreement is not reduced by any deduction or
withholding, and such lack of reduction is not attributable to the negligence
of Parent, its affiliates (including the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
and any Company Subsidiaries), or their agents, the recipient of any amounts
that should have been deducted or withheld under applicable Law shall
indemnify Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) for
any such amounts required to be paid to any Tax Authority, together with any
costs and expenses related thereto (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs of investigation); provided, however, that in no event shall such
recipient be required to indemnify Parent and its affiliates for (i) Taxes of
any other Person; (ii) the portion of any costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of investigation) properly attributable
to any other Person; and (iii) any amounts in excess of the amount received by
such recipient that was the subject of such lack of reduction for deduction or
withholding (the "Recipient Withholding Tax Indemnity"). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, other than with respect to compensatory
options, compensation payments, or as otherwise required by Law (including,
without limitation, FATCA), in accordance with the 10-Day Notice Procedure,
none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent and
the Paying Agent, or anyone acting on their behalf, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to or in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to any
Company Holder or other payee for U.S. federal, state or local Tax purposes
unless (A) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, has not received from such Person a
completed IRS Form W-8 or Form W-9 (or any successor form), as applicable, or
the FIRPTA Certificate described in Section 5.8, and (B) Parent, Paying Agent,
the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent or the Company have previously
given written notice of such potential withholding to the Company Holders or
other payee and the Company Holders or other payee have had a reasonable
opportunity to provide the IRS Form W-8 or Form W-9, as applicable. With
respect to any amount to be deducted or withheld under the Israeli Tax
Ordinance pursuant to this Section 1.15(a), the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration payable to each of the Company Holders which are subject
to deduction or withholding, shall be paid by Parent to the Paying Agent
without any withholding and retained by the Paying Agent for the benefit of
each such Company Holders for a period of 180 (one hundred eighty) days from
Closing or an earlier date requested in writing by a Company Holder in respect
of its applicable portion of the Merger Consideration (the "Withholding
Deadline") during which time none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Israeli Subsidiary, the Escrow Agent, or the Paying Agent
shall withhold any Israeli Tax on such consideration, except as provided
below, and during which time each of said Company Holders may seek to obtain:
(i) a valid ruling or certificate issued by the Israeli Tax Authority
regarding the deduction or withholding of Tax (including the reduction of Tax
to be withheld, an exemption from withholding or any other instructions
regarding the payment of withholding including extensions) and including a
ruling allowing the transfer of the withholding Tax amount to a trustee from
any consideration payable to such payee hereunder provided sufficient amount
is held in trust to cover the withholding requirement, or (ii) a valid
certificate issued by the Israeli Tax Authority pursuant to the Israeli Income
Tax Regulations (Withholding from Payments for Services or Assets), 5737 -
1977, not specifically referring to the transaction hereunder (the ruling or
certificate referred to in sub-sections (i) and (ii) above, the "Israeli Tax
Certificate"). In the event that no later than seven (7) calendar days before
the Withholding Deadline, a Company Holder submits an Israeli Tax Certificate,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent or the Paying Agent upon
the advice of Parent's tax advisor, the Paying Agent shall withhold and
transfer to the Israeli Tax Authority such amount of withholding (if any) due
from such Company Holder as specified in such Israeli Tax Certificate, and
shall pay to such Company Holder only the balance of the payment due to such
Company Holder that is not so withheld and shall otherwise act in accordance
with such Israeli Tax Certificate. If any Company Holder (A) does not provide
the Paying Agent with such Israeli Tax Certificate by the seventh (7) day
before the Withholding Deadline, or (B) requests from the Paying Agent in
writing to release its portion of the Merger Consideration prior to the
Withholding Deadline and fails to submit an Israeli Tax Certificate at or
before such time, then the amount to be withheld from such Company Holder's
portion of the Merger Consideration (or, if any applicable Israeli Tax Rulings
so provides, only with respect to the portion of the Merger Consideration
actually being paid to such Company Holder) shall be calculated according to
the applicable withholding rate (plus applicable Israeli Consumer Price Index
linkage differences, interest as set forth in section 159A of the Israeli Tax
Ordinance (currently, 4% annually) and calculated in NIS based on a US$:NIS
exchange rate not lower than the rate on the Closing Date) (the "Applicable
Exchange Rate") as reasonably determined by Parent or the Paying Agent after
receipt of advice of Parent's tax advisors and in accordance with the
respective tax ruling. Such amount shall be timely delivered to the Israeli
Tax Authority by the Paying Agent, and Paying Agent shall deliver such Company
Holder the Payment Confirmation and pay to such Company Holder the balance of
the payment due to such Company Holder that is not so withheld. For the
avoidance of doubt, if an Israeli Tax Certificate is provided and such
certificate does not expressly refer to the entire Company Holder's portion of
the Merger Consideration, no withholding shall be made with respect to such
Company Holder's portion of (i) the Escrow Amount and (ii) the Expense Amount.
If however an Israeli Tax Certificate is not provided, and unless the Israeli
Tax Rulings expressly provide otherwise, the applicable amount to be withheld
from such Company Stockholder's portion of the Merger Consideration deposited
with the Paying Agent will be calculated (as provided above) also on such
Company Stockholder's portion of the Escrow Amount and such Company
Stockholder's portion of the Expense Amount and will be deducted and delivered
to the Israel Tax Authority by the Paying Agent as provided above. To the
extent the Israeli Tax Rulings determine that the Escrow Fund distributions
and any distribution of Expense Amount, if any, to each Company Stockholder,
shall be subject to Israeli Tax only upon actual receipt by the applicable
Company Stockholder, or if such withholding is otherwise to be made only upon
actual receipt by the applicable Company Holder pursuant to this Section, the
transfer of such funds to such Company Stockholder shall be subject to
withholding and the provision of this Section shall apply, mutatis mutandis.

(b) The provisions of Section 1.15(a) above shall not apply to payments made
to holders of Company Options and/or Company 102 Shares and/or Company Options
subject to Israeli Tax pursuant to Section 3(i) of the Israeli Tax Ordinance,
who are subject to Israeli Tax Ordinance, in respect of which applicable
amounts will be deducted or withheld under the Israeli Tax Ordinance, unless,
with respect to Israeli resident holders of Company Options or Company 102
Shares addressed in the Israeli Options Tax Ruling (or any Interim Option
Ruling), the Israeli Options Tax Ruling (or any Interim Option Ruling) shall
have been obtained before the 15th of the calendar month following the month
during which Closing occurs, and which ruling provides that Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent, and the Paying Agent and
anyone acting on their behalf shall be exempt from Israeli withholding tax
with respect to any of the payments made pursuant to this Agreement to the 102
Trustee or the Paying Agent, as applicable, and further instructing the 102
Trustee or the Paying Agent, as applicable, on the withholding of Israeli tax
on such payments.

  

  

(c) Any withholding made in New Israeli Shekels with respect to payments made
hereunder in dollars shall be calculated based on the Applicable Exchange Rate
and in such manner as the Parent reasonably determines to be in compliance
with the applicable Legal Requirement and any currency conversion commissions
will be borne by the applicable payment recipient and deducted from payments
to be made to such payment recipient.

(d) With respect to non-Israeli resident holders of Company Options or of
shares deriving from the exercise of Company Options, which were granted such
awards in consideration for work or services performed outside of the United
States and Israel, such payments shall not be subject to any withholding or
deduction of United States or Israeli Tax, but shall be subject to the Legal
Requirements of their jurisdiction of residency, including in respect of any
withholding or deduction of Taxes, provided that in respect of Israeli
withholding, a declaration in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent has
been provided regarding their non-Israeli residence and confirmation that they
were granted such awards in consideration for work or services performed
outside of Israel has been provided to Parent according to the form included
in the letter of transmittal attached as Exhibit E.

  

  

Section 1.16. Israeli Tax Rulings.

  

  

(a) Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company has instructed its
Israeli tax advisor, in consultation with Parent and its counsel, advisors
and/or accountants to prepare and file with the Israeli Tax Authority one or
more applications seeking, inter alia, confirmation that:

  

  

(i) the deposit with the 102 Trustee of the portion of any payments to be paid
to holders of Company 102 Shares, if any, and Company 102 Options, which are
subject to the statutory holding period under Section 102 of the Israeli Tax
Ordinance, will not result in a requirement for an immediate Israeli Tax
payment (or withholding by Parent or the Surviving Corporation), and that the
statutory holding period applied with respect to Company 102 Shares and
Company 102 Options will continue uninterrupted from the original date of
grant and will not recommence as a result of the transactions contemplated
herein, provided that the respective portion of the Initial Amount paid to
such holders of Company 102 Options and Company 102 Shares is deposited with
the 102 Trustee for the remainder of the duration of the statutory holding
period;

  

  

(ii) Parent, the Company and anyone acting on their behalf (including the
Paying Agent) shall be exempt from withholding tax in relation to any payments
made to the Section 102 Trustee in relation to the Company 102 Options and
Company 102 Shares, if any; the confirmations included in this sub-section
(ii) and in sub-section (i) above, collectively, and additional confirmations
included in such ruling the "Israeli Options Tax Ruling;"

  

  

(iii) such other ruling or relief as the parties shall agree is appropriate to
request under the circumstances (all such rulings may be subject to customary
conditions regularly associated with such a ruling) (collectively with the
Israeli Options Tax Ruling, the "Israeli Tax Rulings").

  

  

(b) If the Israeli Options Tax Ruling is not granted prior to Closing, the
Company shall seek to receive prior to the Closing an interim tax ruling(s)
confirming, among other things, that (i) Parent and anyone acting on its
behalf shall be exempt from Israeli withholding tax in relation to any
payments made to the 102 Trustee (the "Interim Option Ruling") and all
references herein to the Israeli Options Tax Ruling shall be deemed to refer
to the Interim Option Ruling, until such time that a final definitive Israeli
Options Tax Ruling is obtained.

(c) The parties hereto understand and acknowledge that the Israeli Tax Rulings
may not be obtained (provided however that the Interim Option Ruling will be
obtained prior to Closing) or may contain such provisions, terms and
conditions as the Israeli Tax authority may prescribe, which may be different
from those detailed in this Agreement. The parties further understand and
acknowledge that the benefits to holders contemplated in this Agreement may
not be granted, or may not be granted in full. The parties agree that in the
event that the Israeli Tax Rulings are not obtained, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Israeli Subsidiary, the Paying Agent, the 102 Trustee and the
Escrow Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to withhold any amount as
may be required under applicable Tax, the Interim Option Ruling and in
accordance with this Agreement. Whereas in the event that the Israeli Tax
Authority prescribes provisions, terms or conditions that differ from those
detailed above, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Israeli Subsidiary, the
Paying Agent, the 102 Trustee or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, shall
act in accordance with the provision, terms and conditions of the Israeli Tax
Rulings.

  

  

(d) Subject to the provisions of Section 1.16(a) above, the Stockholders'
Agent shall, and shall instruct its representatives and advisors to, cooperate
with Parent and its Israeli tax advisor, representatives and advisors with
respect to the preparation and filing of such applications and in the
preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper
or advisable to obtain the Israeli Options Tax Ruling and any Israeli Tax
Rulings to the extent applicable. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Legal Requirements to obtain the Israeli Options
Tax Ruling and any Israeli Tax Rulings, as promptly as practicable. In any
event, the final text of the requests to obtain the Israeli Options Tax Ruling
and any Israeli Tax Rulings and the actual the Israeli Options Tax Ruling and
any Israeli Tax Rulings, to the extent drafted or amended by any of the
parties or their professional advisors shall in all circumstances be subject
to the prior written consent of Parent and the Stockholders' Agent on behalf
of the Company Holders, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

  

  

Section 1.17. Transfer Taxes.

  

  

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, value added, stamp, registration and
such other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes" ) imposed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be split equally between Parent, on the
one hand, and the Company Holders, on the other. The parties shall cooperate
in good faith in preparing and filing all Tax Returns or other applicable
documents in connection with Transfer Taxes and to apply for and establish
exemptions from or otherwise reduce Transfer Taxes.

Except as set forth in the schedule prepared by the Company and delivered to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure

and warranties made only as a specific date) as follows:

  

  

Section 2.1. Organization, Standing and Power.

standing under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease, license and use its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted and
is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and, in jurisdictions
where such concept is recognized, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the ownership, leasing, licensing or use of its assets and properties,
or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such qualification, licensing
or admission necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company. Section 2.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth each jurisdiction where the Company is so
qualified, licensed or admitted to do business. The Company has made available
to Parent a complete and correct copy of its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, as amended to date. The Company is not in violation of any of the
provisions of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or Fourth Amended and
Restated Shareholders Agreement.

jurisdictions where such concept is recognized, in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Section 2.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists each entity that is a Company Subsidiary and sets
forth the percentage ownership by the Company of such Company Subsidiary. Each
Company Subsidiary has the requisite corporate power to own its properties and
to carry on its business as now being conducted and is duly qualified to do
business and, in jurisdictions where such concept is recognized, is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, leasing, licensing or
use of its assets and properties, or the conduct or nature of its business,
makes such qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified and in good standing , individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to such Company
Subsidiary. The Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete
copy of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing
documents) of each Company Subsidiary, each as amended to date. None of the
Company Subsidiaries is in violation of the provisions of its governing
documents. Except for the Company Subsidiaries disclosed in Section 2.1(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not directly or indirectly
own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible or
exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any Person.
All the outstanding capital stock of each Company Subsidiary is owned directly
or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all Liens and all claims or
charges of any kind, and is validly issued, fully paid up and nonassessable.

contribution or otherwise) in any other entity.

  

  

(e) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Company is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock of the
Company. Following the Effective Time, no Person will have any right to
receive capital stock of the Surviving Corporation upon exercise, conversion
or vesting of any Company Option, Voting Debt or any other right or
convertible instrument. Except as set forth in Section 2.2(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the outstanding Company Options permit any
accelerated vesting or exercisability of those options, shares of restricted
stock or warrants by reason of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any
acceleration of vesting in connection with any termination of employment with
the Company prior to the Effective Time or with the Surviving Corporation

complete and correct list as of the date hereof of each holder of record of
Company Capital Stock and their respective, last-known addresses (if and as

or not an employee of the Company, the number and class of such securities
owned by each such holder and the respective certificate numbers.

(g) Section 2.2(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list as of the date hereof of all holders of record of unexpired
Company Options, including for each Company Option award (i) the name of each
such holder and his or her last-known address and taxpayer identification
number (in each case, if and as reflected in the Company's records), (ii) the
class and number of shares of Company Capital Stock subject to each Company
Option, (iii) the exercise or vesting schedule, as applicable, including the
extent vested to date, (iv) if applicable, the exercise price per share, (v)
the date of grant, (vi) the expiration date, (vii) whether such Company Option
award is held by a Person who is not an employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, and (viii) whether such Company Option was granted and is
subject to Israeli Tax pursuant to Section 3(i) or Section 102 of the Israeli
Tax Ordinance and the applicable sub-section of Section 102, and for Company
Options subject to Section 102(b)(2) of the Israeli Tax Ordinance the date of
deposit of such Company Option with the 102 Trustee, including with respect to
grants prior to July 24, 2012 the date of deposit of the applicable terms of
grant with the 102 Trustee and with respect to grants following July 24, 2012
the date of deposit of the applicable board or committee resolution and the
date of deposit of the option agreement with the 102 Trustee. No Company
Options have been exercised as of the date of this Agreement and all Company
Options granted prior to the date of this Agreement to U.S. taxpayers were
nonqualified stock options. Except as set forth in Section 2.2(g) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and as provided in ARTICLE I of this Agreement,
there are no commitments or agreements of any character to which the Company
is bound obligating the Company to accelerate the vesting or exercisability of
any Company Option award as a result of the Merger (whether alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events). Each grant of Company
Options was validly issued and properly approved by the Board of Directors of
the Company (or a duly authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements and recorded on the
Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP, and no such grants involved any
"back dating," "forward dating" or similar practices with respect to the
effective date of grant. No Company Option has an exercise price that is or
has been less than the fair market value of the Common Stock as of the date
such Company Option was granted or has any feature for the deferral of
compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later
of exercise or disposition of such option, in each case, determined in
accordance with the regulations and guidance under Code Section 409A. The
Company has made available to Parent prior to the date hereof, true and
correct copies of all Code Section 409A valuation reports with respect to the
valuation of the fair market value of Common Stock since January 1, 2009, for
purposes of determining the exercise price of Company Options. As of the
Effective Time, no holder or former holder of Company Options, or with respect
to Company 102 Options the beneficiary thereof, will have any right to
receive, except as provided in ARTICLE I, shares of capital stock or other
securities of Parent or any cash payment from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in each case in respect of Company Options.

the Company Stock Plan and all forms of award agreements evidencing awards
granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan as of the date hereof. Except as
set forth in Section 2.2(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no award
agreements evidencing awards granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan differ
materially from such forms in connection with any award. No outstanding stock
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
phantom stock, profit participation, performance shares or other equity-based
awards associated with shares of Company Common Stock have been issued or are
outstanding other than pursuant to the Company Stock Plan and other than as
set forth on Section 2.2(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The terms of
the Company Stock Plan and all forms of award agreements evidencing awards
granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan permit the treatment of the Company
Options as set forth in Section 1.10, without the consent or approval of the
holders of such Company Options or the parties to such award agreements,
holders of the Company Capital Stock or any other Person.

  

  

(i) Section 2.2(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of all Indebtedness of the Company and any Company
Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement. No Indebtedness of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary contains any restriction upon (i) the prepayment of any
of such Indebtedness, (ii) the incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, or (iii) the ability of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to grant any Lien on its properties or assets.

  

  

(j) The Final Allocation Schedule, when delivered, will be true and correct in
all respects and, upon payment of the amounts set forth therein, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will have any obligations to the Company Holders with respect to
the Company Capital Stock or Company Options, as the case may be.

Section 2.3. Authority. The Company has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other agreements set
forth in the exhibits hereto (collectively, the "Ancillary Agreements") to

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and (other than the
aforementioned approval of the Company Holders and adoption and filing of the
appropriate merger documents and any actions required pursuant to this
Agreement) no other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary
to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, the performance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement to which the Company is a party have been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto, each constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the
Company in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by the effect, if any, of (i) any applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Legal Requirements
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and (ii) general
principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity. Neither the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will conflict with, or result
in any breach or violation of, or default under (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or obligation or loss of any benefit under or with respect to (A) any
provision of the Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws,
or other equivalent charter documents of any Company Subsidiary, (B) assuming
the consents, waivers and approvals set forth in Section 6.3(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule are duly obtained, any Company Material Contract (C)
subject to the exceptions set forth in (i) through (v) in the sentence that
immediately follows, any Legal Requirement currently applicable to the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or
assets (whether tangible or intangible), except, in the case of clauses (B)
and (C) above, any such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults, rights or
losses, which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company. Except for (i) the filing and
recordation of the Certificate of Merger and the related certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the requirements
of Delaware Law, (ii) such filings as may be required under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), (iii)

which, if not made or obtained, would not be reasonably likely to be material
to the Company, no notice to, filing with, and no permit, authorization,
consent or approval of, any arbitrator, court, nation, government, any state
or other political subdivision thereof and any entity exercising executive,
legislative, judicial, regulatory, taxing or administrative functions of, or
pertaining to, government (a "Governmental Entity"), or any private third
party pursuant to a Company Material Contract is necessary for the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.4. Financial Statements. Attached hereto as Section 2.4 of the

schedules thereto, if any) (i) have been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), consistently
applied; and (ii) present fairly in all material respects the consolidated

basis. Since January 1, 2014, there has been no change in any accounting
policies, principles, methods or practices, including any change with respect
to reserves (whether for bad debts, contingent liabilities or otherwise), of
the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, no audit firm has ever declined

(g) Development and Assignment of Company Intellectual Property. The Company

with the Company assigning all right, title and interest in any Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Rights developed by said founder, partner,
shareholder, director, officer, employee, consultant or contractor while
working within his or her employment at the time of such development, to the
Company or an appropriate Company Subsidiary, expressly waiving any rights
under applicable Legal Requirements for compensation or royalties in

Property Rights and providing reasonable protection for the confidential
information of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (an "IP Assignment and
Confidentiality Agreement"), and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no party to
any such agreement is in breach thereof. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is obligated to pay royalties, fees or other similar compensation
(other than, with respect to current employees or employees on termination

current or former employee, founder, officer or Independent Contractor in
connection with any Company Intellectual Property. To the extent the Company
or any Company Subsidiary has acquired ownership of any Intellectual Property
or Intellectual Property Rights from any Person not subject to an IP
Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement, the Company or Company Subsidiary,
as applicable, has obtained a valid and enforceable assignment sufficient to
irrevocably transfer all transferable rights in such Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights (including the right to seek past and future
damages with respect to such Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property
Rights) to the Company or Company Subsidiary, has paid all royalties, fees or
other compensation required to be paid in connection with obtaining the same,

Intellectual Property Rights with the relevant Governmental Entity, including

entity. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any submission
or contribution to, and is not subject to any license or other Contract with,

of essentiality to or inclusion in an industry standard that would obligate
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant licenses or other rights to, or
otherwise impair its control of, any such Company Intellectual Property or
Company Products, nor has any third party request been made for such licenses
or other rights in connection with the activities of or any participation in

Intellectual Property by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or that may
affect the validity, use or enforceability of such Company Intellectual
Property or any Company Product. No Company Intellectual Property or Company
Product is subject to any third party rights, restriction, constraint,
control, supervision or limitation as a result of (i) the receipt or use by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any funding, facilities, personnel or

consents, approvals or waivers from third parties (provided, however, that in
no event shall this Section 5.4(c) require the Company or any Company

or approvals other than the Required Consents, and other than the fees and
expenses of advisors and agent it engages in connection with obtaining such
consents or approvals), (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(v) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to

purposes of, this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall this

with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board
shall, if any Legal Requirement is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use all
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Legal Requirement on the Merger, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of subsection (iii)
hereof, in connection with seeking any Required Consents, the Company shall
keep Parent informed of all material developments. Parent shall reasonably
cooperate with the Company and Company Subsidiaries in attempting to obtain
such Required Consents and, at Parent's reasonable request, Parent shall be
included in any communications with any parties whose consent, waiver or
approval is sought. The Required Consents shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent. In the event the Merger does not close other than as a

assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their
respective businesses and, in the case of Parent, the businesses of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary, or (iii) the imposition of any impediment

Effective Time, any further action on the part of the Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, tangible and intangible property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors
of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in
the name of their respective entities or otherwise to take, and will take, all
such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent
with this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.7. Termination of 401(k) Plan.   

 

  

Unless otherwise notified by Parent in writing, the Company shall, effective
as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and conditioned on the Closing,

Section 5.9. Tax Matters.   

 

  

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility and
authority as among Parent and the Stockholders' Agent for certain Tax matters:

  

  

(a) Tax Returns.

  

  

(i) Except as set forth herein, Parent shall have the exclusive obligation and
authority to prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be
timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
any of the Company Subsidiaries for any taxable year or period that ends on or
before the Closing Date that are due (including extensions) after the Closing
Date and for any Straddle Period (the "Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns" ). Any
Pre-Closing Period Tax Return to be filed by Parent with respect to the
Company, Surviving Corporation, or any of the Company Subsidiaries that
relates to Taxes for which the Stockholders may be liable hereunder shall be
prepared in accordance with past practices of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (unless substantial authority (as defined in Section 1.6662-4(d)
of the Regulations or any comparable provision of applicable state, local, or
foreign tax law) for a particular position does not exist), and submitted
(with copies of any relevant schedules, work papers, and other documentation
then available), to the Stockholders' Agent for review and comment at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return in
the case of any Pre-Closing Period Tax Return whose due date is two (2) months
or more from the end of relevant Tax period, and fifteen (15) days prior to
the due date for the filing of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return in case of
all other Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to prepare and provide to the Stockholders' Agent a package of Tax
information materials, including schedules and work papers required by the
Stockholders' Agent to enable it to timely review and comment on all Tax
Returns required to be prepared and filed pursuant to this Section 5.9. This
package of Tax information material shall be prepared in good faith and in a
manner consistent with past practices of the Company and Company Subsidiaries.
If the Stockholders' Agent does not object to such Tax Returns in writing
prior to seven (7) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return, the Stockholders' Agent shall be deemed to have consented to the
filing of such Tax Return, and the Company Stockholders shall pay to Parent
from the Escrow Fund, at least five (5) days before the due date of the
applicable Tax Return, an amount equal to the Taxes shown as due and payable
on such Tax Return (except to the extent reflected in a reserve for Taxes set
forth on the Final Statement of Net Working Capital) to the extent such Taxes
are due with respect to the Tax liability of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the event that such amount is not
paid from the Escrow Fund within the time frame set forth above, such amount
shall be withdrawn from the Escrow Fund immediately thereafter. In the event
that the Stockholders' Agent reasonably objects in writing to one or more
positions taken on a Pre-Closing Period Tax Return prior to seven (7) days
prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return, the Stockholders'
Agent shall provide the specific reasons for its objections to Parent, and
Parent and Stockholders' Agent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objection. In the event that Parent and the Stockholders' Agent are unable to
resolve such dispute prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, such
dispute shall promptly be submitted to a Tax Arbitrator for resolution in
accordance with the procedures described in Section 5.9(d), provided, however,
that if the Tax Arbitrator is unable to resolve such dispute prior to the
filing of such Tax Return, Parent shall only be entitled to receive a payment
from the Escrow Fund in accordance with this Section 5.9(a)(i) for the amount
of Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shown as due and payable on the Tax
Return that Stockholders' Agent asserts should be filed, and Parent shall file
such Tax Return in the manner asserted by Stockholders' Agent, provided that
there is substantial authority (as defined in Section 1.6662-4(d) of the
Regulations or any comparable provision of applicable state, local, or foreign
tax law) for the position asserted by Stockholder' Agent. If the Tax
Arbitrator subsequently resolves such dispute in favor of the Parent, Parent
shall be entitled to receive a payment from the Escrow Fund for the difference
between the amount the Tax Arbitrator determines Parent should have been
entitled to receive from the Company Holders and the amount of disbursement
Parent received from the Escrow Fund. Parent shall have the right to not allow
the submission of any Pre-Closing Period Tax Return to the Tax Arbitrator for
resolution, in which case Parent shall have the right to file such Tax Return
as it sees fit, but shall, with respect to any position that the Stockholders'
Agent has specifically objected to in writing as set forth above, forfeit its
right to any payment that it otherwise would have been entitled to under this
Section 5.9(a)(i) (other than the amount of payment that it would have been

(ii) Any withdrawal of an amount from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section
5.9(a) shall not preclude any remedies of the Company against the Company

other claim with respect to Taxes, or (ii) any voluntary contact with any Tax
Authority relating to Taxes, in each of clause (i) and (ii), affecting the
Taxes of or with respect to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
Company Subsidiary (items within clauses (i) or (ii) are referred to as a "Tax
Claim" ) that, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of
time would be grounds for a claim for indemnity pursuant to Section 8.2(a).
Thereafter, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders' Agent, as promptly as
possible but in no event later than ten (10) days after Parent's receipt
thereof, copies of all relevant notices and documents (including court papers)

delayed, provided that if Parent does not object to such settlement or
compromise within fifteen (15) days after the notice by the Stockholders'
Agent, Parent shall be deemed to have consented to such settlement or
compromise.

(ii) Except as provided in Section 5.9(b)(i), Parent (at its sole cost and
expense) shall have the right to control the conduct of or initiate any Tax
Claim of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; provided however, that, for
any Tax Claim relating to the Taxes of a Straddle Period that, if determined
adversely to the Company or any Company Subsidiary would be grounds for a
claim for indemnity pursuant to Section 8.2(a) hereof, (i) the Stockholders'
Agent may fully participate (at the Company Holders' expense) in the dispute
of such Tax Claim, (ii) the Parent shall keep Stockholders' Agent timely
informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of such Tax Claim

Claim without the consent of the Stockholders' Agent, which consent may not be

Agent does not object to such settlement or compromise within thirty (30) days
after the notice by Parent, the Stockholders' Agent may be deemed to have
consented to such settlement or compromise; provided, further, that in the
case of any voluntary contact with any Tax Authority affecting Taxes of or
with respect to the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any Company
Subsidiary, that may result in a claim for indemnity under Section 8.2(a),
Parent shall not initiate any such voluntary contact without the consent of
the Stockholders' Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

  

  

(c) Cooperation. Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall cooperate fully (at

for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of such cooperation), as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, examination, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding. Each of Parent and the Stockholders' Agent agrees, upon request,
to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Tax Authority as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereunder).

(d) Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy, or claim between Parent, on
the one hand, and the Stockholders' Agent, on the other hand, arising out of
or relating to the provisions of Section 5.9(a) or Section 5.9(b) as they
relate to Tax Claims or Tax Returns ("Tax Dispute" ) shall be resolved as
follows; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, any claim for
indemnification under Section 8.2 shall not be subject to the dispute
resolution procedure in this Section 5.9(d). Parent and the Stockholders'
Agent first shall attempt to resolve the Tax Dispute through negotiations. If
the Tax Dispute cannot be resolved by negotiations between Parent and the
Stockholders' Agent within thirty (30) days, it shall be submitted to a senior
tax partner in a mutually agreeable internationally recognized accounting firm
for resolution (the "Tax Arbitrator").

  

  

(i) Appointment of the Tax Arbitrator. Parent and the Stockholders' Agent
shall attempt to jointly agree to the appointment of the Tax Arbitrator;
provided, however, that if the parties are unable to jointly appoint such Tax
Arbitrator within twenty (20) days after the end of the thirty (30) day
negotiation period set out above in Section 5.9(d), either party may request
the American Arbitration Association's International Centre for Dispute
Resolution (the "ICDR") to appoint, within ten (10) days from the date of such
request or as soon as practicable thereafter, a partner in an independent,
internationally-recognized accounting firm who is an expert in the issue that
is the subject of the Tax Dispute, independent and impartial, as the Tax
Arbitrator.

  

  

(ii) Place of Arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be New York, New
York.

  

  

(iii) The Award. The Tax Arbitrator shall issue a written reasoned award. The
award of the Tax Arbitrator, which shall be governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq., shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Stockholders' Agent, Parent,
the Indemnifying Persons (and any Person entitled to any merger consideration)
and their respective affiliates to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirement and may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

  

  

(iv) Costs. The expenses of the Tax Arbitrator shall be borne by the party
that is required to pay the award.

(e) Refund. At the Stockholders' Agent's request, the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, and the Company Subsidiaries shall apply for any Tax refund
available for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, provided that there is a reasonable
basis for such refund claim. The Company Holders will be entitled to any
credits and refunds of Taxes (including any interest in respect thereof) with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period received by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries, and any amounts of overpayments of
Tax, including without limitation Israeli value-added Tax receivables and
Singapore goods and services Tax receivables, credited against Tax that
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries otherwise would
be or would have been required to pay, and Parent shall pay over to the Paying
Agent for distribution to the Company Holders any such amounts within fifteen
(15) days after the receipt or entitlement of such refund or credit or request
to return amounts not paid over to the appropriate taxing authority. With
respect to any Straddle Period, Parent shall pay Paying Agent for distribution
to the Company Holders within sixty (60) days after the Closing an amount
equal to the excess of (i) any estimated Tax payments made by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date for the taxable year
that includes the Closing Date over (ii) the Tax liability for the pre-Closing
portion of such taxable year (with respect to Taxes for which estimated Tax
payments were made) if such taxable year ended on the Closing Date. Parent
shall pay the Paying Agent for distribution to the Company Holders interest at
the rate prescribed under Section 6621(a)(1) of the Code, compounded daily, on
any amount not paid when due under this Section 5.9(e). Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 5.9(e) to the contrary, (i) Parent shall not be
required to pay any amounts to the Company Holders to the extent such amounts
are reflected as an asset on the Final Statement of Net Working Capital, and
(ii) such amounts shall be used to offset any unpaid indemnity obligation of
the Company Holders under Section 8.2 to the extent that the Escrow Fund is
not adequate to pay such indemnity obligation at the time such amount is
required to be paid to the Company Holders pursuant to this Section 5.9(e).

  

  

Section 5.10. Parachute Payment Waivers. The Company shall obtain and deliver
to Parent, prior to the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval
procedure under Section 5.11, a parachute payment waiver, from each person who
the Company reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined
immediately before the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval
procedure under Section 5.11 and who would otherwise reasonably be expected to
have, receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a parachute payment
under Section 280G of the Code as a result of (a) the accelerated vesting of
stock options or unvested property in connection with the Merger and/or the
termination of employment or service with the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent before, upon or following the Merger, (b) any severance
payments, bonus payments or other benefits or payments in connection with the
Merger and/or the termination of employment or service with the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent before, upon or following the Merger and/or
(c) the receipt of any Company Options or Company Capital Stock within the
twelve (12)-month period ending on the date the Effective Time occurs,
pursuant to which such person shall agree to waive any and all right or
entitlement to the accelerated vesting, payments, benefits options and stock
referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) (collectively, the "Payments") to the
extent the value thereof exceeds 2.99 times such person's base amount
determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the requisite stockholder approval of the
Payments is obtained pursuant to Section 5.11.

  

   

69 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

Section 5.11. 280G Stockholder Approval. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval by such number of
stockholders of the Company as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code so as to render the parachute payment provisions of
Section 280G of the Code inapplicable to any and all Payments, with such
stockholder vote to be obtained in a manner which satisfied all applicable
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  

  

Section 5.12. Company's Auditors. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its management and its independent auditors to
facilitate on a timely basis (a) the preparation of historic financial
statements (including pro forma financial statements if required) as required
to be filed by Parent with the SEC following the Closing pursuant to a Current
Report on Form 8-K and (b) the securing of a binding fee commitment (on terms
similar to those in place on the date of this Agreement) with respect to
consents and comfort letters requested by Parent after the Closing.

  

  

Section 5.13. Intellectual Property. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice if any Person prior to the Effective Time (or the earlier valid
termination of this Agreement), (a) commenced, or provided written notice to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary that it intends to commence, an action
or proceeding alleging that, or (b) provided written notice to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that, in each case, (i) any of the Intellectual
Property embodied in any of the Company Products or utilized in the Company's
business or in any Company-designed or modified development tools or design
environments infringes or otherwise violates the Intellectual Property Rights
of such Person, (ii) any such Intellectual Property is available for licensing
from a putative or potential licensor providing the notice, or (iii) otherwise
alleges that the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not own or have the
right to exploit such Intellectual Property.

  

  

Section 5.14. Resignation of Directors and Officers.

  

  

The Company shall cause the directors and officers of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary in office immediately prior to the Effective Time to resign
as directors and officers of each such company, effective as of the Effective
Time.

  

  

Section 5.15. Officers' and Directors' Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of, each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary
and agent of the Company and Company Subsidiaries provided for in their
respective charters or by-laws or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years (seven
(7) years in the case of the Israel subsidiary) from the Effective Time;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims
(each a "DandO Claim") asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such DandO Claim. Without limiting the general
indemnification rights of the Company Directors and Officers under this Section
5.15, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation also agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors
of the Company and Company Subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in any written
indemnification agreements which have been previously disclosed to Parent
between the Company and/or one or more of the Company Subsidiaries.

  

   

70 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(b) The obligations under this Section 5.15 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Director and
Officer to whom this Section 5.15 applies without the consent of such Company
Director and Officer (it being expressly agreed that the Company Directors and
Officers to whom this Section 5.15 applies shall be third party beneficiaries
of this Section 5.15 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained
herein).

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage (a "DandO Tail Policy"), the expense for
which shall be included in Company Fees and Expenses. Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such DandO Tail Policy in full
force and effect until the expiration of such policy.

  

  

Section 5.16. Employee Benefit Arrangements.

  

  

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, the employees of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries will continue to be provided with pension and welfare
benefits under employee benefit plans that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate than those currently provided by the Company and Company
Subsidiaries to such employees or substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, as elected by Parent
in its sole discretion. Parent will cause any employee benefit plans which the
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are eligible to
participate in to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting
thereunder, except for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement
benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits,
service by employees of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as if such
service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a
comparable plan of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the extent
that such time period is recognized under the terms of such plan of Parent.

  

  

(b) To the same extent that such service was recognized by the Company for
purposes of the Company Benefit Plans, to the extent permitted under the
applicable insurance contracts or plans, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans to
treat, the service of Surviving Corporation employees with the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries attributable to any period before the Effective Time as
service rendered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for all purposes
(except to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits),
including but not limited to, eligibility to participate, vesting and
applicability of any minimum waiting periods for participation. Without
limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable under the
Company's contracts with its insurance carrier(s), Parent shall not, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation not to, treat any Surviving Corporation
employee as a "new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any health
or similar plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation for a pre-existing
medical condition, and any deductibles and co-pays paid under any of the
Company's or any Company Subsidiaries' health plans shall be credited towards
deductibles and co-pays under the health plans of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to the extent recognized under the analogous Company Benefit
Plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (1) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (2) give any
third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.16, or (3)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to (i)
maintain any Company Benefit Plan or (ii) retain the employment of any
employee.

specific reference to this Section 7.1(b)); provided that the right to

authorizations, consents, orders or approvals of, or declarations or filings
with, or expirations of waiting periods imposed by any Governmental Entity
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby to expire or to be terminated early as of the End Date,
then either Parent or the Company may, each in its discretion, extend the End
Date by an additional thirty (30) day period by providing the other Party with
written notice of such extension on or before the original End Date (such
right of extension may only be exercised once by each party).

  

  

(c) by Parent, upon written notice to the Company, if the Company shall breach
any representation, warranty, obligation or agreement hereunder, such that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) would not be satisfied as of the End
Date, and such breach shall not have been cured, or by its nature cannot be
cured, within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Company of written notice of
such breach; provided that Parent may not exercise this right to terminate if
Parent has breached any of its representations, warranties, obligations or
agreements hereunder, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a)
would not be satisfied as of the End Date;

(d) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, if Parent or Merger Sub
shall breach any representation, warranty, obligation or agreement hereunder,
such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) would not be satisfied as
of the End Date, and such breach shall not have been cured, or by its nature
cannot be cured, within thirty (30) days following receipt by Parent of
written notice of such breach; provided that the Company may not exercise this
right to terminate if the Company has breached any of its representations,
warranties, obligations or agreements hereunder, such that the conditions set
forth in Section 6.3(a) would not be satisfied as of the End Date; and

  

  

(e) by Parent if any action taken, or any Legal Requirement enacted,
promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger, by any Governmental
Entity, which would: (i) prohibit Parent's ownership or operation of all or a
material portion of the business of the Company or (ii) compel Parent to
dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the assets and
properties of the Company, or materially limit its operation of the Company's
business, as a result of the Merger.

  

  

Section 7.2. Effect of Termination.

  

  

In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors, interest holders or affiliates, except to the extent that
such termination results from the material breach by a party hereto of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement;
provided that the provisions of Section 5.2 (Confidentiality), Section 5.3
(Public Disclosure), Section 9.8 (Expenses), this Section 7.2 and ARTICLE IX
hereof shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of
this Agreement.

(together with interest and other income thereon) to constitute the escrow
fund (the "Escrow Fund"), which shall be available to compensate Parent
Indemnified Persons pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Persons for Damages and be governed by the terms set forth

Section 8.2. Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Subject to the limitations and other terms set forth in this ARTICLE VIII,
from and after the Effective Time, the Company Stockholders (the "Indemnifying
Persons") shall indemnify and hold harmless the Surviving Corporation, Parent
and each of their respective officers, directors, affiliates, subsidiaries,
agents and employees, and each Person, if any, who controls or may control
Parent within the meaning of the Securities Act (hereinafter referred to
individually as a "Parent Indemnified Person" and collectively as "Parent
Indemnified Persons") from and against and pay on behalf of or reimburse any
such Parent Indemnified Person in respect of the entirety of any Damages of
the Parent Indemnified Persons as a result of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of,
or any claim by any third party alleging or constituting such a breach or
inaccuracy of, any of the representations and warranties made by the Company
in this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements, or any certificates
delivered by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this Agreement, in
each case other than the Specified Representations; (ii) fraud; (iii) any
breach or inaccuracy of, or any claim by any third party alleging or
constituting such a breach or inaccuracy of, any of the Specified
Representations; (iv) any breach or violation of, or any claim by any third
party alleging or constituting such a breach or violation or default in
connection with, any covenants or agreement made by or to be performed by the
Company or the Stockholders' Agent in this Agreement or in any of the
Ancillary Agreements, exhibits, schedules or certificates to, or delivered in
connection with this Agreement; (v) any liability for Taxes or any claim by
any third party alleging or involving liability for Taxes (A) of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) imposed on the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary being included for any Pre-Closing Tax Period in an Affiliated
Group that files consolidated or combined Tax Returns by reason of Treasury
Regulation § 1.1502-6 or any comparable provision of state, local or non-U.S.
law, (C) of any other Person for any Pre-Closing Tax Period which the Company
may be liable, including, without limitation, as a transferee, successor,
withholding or collection agent, by contract, or pursuant to any law, rule or
regulation, and (D) arising from any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant
or agreement relating to Taxes by any Company Holder or the Stockholders'
Agent under this Agreement, provided, however, notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, that the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be indemnified
for any liability for Damages or Taxes pursuant to Section 8.2(a), (w) that
are Transfer Taxes apportioned to Parent pursuant to Section 1.18, (x) to the
extent such Taxes were specifically identified and included as a liability in
calculating Net Working Capital, (y) that were otherwise paid or economically
borne by the Company or any Company Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date
or (z) resulting from transactions or actions, including without limitation
any Tax elections or voluntary contact with a Tax Authority in breach of
Section 5.9(b), taken by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Company
Subsidiary after the Closing outside the ordinary course of business (other
than actions specifically contemplated by this Agreement); provided, further,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, (I) the Indemnifying Persons shall be
obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties under Section 8.2(a)(v)
only in respect of out-of-pocket cash payments for Taxes on account of Pre-
Closing Tax Periods made by or on behalf of Parent or the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (II) the Indemnifying Persons shall not be obligated to
indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties as a result of any utilization of, or
reduction in, any Tax benefit, Tax attribute, or Tax benefit item attributable
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (III) each Indemnifying Person shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for the Recipient
Withholding Tax Indemnity of any other Person (Section 8.2(a)(v) shall be
referred to herein as the "Tax Indemnity"); (vi) any inaccuracy contained in
the Final Allocation Schedule, including without limitation, any Action or
Proceeding brought by any Person disputing or claiming any right to a portion
of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid Company Fees and Expenses or
Closing Indebtedness not set forth on the Final Allocation Schedule or the
Final Statement of Net Working Capital; (vii) any Damages from the matters set
forth on Schedule 8.2(a), and (viii) any amounts paid to holders of Dissenting
Shares in excess of the amount of the Merger Consideration allocated to such
holder in the Final Allocation Schedule.

(b) From and after the Closing, the right to obtain indemnification from the
Escrow Fund pursuant to the indemnification provisions of Section 8.2(a) shall
be the Parent Indemnified Persons' sole and exclusive remedy for monetary
damages, except in the case of (1) any IP Claim and (2) any Special Claims. In
the case of any claims for indemnification relating to any IP Claim, each
Indemnifying Person shall be severally (but not jointly) liable for such
Indemnifying Person's Proportionate Indemnification Share of the amount of
Damages resulting therefrom that exceed the Escrow Amount; provided, however,
that the maximum aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Persons with respect
to all IP Claims (other than as set forth in Section 8.2(e) (with respect to
fraud)) shall not exceed Seventy-Eight Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($78,750,000) in the aggregate; and provided, further, that any and
all claims for indemnification relating to any IP Claim must first be
satisfied out of the Escrow Fund and no such indemnification claim may be
pursued by any Parent Indemnified Person against any Indemnifying Person
unless and until the amount of the IP Claim is in excess of the amount of
funds remaining in the Escrow Fund. In the case of a Special Claim, each
Indemnifying Person shall be severally (but not jointly) liable for such
Indemnifying Person's Proportionate Indemnification Share of the amount of any
Damages resulting therefrom; provided, however, that, the maximum liability of
any Indemnifying Person under Section 8.2(a) with respect to Special Claims
(other than as set forth in Section 8.2(e) (with respect to fraud)) shall not
exceed an aggregate amount which would equal that portion of the Merger
Consideration that such Indemnifying Person is entitled to receive under this
Agreement, and provided, further, that any and all claims for indemnification
relating to any Special Claim must first be satisfied out of the Escrow Fund
and no such indemnification claim may be pursued by any Parent Indemnified
Person against any Indemnifying Person unless and until the amount of the
amount of the Special Claim is in excess of the amount of funds remaining in
the Escrow Fund. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall limit the rights of the Parent Indemnified
Persons to seek or obtain injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy to
which such Parent Indemnified Person is otherwise entitled.

  

   

79 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(c) Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be indemnified for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) (including with respect to any
IP Claim and any Operating Covenant Breach) unless and until (i) with respect
to any claim or series of related claims, each such claim or series of related
claims involves Damages in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000)
(the "Threshold"); and (ii) the aggregate amount of Damages for claims that
are each in excess of the Threshold exceeds One Million Seven Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($1,750,000) (the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent
that Damages from such claims exceed the Deductible; provided, however, that
any claims for Damages with respect to Special Claims shall not be subject to
the Threshold or Deductible.

  

  

(d) In determining the existence of a breach or the amount of any Damages, any
qualifications in the representations, warranties and covenants with respect
to a Company Material Adverse Effect, materiality, material or similar terms
shall be disregarded and will not have any effect with respect to the
calculation of the amount of any Damages attributable to a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or in any of the Ancillary Agreements, exhibits, schedules or
certificates to, or delivered in connection with this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.2, the
limitations in Section 8.2(a), Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c) or the
definition of "Damages" shall not apply with respect to any claim against an
Indemnifying Person for damages for or arising out of or relating to such
Indemnifying Person's commission of fraud.

  

  

(f) Where it is necessary for purposes of Section 5.9 or Section 8.2(a) to
apportion the Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or with respect
to the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Straddle Period,
any such liability for Taxes that are based on or measured by income,
receipts, sales, or payroll shall be apportioned between the period deemed to
end at the close of the Closing Date, and the period deemed to begin at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim
closing of the books at the end of the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the
taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the
Company or a Company Subsidiary holds a beneficial interest will be deemed to
terminate at such time), and the amount of other Taxes (such as real or
personal property Taxes) shall be allocated by taking the amount of such Tax
for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days in the portion of the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. For all purposes of this Section 8.2(f), any deductions and
expenses related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, Company Fees and Expenses and expenses related
to stock options) shall be allocated to the period deemed to end at the close
of the Closing Date.

(g) The Parent Indemnified Persons shall take all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring
costs only to the extent reasonably necessary to remedy the breach which gives
rise to such Damages, provided, however, that nothing herein shall require any
Parent Indemnified Person to sue any Person or to make a claim under any
insurance policy of any Parent Indemnified Person prior to making a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the amount of any Damages subject to indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII
shall be calculated net of (i) any insurance proceeds actually received by any
Parent Indemnified Person on account of such Damages under insurance policies
of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect prior to the Closing and (ii)
any amounts actually recovered by the Parent Indemnified Person under other
indemnity agreements (excluding insurance policies), or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible therefor, without duplication. While not a
prerequisite for making a claim for indemnification hereunder, the Parent
Indemnified Person shall take all commercially reasonable actions as the
Stockholders' Agent may reasonably request to seek recovery of such amounts
available under such insurance coverage or other indemnity agreement (other
than indemnity agreements with existing customers or vendors). In the event
that a Parent Indemnified Person shall receive any insurance proceeds after
receiving payment from the Indemnifying Persons pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII,
such Parent Indemnified Person shall remit such amounts (less any costs
incurred by Parent to obtain such recovery) to the Escrow Agent for
distribution to the Indemnifying Persons.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event shall any Parent Indemnified Person be entitled to duplicate or multiple
recoveries under this Agreement. In particular, in the event any circumstances
giving rise to Damages constitute a breach of more than one representation and
warranty, obligation or covenant of the Company, the Parent Indemnified
Persons shall only collectively be entitled to be indemnified once in respect
of such Damages.

  

  

Section 8.3. Survival; Escrow Period.

  

  

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement shall survive until the first Business Day that is on or after the
day that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, provided, however,
that the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.11 (Technology
and Intellectual Property) shall survive until the first Business Day that is
on or after the day that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date,
and provided, further, that the Specified Representations shall survive until
the first Business Day that is on or after the day that is thirty (30) days
after the applicable statute of limitations has expired. In no case shall the
termination of the representations and warranties affect any claim for
misrepresentation or breach thereof or default thereunder if written notice of
such misrepresentation, breach or default is given to the Stockholders' Agent
prior to such termination. It is the express intent of the parties that, if an
applicable survival period as contemplated by this Section 8.3 is shorter than
the statute of limitations that would otherwise apply, then, by contract, the
applicable statute of limitations shall be reduced to the survival period
contemplated hereby. The parties further acknowledge that the time periods set
forth in this Section 8.3 for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are
the result of arms'-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend
for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

(b) The escrow period (the "Escrow Period") shall terminate at 11:59 p.m.
Atlanta time on the first Business Day that is on or after the day eighteen
(18) months after the Closing Date (the "Escrow Release Date"). On the first
Business Day following the Escrow Release Date, the Escrow Agent shall release
any funds remaining in the Escrow Fund to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that a portion of the Escrow Fund
that is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied or unresolved claims for Damages
specified in any Officer's Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to
termination of the Escrow Period shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such
claims have been resolved.

  

  

Section 8.4. Claims Upon Escrow Fund.

  

  

(a) Any Parent Indemnified Person may make claims against the Escrow Fund
hereunder by giving written notice thereof to the Stockholders' Agent as soon
as reasonably practicable, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, on or before the
last day of the Escrow Period by submitting a certificate signed by any
officer of Parent (an "Officer's Certificate") specifying in reasonable detail
all material information then available regarding the nature of such claim,
assertion, event or proceeding and shall specify the representation, warranty
or covenant in this Agreement under which the liability or obligation is
asserted, the amount and nature of Damages or potential Damages sought and the
method and metrics used in calculation of such Damages. If indemnification is
sought for a claim, assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect of any
third party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Parent Indemnified Person shall give
the Stockholders' Agent, as applicable, written notice of such Third Party
Claim as to which such Parent Indemnified Person may request indemnification
hereunder, as soon as reasonably practicable after the time that such Parent
Indemnified Person learns of such Third Party Claim. Upon receipt by the
Escrow Agent on or before the last day of the Escrow Period of an Officer's
Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall set aside a portion of the Escrow Fund
equal to such Damages, but shall not release it unless otherwise permitted
under Section 8.4(c) below. The failure of the Parent Indemnified Person to
give notice as provided in this Section 8.4 shall not relieve the Company
Stockholders from any liability except to the extent that they are actually
and materially prejudiced by the failure or delay in giving such notice;
provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to any failure of any
Parent Indemnified Person to give notice prior to the end of the applicable
survival period set forth in Section 8.3, which shall continue to act as a bar
to recovery for indemnification under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) In the event that the Stockholders' Agent shall object in good faith to
the indemnification of a Parent Indemnified Person in respect of any claim or
claims specified in an Officer's Certificate, the Stockholders' Agent shall,
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Officer's Certificate, deliver
to the Parent Indemnified Person a notice to such effect (an "Objection
Notice"), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such objection.
Upon delivery of an Objection Notice, the Stockholders' Agent and the Parent
Indemnified Person shall, within the sixty (60) day period beginning on the
date of delivery of such Objection Notice, attempt in good faith to agree upon
the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims to
which the Stockholders' Agent shall have so objected. If the Stockholders'
Agent and the Parent Indemnified Person shall succeed in reaching agreement on
their respective rights with respect to any of such claims, they shall
promptly prepare and execute joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to no
longer set aside funds or to release funds from the Escrow Fund, as described
therein ("Joint Instructions"). In the event that the Parent Indemnified
Person and the Stockholders' Agent are unable to agree as to any particular
item or items or amount or amounts identified in the Objection Notice, then
each party shall be entitled to pursue its available remedies for resolving
the claim for indemnification by submitting such dispute to a court of
competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 9.7.

  

   

82 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(c) Upon the earliest of: (i) receipt of written authorization from the
Stockholders' Agent or any Joint Instructions providing for the payment of
Damages, (ii) receipt of written notice of an award in binding arbitration or
final, non-appealable judicial determination of the claim and the amount of
any Damages, or (iii) in the event the Damages set forth in the Officer's
Certificate is uncontested by the Stockholders' Agent as of the close of
business on the next Business Day following the thirtieth (30th) day following
receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Officer's Certificate, on the next Business
Day the Escrow Agent shall deliver the portion of the Escrow Fund to Parent
equal to the amount of such Damages.

  

  

(d) In the event that a Third Party Claim gives rise to an indemnification
claim (other than any IP Claim and except as otherwise provided in Section
5.9(b) (Tax Contests)), the Stockholders' Agent may elect, at its own expense,
to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim on behalf of the
Company Stockholders and any litigation resulting therefrom; provided that
counsel for the Company Stockholders, who shall conduct the defense of such
claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the Parent
Indemnified Person (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld or
delayed), and the Parent Indemnified Person may participate in such defense at
the Parent Indemnified Person's expense, which shall include counsel of its
choice; provided further that, if the Stockholders' Agent (i) does not elect
to defend, compromise or settle a Third Party Claim within fourteen (14) days
of receiving notice thereof, or (ii) having elected to defend a Third Party
Claim, fails to retain counsel to prosecute the action within fourteen (14)
days of such election, then in such case the Parent Indemnified Person shall
have the right to defend such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the
account and risk of the Company Stockholders. The Stockholders' Agent shall
not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Escrow Agent shall not disburse any portion of the Escrow Fund to any third
party except in accordance with a Joint Instruction.

  

  

(e) In case of any Third Party Claim involving an IP Claim, the provisions of
Section 8.4(d) shall not apply, and instead Parent may elect to assume and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting
therefrom; provided that counsel for Parent, who shall conduct the defense of
such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the
Stockholders' Agent (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld or
delayed), and the Stockholders' Agent may participate in such defense on
behalf of the Company Stockholders (at its expense), which shall include
counsel of its choice; provided further that, if Parent (i) does not elect to
defend, compromise or settle such Third Party Claim within fourteen (14) days
of receiving notice thereof, or (ii) having elected to defend such Third Party
Claim, fails to retain counsel to prosecute the action within fourteen (14)
days of such election, then in such case the Stockholders' Agent shall have
the right to defend such Third Party Claim. Parent shall not settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders' Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Escrow Agent shall not disburse any portion of the Escrow Fund to any third
party except in accordance with a Joint Instruction.

  

   

83 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(f) No Parent Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have unreasonably withheld
its consent to any such proposed settlement or compromise that contains any
term that does not consist entirely of a monetary payment and that does not
include an unconditional release from all liability without future obligation
or liability on the part of the Parent Indemnified Person and its Affiliates
without any admission of guilt, liability or wrongdoing on the part of any
Parent Indemnified Person. If a Parent Indemnified Person refuses to consent
to a bona fide offer of settlement which the Stockholders' Agent, on behalf of
the Company Stockholders, wishes to accept and which provides solely for
monetary payment and includes an unconditional release from all liability
without future obligation or prohibition on the part of the Parent Indemnified
Person and does not contain an admission of guilt, liability or wrongdoing on
the part of the Parent Indemnified Person and such settlement has no adverse
effect on the reputation of such Parent Indemnified Person, the Parent
Indemnified Person may continue to pursue such matter, free of any
participation by the Stockholders' Agent, at the sole expense of the Parent
Indemnified Person. However, in such event, the obligation of the Company
Stockholders shall be limited to the amount of the offer of settlement which
the Parent Indemnified Person refused to accept.

  

  

(g) The Stockholders' Agent and the Parent Indemnified Persons shall cooperate
with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of
any claim, including making available records relating to such claim and
furnishing such employees of the Parent Indemnified Person and its affiliates
as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of any such
claim or for testimony as witnesses in any proceeding relating to such claim.
In defending or settling any Third Party Claim, Parent shall not be deemed to
be an agent of, and shall have no duty, including, without limitation, any
fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, duty of good faith or duty of disclosure, to
the Company Holders or the Stockholders' Agent.

Section 8.5. Stockholders' Agent.

  

 

  

(a) The Company Stockholders, by approving this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and the other Company Holders irrevocably appoint and
constitute Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the Stockholders' Agent
for and on behalf of the Company Holders. The Stockholders' Agent shall have
full power and authority to take any and all actions which it believes are
necessary or appropriate under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
including, without limitation, to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement as the Stockholders' Agent and for all other purposes
hereunder and thereunder, to give and receive notices and communications, to
interpret on behalf of the Company Holders all of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to authorize delivery to Parent of
the applicable portion of the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent,
to object to such deliveries, to defend all indemnity claims against the
Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 8.4(d) of this Agreement (an "Indemnity
Claim"), to conduct negotiations with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective agents regarding such claims, to deal with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of
Indemnity Claims, and request arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into and provide amendments and supplements to and waivers in respect of
this Agreement, in accordance with Section 9.9 and Section 9.10 of this
Agreement, and the Escrow Agreement, retain legal counsel, accountants,
consultants and other experts, and incur any other reasonable expenses, in
connection with all matters and things set forth or necessary with respect to
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, to obtain reimbursement as provided for herein for all
out-of-pocket fees and expenses and other obligations of or incurred by the
Stockholders' Agent in connection with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
and to take all other actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholders' Agent for the accomplishment of any or all of the foregoing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholders' Agent
shall have the full power and authority to interpret on behalf of the Company
Holders all the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof in its capacity as
Stockholders' Agent. Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority
in interest of the Escrow Fund from time to time upon not less than ten (10)
days' prior written notice to all of the Company Holders, the Escrow Agent and
to Parent. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders' Agent, and the
Stockholders' Agent shall receive no compensation for its services, except as
provided in that certain Engagement Letter to be entered into by and among the
Stockholders' Agent, the Company and certain Company Holders. Notices or
communications to or from the Stockholders' Agent shall constitute notice to
or from each of the Company Holders.

  

  

(b) The Stockholders' Agent shall not be liable to any Company Holders for any
act done or omitted hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement as Stockholders'
Agent while acting in good faith and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Company
Stockholders shall severally and pro rata, in accordance with their respective
Proportionate Indemnification Share, indemnify the Stockholders' Agent and
hold it harmless against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including
the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense
of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative
Losses" ) arising out of or in connection with the Stockholders' Agent's
execution and performance of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholders' Agent, the Stockholders' Agent will reimburse the Company
Stockholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent
attributable to such gross negligence or bad faith. If not paid directly to
the Stockholders' Agent by the Company Stockholders, any such Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Stockholders' Agent from (i) the Expense
Amount, and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company Stockholders;
provided, that while this section allows the Stockholders' Agent to be paid
from the Expense Amount and the Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the Company
Stockholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses
as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholders' Agent
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event
will the Stockholders' Agent be required to advance its own funds on behalf of
the Company Stockholders or otherwise. This indemnification shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Stockholders' Agent or the termination of this
Agreement. Neither Parent, Merger Sub, the Company nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be in any way responsible to any Company Holder for any loss
suffered by reason of the performance by the Stockholders' Agent of its duties
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Expense Amount shall be used
to reimburse the out of pocket fees and expenses (including legal, accounting
and other advisors' fees and expenses, if applicable) incurred by the
Stockholders' Agent in performing all of its duties and obligations under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(c) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit an amount equal to the Expense Amount
with the Escrow Agent; the Expense Amount shall be held in a separate account
by the Escrow Agent solely for the use of the Stockholders' Agent to pay the
Representative Losses (including, without limitation, all Representative
Losses arising in connection with claims for indemnification hereunder)
related to the Stockholders' Agent's actions taken with respect to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and shall not be deemed to be part of the
Escrow Fund. Neither Parent nor any Parent Indemnified Person shall have any
right, title or interest to the Expense Amount under this Agreement or
otherwise. The Stockholders' Agent shall have sole signature authority over
such separate account, and may pay any Representative Losses out of such
account and be reimbursed or reimburse any third party for any Representative
Losses from the Expense Amount at any time in its sole discretion. Should the
Expense Amount not suffice for payment of the Representative Losses, the
Stockholders' Agent shall be entitled to call upon the Indemnifying Persons to
contribute additional amounts to such account, in proportion to their
Proportionate Indemnification Share, provided, however, that if the
Stockholders' Agent believes that the Representative Losses incurred in
connection with the performance of its duties will exceed the Expense Amount,
the Stockholders' Agent will obtain the approval of a majority in interest of
the Escrow Fund prior to commencing such activities. Following the termination
of the Escrow Period, the Stockholders' Agent shall have the right to recover
Representative Losses from the Escrow Fund from any amount that would
otherwise be distributed to the Indemnifying Persons and, prior to any such
distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth
the unreimbursed Representative Losses actually incurred. The Stockholders'
Agent shall provide Escrow Agent (but shall not be required to provide Parent)
with reasonable documentation as to the Expense Amounts, provided that such
documentation may be redacted as necessary to preserve attorney-client
privilege. Any amounts remaining in the Expense Amount as of the date of the
final distribution to the Indemnifying Persons or payment to the Parent
Indemnified Persons of any and all remaining amounts of the Escrow Fund shall
be released to the Escrow Agent for payment to the Company Stockholders in
proportion to their Proportionate Indemnification Share, as instructed in
writing by the Stockholders' Agent.

control of the Company (as the Surviving Corporation) and Parent and the
reasonable assistance of the Company's (as the Surviving Corporation) and
Parent's officers and employees for purposes of performing his duties and
exercising his rights under this ARTICLE VIII, provided that the Stockholders'
Agent shall treat confidentially and not, except in connection with enforcing
its rights under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, disclose any
nonpublic information from or about the Company (as the Surviving Corporation)
or Parent to anyone (except to the Stockholders' Agent's attorneys,
accountants or other advisers, to Company Stockholders and, on a need to know
basis, to other individuals (identified to the Company and Parent in writing
in advance) who agree in writing to treat such information confidentially).

Surviving Corporation may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction

of each and every Indemnifying Person and Company Holder. The Escrow Agent and
Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done
by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders' Agent. The Stockholders' Agent is directed to comply with final,
nonappealable orders or decisions issued or entered by any court of competent
jurisdiction or arbitrator with respect to the Escrow Funds. If any portion of
the Escrow Funds is disbursed to the Stockholders' Agent and is at any time
attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the
payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property
shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment
or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any
part thereof, then and in any such event, the Stockholders' Agent is
authorized, in its sole discretion, but in good faith, to rely upon and comply
with any such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal
counsel selected by it is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other
action; and if the Stockholders' Agent complies with any such order, writ,
judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any Person by reason of such
compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled set aside or vacated.

  

  

Section 8.7. No Right of Contribution.

  

  

Neither the Stockholders' Agent nor any Company Holder shall make any claim
for contribution from the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
any indemnity claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement to the
extent that the Company, Surviving Corporation or any Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification hereunder for such claim, and the Stockholders'
Agent, on its own behalf and on behalf of all Indemnifying Persons, hereby
waives any such right of contribution from the Company or the Surviving
Corporation it has or may have in the future.

Section 8.8. Treatment of Payments.

  

  

Any payment under ARTICLE VIII of this Agreement shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be treated by the parties for income Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration. If an indemnity payment to be paid by
the Indemnifying Person under this is taxable to the Indemnified Person, the
amount otherwise to be paid by the Indemnifying Person shall be increased to
take account of any Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Person (grossed up
for such increase) as a result of the receipt of the indemnity payment.
