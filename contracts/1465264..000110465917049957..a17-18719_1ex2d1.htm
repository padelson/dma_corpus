Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), and (ii) a separate statement (x)

without giving effect to the Closing (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "),
and (y) showing any calculations with respect to any proposed Purchase Price
Adjustment (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule_ "). Sellers will (x)
permit Buyer and its advisors and representatives reasonable access to the
books, records, properties, premises, work papers, personnel and other
information of the Business that is in the possession of Sellers and their
Affiliates to permit Buyer and its advisors to prepare the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule or to address any
dispute described in this Section 2.9 and (y) reasonably cooperate with Buyer
and its advisors and representatives in connection with such preparation,
including providing on a timely basis all other information necessary or
useful in connection with the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule as is reasonably requested by Buyer
or its advisors or representatives. Buyer will (x) permit, and will cause the
Company to permit, Sellers and their advisors and representatives reasonable
access to the books, records, properties, premises, work papers, personnel and
other information of the Business to permit Sellers and their advisors to
review the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Purchase Price Adjustment
Schedule or to address any dispute described in this Section 2.9 and (y)
reasonably cooperate, and will cause the Company to reasonably cooperate, with
Sellers and their advisors and representatives in connection with such review
or any dispute, including providing on a timely basis all other information
necessary or useful in connection with the review of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Schedule as is reasonably requested by Sellers or their advisors or
representatives. The Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule shall be prepared in
accordance with the guidelines set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ and accompanied
by reasonable backup documentation relating to the calculations therein. The
Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule and the calculation of the Net Working
Capital contained therein shall entirely disregard (A) any and all effects on
the assets or liabilities of the Business as a result of any financing or
refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by Buyer or any other
transaction entered into by Buyer in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) any of the plans, transactions or
changes which Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or
made after the Closing with respect to the Business.

 



 

(c) Sellers shall, within sixty (60) days following their receipt of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule, accept
or reject the Purchase Price Adjustment submitted by Buyer. If Sellers
disagree with the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Purchase Price Adjustment
Schedule or any calculation thereon, they shall give written notice to Buyer
of such dispute and any reason therefor within such sixty (60) day period.
Should Sellers fail to notify Buyer of a dispute within such sixty (60) day
period, Sellers shall be deemed to agree with Buyers calculation. In the
event there is a dispute, Buyer and Sellers shall attempt to reconcile their
differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be
final,

 



      
 

 



 

binding and conclusive on the Parties. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to
reach a resolution with such effect within thirty (30) days after the receipt
by Buyer of Sellers written notice of dispute, Sellers and Buyer shall submit
the items remaining in dispute for resolution to KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is
unwilling or unable to serve, by a nationally recognized accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer (such identified or selected firm,
the " _Independent Accountant_ "). The Independent Accountant shall act as an
arbitrator and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to issue its report
as to all matters in dispute (and only such matters) and the determination of
the Purchase Price Adjustment within thirty (30) days after such dispute is
referred to the Independent Accountant. In making its determination, the
Independent Accountant (i) shall not have the power to modify or amend any
term or provision of this Agreement, (ii) shall make its determination based
solely on the information presented to it by the Parties and shall not
undertake any independent review, (iii) shall be bound by the terms of this
Agreement, including the guidelines set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ and (iv)
shall not assign a value to any item higher than the highest value for such
item claimed by either Party or less than the lowest value claimed by either
Party. Buyer on the one hand, and Sellers on the other hand, shall bear all
costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with such arbitration,
except that the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant hereunder
shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, in
the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items
so submitted to the Independent Accountant that is unsuccessfully disputed by
each such Party (as finally determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to
the total amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted. This provision
for arbitration shall be specifically enforceable by the Parties and the
decision of the Independent Accountant in accordance with the provisions
hereof shall be final and binding with respect to the matters so arbitrated
and there shall be no right of appeal therefrom.

 



 

(d) The Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule shall be deemed final for the
purposes of this Section 2.9 upon the earliest of (i) the failure of Sellers
to notify Buyer of a dispute within sixty (60) days of Buyers delivery of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule to
Sellers, (ii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.9(c), by
Sellers and Buyer or (iii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section
2.9(c), by the Independent Accountant.

 



 

(e) Upon finalization of the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule, the following
adjustments will be made:

 



 

(i) If the Closing Net Working Capital shown on the Purchase Price Adjustment
Schedule as so finally determined in accordance with Section 2.9(d) is greater
than the Net Working Capital Target (the amount of such difference being the "
_Net Working Capital Surplus_ "), then the Closing Purchase Price shall be
adjusted upward in an amount equal to the Net Working Capital Surplus and
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, within three (3) Business Days of the
finalization of the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule, to Sellers an amount
equal to such Net Working Capital Surplus by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to one or more accounts designated by Sellers; and

 



 

(ii) If the Closing Net Working Capital shown on the Purchase Price Adjustment
Schedule as so finally determined in accordance with Section 2.9(d) is less

 



      
 

 



 

than the Net Working Capital Target (the amount of such difference being the "
_Net Working Capital Deficit_ "), then the Closing Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downward in an amount equal to the absolute value of the Net Working
Capital Deficit and Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid, within three (3)
Business Days of the finalization of the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule,
to Buyer an amount equal to the absolute value of such Net Working Capital
Deficit by wire transfer in immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by Buyer.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Closing Purchase Price as
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.9 (plus any additional amounts treated as
consideration under applicable Treasury Regulations) (the " _Allocable
Purchase Price_ ") shall be allocated among the Equity Interests and the
Additional Transferred Assets (and shall be further allocated among the
Companys assets to the extent required under applicable Tax Law) as provided
herein. All allocations under this Agreement shall be made in accordance with
the requirements of Sections 1060, 743(b), 751 and 755 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder. No later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers its determination of
the allocation (the " _Proposed Allocation_ ") of the Allocable Purchase
Price. Buyer will (x) permit, and will cause the Company to permit, Sellers
and their advisors and representatives reasonable and timely access to the
books, records, properties, premises, work papers, personnel and other
information of the Business to permit Sellers and their advisors to review the
Proposed Allocation or to address any dispute described in this Section 2.10,
provided that in no event shall any such access unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the Business and (y) cooperate fully, and will cause the
Company to cooperate fully, with Sellers and their advisors and
representatives in connection with such review or any dispute, including
providing on a timely basis all other information necessary or useful in
connection with the review of the Proposed Allocation as is reasonably
requested by Sellers or their advisors or representatives and that is
reasonably available to Buyer or the Company. Sellers shall, within thirty
(30) days following their receipt of the Proposed Allocation, accept or reject
the Proposed Allocation submitted by Buyer. If Sellers disagree with the
Proposed Allocation, they shall give written notice to Buyer of such dispute
and describing in reasonable detail any reason therefor within such thirty
(30) day period. Should Sellers fail to notify Buyer of a dispute within such
thirty (30) day period, Sellers shall be deemed to agree with Buyers Proposed
Allocation. In the event there is a dispute, Buyer and Sellers shall attempt
to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. If Sellers and
Buyer are unable to reach a resolution with such effect within thirty (30)
days after the receipt by Buyer of Sellers written notice of dispute, Sellers
and Buyer shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the
Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall act as an arbitrator
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to issue its report as to all
matters in dispute (and only such matters) and the determination of the
allocation of the Closing Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 2.10
within thirty (30) days after such dispute is referred to the Independent
Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall not have the power to modify or
amend any term or provision of this Agreement. Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by them
in connection with such arbitration, except that the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant hereunder shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount
of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accountant
that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such

 



      
 

 



 

Party (as finally determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to the total
amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted. This provision for
arbitration shall be specifically enforceable by the Parties and the decision
of the Independent Accountant in accordance with the provisions hereof shall
be final and binding with respect to the matters so arbitrated and there shall
be no right of appeal therefrom. Buyer and Sellers covenant and agree that the
allocations made pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be conclusive and final
for all purposes of this Agreement and shall be used by them in reporting the
Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the preparation of any required IRS Form 8594). Neither Buyer nor Sellers
shall take any position (whether in connection with audits, Tax Returns or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocations, except as may be
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code (or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law). The
Parties shall cooperate to adjust the allocations made pursuant to this
Section 2.10 to reflect any subsequent adjustments made to the Closing
Purchase Price. Sellers shall ensure that at least 56% of the Allocable
Purchase Price, as finally adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, is allocated
to the Company Partnership Interests.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made net of any Taxes required by applicable tax Law
to be deducted or withheld from such payment and (b) any amounts deducted or
withheld from any such payment shall be remitted to the applicable taxing
authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid. If any Party becomes aware that any amount is required to be so
deducted or withheld, it shall promptly notify the applicable Party of any
such required deduction or withholding and reasonably cooperate with such
applicable Party to minimize any such deduction or withholding.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Transaction Structure_. Buyer will reimburse Sellers for all
reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses owed to a third party by Sellers
or their Affiliates and incurred by Sellers and their Representatives in
connection with the transaction structure changing between signing and Closing
as reflected by this Agreement (collectively, the " _HDS Restructuring
Expenses_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(including _Sections 6.6(c) _and _6.6(d)_ ), Buyer, Merger Sub, Blocker,
Blocker Merger Sub and, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies will jointly
and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified
Parties from, against and in respect of any and all claims, liabilities,
obligations, losses, costs, expenses, penalties, Taxes, fines and judgments
(at equity or at law) and damages suffered or incurred by any Seller
Indemnified Party whenever arising or incurred (including amounts paid in
settlement, costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) arising out of or relating to the change in transaction structure
from the Purchase Agreement to the alternative transaction structure as set
forth in this Agreement; _provided_ that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Sellers agree to treat (a) the acquisition by Buyer of the
Company Partnership Interests in the Company Merger as a purchase of the
Company Partnership Interests by Buyer, (b) the Blocker Merger as a part-sale,
part-redemption of the HD Waterworks Equity Interests and (c) the transfer of
the Additional Transferred Assets as a purchase of the Additional Transferred
Assets by the Company, and will report the transactions as such for all
applicable tax purposes, in each case, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
final "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. In
the event that any Seller Indemnified Party believes that it is, or that it
may be, entitled to indemnification pursuant to the foregoing sentence in
respect of any matter, it shall promptly notify Buyer in writing; provided,
however, that the

 



      
 

 



 

failure to provide such prompt notice shall not release Buyer, Merger Sub,
Blocker, Blocker Merger Sub and, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies,
from any of their respective indemnification obligations under this _Section
2.12_ except to the extent such Persons are actually and materially prejudiced
by such failure. In the event that such claim for indemnification involves a
pending or threatened claim or demand by a third party against such Seller
Indemnified Party which relates exclusively to the alternative transaction
structure set forth in this Agreement, Buyer may, by notice to such Seller
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days following receipt of such
notice, assume the defense and control of such matter with its own counsel and
at its own expense; _provided_ , that the Seller Indemnified Party shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such third
party action with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the Buyer assumes
the defense of such third-party claim, such assumption will conclusively
establish for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that third-
party claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification under this
_Section 2.12_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that in no event will Sellers
be deemed to have breached any provision hereof, nor will any conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ be deemed not to have been satisfied, due to the
transaction structure changing between the execution of the Purchase Agreement
and Closing as reflected by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no
representation or warranty made in the Purchase Agreement (or any Schedule
related thereto) shall be deemed to have been (or required to have been)
brought down or deemed made (or required to have been made) as of the date of
this Agreement.

Section 401(a) of the Code that is intended to be exempt from taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") or other letter indicating
that it is so qualified or is in the process of obtaining such a letter. To
the Knowledge of Sellers, nothing has occurred since the issuance of the IRS
determination letters referred to in this clause (iv) that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect such qualification or exemption, as the case may
be.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened claim
(other than a routine claim for benefits), proceeding, examination, audit,
investigation or other proceeding with respect to any Company Benefit Plan,
except where any such claim, investigation, examination, audit or other

Sellers, any organizational campaigns, petitions or other unionization
activities seeking recognition of a bargaining unit in the Business or of any
Employee.

directly or indirectly violated or taken any act in furtherance of violating
any provision of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (as amended)
or any other anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws or regulations applicable to
the Business. To the Knowledge of Sellers, the Relevant Persons have not in
the course of their actions for, or on behalf of, the Business engaged

applicable economic or trade sanctions law.

Section 5.5 _Financial Capability_.

 



 

(a) _Exhibit 5.5_ attached hereto contains, true, complete and correct copies
of (i) an executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the Effective Date
(the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), from Clayton, Dubilier and Rice Fund IX,
L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (the " _Equity Financing
Source_ "), pursuant to which the Equity Financing Source has committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to invest in Buyer the
amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), (ii) an executed debt
commitment letter, dated as of the Effective Date (including all related
exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and term sheets thereto, and as
amended from time to time after the Effective Date in compliance with _Section
6.8_, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity
Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ ") from the lenders party
thereto (collectively, the " _Committed Lenders_ ") and the arrangers party
thereto, pursuant to which the Committed Lenders have committed, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide to Buyer debt financing
in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ and,
together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ ") and (iii) the fee
letter related to the Debt Commitment Letter, except that the existence and/or
amount of fees, flex provisions, pricing terms, pricing caps and other
commercially sensitive numbers specified therein have been redacted (such fee
letter, the " _Fee Letter_ "). As of the Effective Date, the Commitment
Letters are in full force and effect and have not been amended or modified.
Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ and _Article IV_ (for the avoidance of doubt, giving effect to
the last two sentences of _Section 2.12_), Buyer has no reason to expect as
of the Effective Date (x) that any of the conditions to the Financing
contained in the Commitment Letters to be satisfied by it or its Affiliates
will not be satisfied or (y) that any portion of the Financing will not be
available to Buyer on the Closing Date. Assuming the Financing is funded on
the Closing Date in accordance with the Commitment Letters, the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and _Article
IV_, the performance by Sellers and their Affiliates of their respective
obligations under this Agreement, including the obligations set forth in
_Section 6.8(d)_, and the satisfaction of all of the conditions to the
obligation of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the aggregate proceeds of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters will be sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to
be paid by Buyer on the Closing Date to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Buyer has delivered to Sellers the limited guarantee, dated as of the
Effective Date (the " _Limited Guarantee_ "), duly executed by the Equity
Financing Source in favor of Sellers with respect to the performance by Buyer
of certain payment obligations under this Agreement. As of the Effective Date,
the Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Equity Financing Source, except as the
enforceability thereof may be limited by (x) bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to
or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and (y) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

Section 5.6 _Solvency_. Buyer is not entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Company. Assuming (i) that
the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and _Article
IV_ are true and correct in all material respects (for the avoidance of doubt,
giving effect to the last two sentences of _Section 2.12_), (ii) that Sellers
and Buyer have each complied with their respective obligations under this
Agreement, (iii) that the most recent financial forecasts for the Business
made available to Buyer by Sellers prior to the Effective Date have been
prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable, (iv) the satisfaction of the conditions to Buyers obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (v) that,
immediately prior to the Closing, without giving effect to the Financing, the
Business is Solvent, at and immediately after the Closing, and after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing, the
repayment, redemption, discharge or refinancing of any Indebtedness of the
Business and the payment of all fees and expenses required to be paid by Buyer
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Financing), Buyer and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be
Solvent.

BLOCKER MERGER SUB HAS CONDUCTED ITS OWN INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF

in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
information and analysis (including financial analysis) relating to such bids,
or (ii) any document or information, the disclosure of which could reasonably
be expected, upon the advice of counsel, to result in the loss of protectable
interests in trade secrets, or result in the waiver of any legal privilege or
work-product privilege (provided that Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such document or information in an alternative
or redacted format, as appropriate, that would not reasonably be expected to
result in such loss or waiver). Further, Buyer and its counsel, environmental
consultants, investment bankers, financial sources, lenders and other
representatives will not, prior to the Closing, conduct any environmental
assessments, studies, investigations or monitoring pertaining to Environmental
Laws or Hazardous Substances and relating to the Owned Real Property or the
Leased Real Property, including any Phase I environmental site assessment,
Phase II environmental site assessment, or invasive sampling of soil,
groundwater, air, any other environmental media, or building materials or
equipment.

 



 

(b) All information furnished or provided by any Seller, the Company, or any
of their respective Affiliates or representatives to Buyer or its
representatives (whether furnished before or after the date of this Agreement)
shall be held subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(c) Following the Closing, Buyer agrees to make personnel of Buyer or its
Affiliates available to Sellers to the extent such access is reasonably
necessary for Sellers to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any
applicable Law; _provided_ , that such access to personnel shall not interfere
unreasonably with the operations of the Business.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Consents_.

 



 

(a) The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain all licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each of Sellers and Buyer will promptly provide the other with copies of
all written communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance of all
oral communications) between each of them, any of their Affiliates or any of
its or their representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers and Buyer will promptly notify the other of the receipt and content of
any inquiries or requests for additional information made by any Governmental
Entity in connection therewith and will promptly (i) comply with any such
inquiry or request and (ii) provide the other with a description of the
information provided to any Governmental Entity with respect to any such
inquiry or request. In addition, each of Sellers and Buyer will keep the other
apprised of the status of any such inquiry or request.

 



 

(c) Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall, and each shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the approval of any Governmental Entity of any of the
aforementioned filings.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall cooperate in good faith with all Governmental Entities and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shall undertake
promptly any and all actions required to complete lawfully the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including proffering and consenting to a
governmental order providing for the sale or other disposition, or the holding
separate, of particular assets, categories of assets or lines of business,
whether assets or lines of business of the Business or of any other assets or
lines of business of Buyer or any of its Affiliates in order to remedy any
concerns that any Governmental Entity may have, or proffering and consenting
to any other restriction, prohibition or limitation on any of the Additional
Transferred Assets or assets of HD Waterworks Inc. or the Company, Buyer or
any of Buyers Affiliates, in order to remedy any such concerns. The entry by
any Governmental Entity in any legal proceeding of a governmental order
permitting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby but which
is subject to certain conditions or requires Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
take any action, including any restructuring of the Additional Transferred
Assets or assets of HD Waterworks Inc. or the Company or lines of business of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any changes to the existing business of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, shall not be deemed a failure to satisfy any
of the conditions specified in _Article VII_.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. The Parties shall each use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable after the Effective Date. Each Party
further covenants and agrees, with respect to a threatened or pending
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or
statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the
ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, to
use its reasonable best efforts to prevent or lift the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, the Parties shall not issue any report, statement or press release or
otherwise make any public statements with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby without the other Partys consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except, as in the reasonable
judgment of a Party, may be required by Law or by the rules of a national
securities exchange, and in any event a Party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other Party a reasonable time in advance of such
required disclosure.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.6 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or other similar
agreement between an Acquired Company, on the one hand, and any Seller (or any
Affiliate of any Seller other than an Acquired Company), on the other hand,
shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and shall have no further effect
for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future year, or a past
year). Sellers shall also terminate, or cause to be terminated, all other Tax
sharing, Tax indemnity or other similar agreements to which any Acquired
Company is a party such that, as of the Closing, no Acquired Company will have
any further obligations to any Person under any such Tax agreements.

 



 

(b) _Responsibility for Filing Income Tax Returns for Periods Ending on or
Before the Closing Date, Including Short Tax Years_.

 



 

(i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Company will be considered
as terminated pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will be required to file a
final partnership Tax Return for the short taxable year ending on the Closing
Date, and (B) pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii), HD
Waterworks Inc. will have a short taxable year ending on the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) From the Effective Date, Sellers shall be responsible for preparing and
filing (A) all Tax Returns that include HD Waterworks Inc. and that are
required to be filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with any
Seller or any Affiliate of Sellers for all taxable periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, (B) all other income Tax Returns of HD Waterworks Inc.
and all income Tax Returns of the Company for the taxable periods of HD
Waterworks Inc. or the Company, as applicable, ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, including any short Tax year ending on the Closing Date and (C)
all other Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to any Acquired
Company that are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that, in each case, any such Tax Returns shall be prepared and
filed in a manner consistent with most recent past practice.

 



 

(iii) _Section 754 Election_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Parties shall cause the Company to make an
election under Section 754 of the Code (and any similar election under any
provision of any other Tax Law) for the taxable period that ends on the
Closing Date unless such an election is already in effect with respect to the
Company.

 



 

(iv) _Consolidated Return Elections_. Sellers shall make or cause to be made
(and shall refrain from making or causing to be made, as applicable) Tax
elections (including on a protective basis) so that HD Waterworks Inc. shall
suffer no reduction in tax basis or other attributes pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-36. Sellers shall cause the consolidated federal
income Tax Return filed by HD Supply Holdings, Inc. for the taxable period
that includes the Closing Date to be filed in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(i) (determined using the closing of the

 



       
 

 



 

books method), with no election under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) and no application of Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii).

 



 

(c) _Post-Closing Transactions_. Buyer agrees to indemnify Sellers and their
Affiliates for any additional Tax owed by Sellers and their Affiliates
resulting from (i) any transaction engaged in by HD Waterworks Inc. or the
Company not in the Ordinary Course on the Closing Date after Buyers purchase
of the Equity Interests, unless such transaction was initiated by Sellers
prior to the Closing, is at the request of Sellers or is otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) any election under Section 338 of the
Code (or any corresponding provision of state or local Tax Law) with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall make any such
indemnification payment within fifteen (15) days following delivery by Sellers
to Buyer of notice of indemnification required by this _Section 6.6(c)_.
Sellers shall provide documentation explaining in reasonable detail the
calculation and rationale for any claim to Buyer stating that such additional
Taxes are due or that payment by any Sellers or their Affiliates of such
additional Taxes has been made. The procedures provided in _Section _
_6.6(e)_ relating to reviewing, disputing, negotiating and resolving claims
shall apply to any claim made under this _Section 6.6(c)_.

 



 

(d) _Responsibility for Filing Other Tax Returns_. Except for the Tax Returns
described in _Section 6.6(b)_, Buyer shall, at its own expense, prepare or
cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax
Returns of HD Waterworks Inc. and the Company that are required to be filed
after the Closing Date. Sellers shall indemnify Buyer and the Acquired
Companies for (i) Taxes owed by either Acquired Company or with respect to any
Additional Transferred Assets for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date (together with any interest, penalty or additions to Tax accruing
after the Closing Date on any such Taxes and including any such Taxes,
interest, penalties or additions to Tax assessed in connection with a Tax
Proceeding in respect of such taxable periods), and (ii) Taxes of any Person
arising under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or comparable provisions
of U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax Law by reason of any Acquired Company
having been a member of a consolidated, combined, affiliated, unitary or other
similar tax group prior to the Closing, except in each case to the extent such
Taxes were reflected as a liability on the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule.
The procedures provided in _Section 6.6(e)_ relating to reviewing, disputing,
negotiating and resolving claims shall apply to any claim made under this
_Section 6.6(d)_. For purposes of this _Section 6.6(d)_, in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "), the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such
Taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes
other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related
to income or receipts (including income Taxes and sales and use Taxes), be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable
period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits or estimated Tax payments
relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the
relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Review Rights_. With respect to any Tax Return required to be prepared
and filed by Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.6(b)(ii)(B)_ or _(C)_ , or to be
prepared and filed by Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.6(d)_ for any Taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, including
any Straddle Period, the party preparing such Tax Return shall provide the
other Party with copies of such Tax Return, along with all schedules,
statements, workpapers and supporting documentation (the " _Supporting
Documentation_ ") promptly after the preparing Party has prepared such Tax
Return and Supporting Documentation. The non-preparing Party shall have the
right to review any such Tax Return and Supporting Documentation; _provided_ ,
that the preparing Party shall not be required to request an extension of time
for the filing of such Tax Return and the preparing Party shall have the right
to file such Tax Return even if the non-preparing Party has not completed its
review of such Tax Return and Supporting Documentation or has objected to any
such Tax Return; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the non-preparing Party
shall not be required to reimburse the preparing Party for any Taxes paid by
the preparing Party and for which the non-preparing Party is responsible under
this _Section 6.6_ with respect to such Tax Return, if any, until the non-
preparing Party has had an opportunity to review such Tax Return and
Supporting Documentation. If the non-preparing Party disputes any item(s)
shown on any such Tax Return, the non-preparing Party shall notify the
preparing Party within ten (10) Business Days after receiving such Tax Return
and the Supporting Documentation. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith
and use reasonable best efforts to resolve any disputed items. If such Parties
are unable to resolve any disputed items within thirty (30) days after the
receipt by the non-preparing Party of the Tax Return filed or proposed to be
filed, such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accountant, which
shall resolve any issue in dispute as promptly as practicable. If any disputed
issue has not been resolved prior to the date the preparing Party files the
Tax Return in question, the preparing Party shall be reimbursed by the non-
preparing Party the amount of Taxes for which the non-preparing Party is
responsible, if any, that are not in dispute with respect to such Tax Return.
Upon resolution of any dispute by Sellers and Buyer or by the Independent
Accountants delivery of its determination to Buyer and Sellers, the Parties
shall make appropriate reconciling payments to each other in order to reflect
the resolution by Sellers and Buyer or the Independent Accountants
determination, as the case may be. The determination by the Independent
Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be shared equally by Buyer and
Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall not be required to provide
to Buyer any Tax Return described in _Section 6.6(b)(ii)(A)_ or any
Supporting Documentation with respect to any such Tax Return.

 



 

(f) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes (including any penalties and interest)
imposed on the transfer of the Equity Interests or the Additional Transferred
Assets to Buyer shall be paid by Buyer when due, and Buyer will, at its own
expense, file, or cause to be filed, all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other similar Taxes, and, if required by applicable
Law, Sellers will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution
of any such Tax Returns and other documentation, _provided_ that Sellers shall
be given the opportunity to review and comment on any such Tax Return or other
documentation before joining in the execution thereof, _provided_ , _further_
that if the amount of such Taxes paid by Buyer exceeds $200,000, Sellers shall
reimburse Buyer in an amount equal to 50% of the excess of such Taxes over
$200,000.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any Tax refunds that are actually received by
Buyer or an Acquired Company, and any amounts credited against Taxes
attributable to Tax periods or portions thereof beginning after the Closing
Date to which Buyer or an Acquired Company becomes entitled (including any
interest paid or credited with respect thereto), that relate to Tax periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date and to the extent not
reflected as an asset on the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule shall be for
the account of Sellers, and Buyer shall pay over to Sellers an amount equal to
such refund actually received or amount of any such credit (less out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such refund or credit and less
any Taxes incurred in connection with the receipt of such refund or credit)
within fifteen (15) days after receipt or realization thereof. Any such
refunds or credits relating to any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Buyer and Sellers in accordance with _Section 6.6(d)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, all other refunds and credits in respect of Taxes
received by an Acquired Company following the Closing (whether relating to the
portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date or otherwise)
shall be for the account of Buyer.

 



 

(h) _Amendments to Returns; Refund Claims_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall
not amend any Tax Return for HD Waterworks Inc. or the Company for a Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date without the consent of Sellers,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not be permitted to file, refile or amend any
Tax Return that is described in _Section 6.6(b)(ii)(A)_. Upon written request
of Sellers, Buyer shall, at Sellers expense, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the relevant entity to file for, and obtain and expedite the
receipt of, any refund that is for the account of Sellers under _Section
6.6(g)_.

 



 

(i) _Tax Cooperation_. Buyer and Sellers will cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns relating to the operations of HD Waterworks Inc. and the
Company and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Cooperation includes (i) the retention and (on the other Partys request) the
provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to the
filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding and
(ii) making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
Agreement. Each of Sellers and Buyer agrees (A) to retain all books and
records of HD Waterworks Inc. and the Company with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to HD Waterworks Inc. or the Company, as applicable, relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, (B) to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity, and (C) to
give the other Party reasonable written notice before transferring, destroying
or discarding any books and records and, if the other Party so requests, allow
such other Party to take possession of the books and records.

 



 

(j) _Tax Contests_. If any Party (or its Affiliates) receives any written
communication from any taxing authority regarding any audit, examination or
other proceeding (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to any Tax Return
described in _Section 6.6(b)(ii)(B)_, _Section 6.6(b)(ii)(C)_, _Section
6.6(d)_ (or, in each case, any Taxes relating thereto), such Party shall
promptly notify the other Party (or Parties, as the case may be) of its
receipt of such communication. Sellers shall have the right to control any
such Tax Proceeding to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

relating to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer
shall have the right to control all other Tax Proceedings. In either case, the
party controlling such Tax Proceeding shall ( _i_ ) notify the other Party of
significant developments with respect to such Tax Proceeding and keep the
other Party reasonably informed and consult with the other Party as to any
issue that could adversely affect such other Party, ( _ii_ ) give to the other
Party a copy of any Tax adjustment proposed in writing with respect to such
Tax Proceeding and copies of any other written correspondence with the
relevant taxing authority relating to such Tax Proceeding, ( _iii_ ) not
settle or compromise any issue without the consent of such other Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and ( _iv_ ) otherwise permit the
other Party to participate in all aspects of such Tax audit, examination or
proceeding, at such other Partys own expense.

 



 

(k) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any amount paid pursuant to this _Section
6.6_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Preservation of Records_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each Party agrees that it shall, and it shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) to, (a) preserve and keep the records
(including all Tax and accounting records) of the Business in its possession
for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing, or for any longer periods as
may be required by any Governmental Entity or ongoing litigation, and (b) make
such records available to the other Party as may be reasonably required by the
other Party. If a Party or its Affiliates wish to destroy such records after
the time specified above, such Party shall first give sixty (60) days prior
written notice to the other Party, and the other Party shall have the right at
their option and expense, upon prior written notice given that sixty (60) day
period, to take possession of the records within ninety (90) days after the
date such Partys receipt of notice.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary to arrange and
obtain the Financing on a timely basis (taking into account the anticipated
timing of the Marketing Period) on terms and conditions no less favorable to
Buyer than those contained in the Commitment Letters (including any "market
flex" provisions that are contained in the Fee Letter), including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters
(subject to the right of Buyer to replace, restate, supplement, modify,
assign, substitute or amend the Commitment Letters in accordance herewith),
(ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letter (such definitive agreements being referred to as the " _Debt Financing
Agreements_ ") on terms and conditions no less favorable to Buyer than those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (including any such
"market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter) and with no conditions
to the funding of the Debt Financing Agreements other than those contained in
the Commitment Letters delivered on the Effective Date and attached as
_Exhibit 5.5_, (iii) satisfy, and use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Debt Financing Sources to satisfy, on a timely basis (taking into account the
anticipated timing of the Marketing Period) or obtain the waiver of all
conditions applicable to Buyer contained in the Commitment Letters (or any
definitive agreements related thereto), (iv) consummate the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment

 



      
 

 



 

Letters and the Fee Letter substantially concurrently with the Closing and (v)
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing
Agreements (including through litigation diligently pursued in good faith).
Buyer shall keep Sellers informed upon request on a reasonable basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing. Buyer
shall give Sellers prompt notice upon having knowledge of any breach by any
party of any of the Commitment Letters or any termination of any of the
Commitment Letters. Buyer shall provide Sellers with any material notices from
the Debt Financing Sources relating to the availability of the Debt Financing
at the Closing.

 



 

(b) Other than as set forth in _Section 6.8(c)_, Buyer shall not, without the
prior written consent of Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), permit any material amendment or
modification to be made to, or any material waiver of any provision or remedy
under, the Commitment Letters (it being understood that the exercise of any
"market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter shall be deemed not to be
an amendment, modification or waiver) to the extent such amendment,
modification or waiver would (i) impose new or additional conditions to the
receipt of the Financing, or otherwise amend or modify any of the conditions,
to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially impair or delay the Closing or (ii) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing such that Buyer would not or does not have
sufficient cash proceeds to permit Buyer to pay the Closing Purchase Price and
all other amounts required to be paid by Buyer on the Closing Date under this
Agreement; _provided_ that Buyer may amend, supplement or modify the Debt
Commitment Letter to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities (or titles with respect to such
entities) so long as such addition or replacement would not affect the
availability of the total Debt Financing on the Closing Date; _provided
further_ that Buyer shall notify Sellers in writing of any amendment,
supplement or other modification of, or waiver of any provision or remedy
under, the Commitment Letters not otherwise prohibited by the foregoing clause
(i) or (ii), promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, after
the time such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is agreed. Upon
any such amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waiver under, the
Equity Commitment Letter or Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this
_Section 6.8(b)_, the term "Equity Commitment Letter" or "Debt Commitment
Letter", as applicable thereto, shall mean such Commitment Letter as so
amended, supplemented, modified or waived.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any "market flex" provisions that are contained in the
Fee Letter) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (other
than as a result of Sellers material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, or failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Article VII_),
Buyer shall (x) promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days,
notify Sellers of such unavailability and (y) promptly use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing for any such portion of
the Debt Financing from the same or alternative sources, which may include one
or more of a senior secured debt financing, an offering and sale of notes, or
any other financing or offer and sale of other debt securities, or any
combination thereof (the " _Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ that Buyer
shall not be required to arrange or obtain any Alternative Financing having
terms and conditions less favorable to Buyer in any material respect (as
reasonably determined by Buyer) than the terms and conditions (including
"market flex" provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letter. In the event Buyer enters into any Alternative Financing, (i) any
reference in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the
commitment letter with respect to such Alternative Financing, (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall be deemed to include
such Alternative Financing (and consequently the term "Financing" shall be
deemed to include the Equity Financing and the Alternative Financing), (iii)
any reference in this Agreement to the "Committed Lenders" shall be deemed to
include the persons committing to provide such Alternative Financing and (iv)
any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing Sources" shall be
deemed to include the persons providing or arranging such Alternative
Financing; _provided further_ that Buyer shall deliver to Sellers complete and
correct copies of all amendments, supplements, other modifications or
agreements pursuant to which any Alternative Financing shall be made available
to Buyer promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Day, after the
time such amendments, supplements, other modifications or agreements are
agreed ( _provided_ , that the existence and/or amount of fees, flex
provisions, pricing terms, pricing caps and other commercially sensitive
numbers specified in any fee letter may be redacted).

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) to, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause any of their respective personnel and Representatives
(including legal and accounting representatives) to, use their reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Buyer as necessary in connection with the
arrangement and obtaining of the Debt Financing or any high-yield bonds being
issued in lieu of all or a portion of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer and is customary for financing of such type ( _provided_ ,
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of Sellers or any of their Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies)), including:

 



 

(i) (A) furnishing Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources as promptly as
practicable with (x) the Audited Financial Statements, accompanied by the
audit reports thereon of PricewaterhouseCoopers and (y) unaudited combined
balance sheets and related statements of income and cash flow of the Business
prepared in accordance with GAAP for any subsequent interim period ended at
least 45 days prior to the Closing Date and for the comparable period of the
prior fiscal year, together with all related notes and schedules thereto (the
" _Interim Financial Statements_ "), in the case of each of clauses (x) and
(y), prepared in accordance with GAAP and in compliance with Regulation S-X
(other than Rules 3.03(e), 3-09, 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X), (B)
furnishing Buyer and the Debt Financing Sources as promptly as practicable
with all other financial information reasonably necessary to allow Buyer to
prepare pro forma financial statements (including for the most recent four
fiscal quarter period ended at least 45 days prior to the Closing Date)
prepared in accordance with GAAP, which need not be prepared in compliance
with Regulation S-X or include adjustments for purchase accounting to the
extent not customary in private placements pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated
under the Securities Act, financial data, business and other information
(including a customary "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" with respect to the Business) regarding
the Business of the type that would be required by Regulation S-X (including
Item 3-05 thereof, but excluding Rules 3.03(e), 3-09, 3-10 and 3-16 of
Regulation S-X) and Regulation S-K (other than Item 402 of Regulation S-K) for
a registered public offering of non-convertible debt securities of Buyer, in
each case to the extent the same is of the type and

 



      
 

 



 

form customarily included in, and subject to other exceptions that are
customary for, an offering memorandum for private placements of non-
convertible high-yield bonds under Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities
Act, or otherwise necessary to receive from the independent auditors of the
Business (and any other auditor to the extent financial statements audited or
reviewed by such auditor are or would be included in such offering memorandum)
customary "comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort) with respect to
the financial information of the Business to be included in such offering
memorandum and which, with respect to the Interim Financial Statements, shall
have been reviewed by the independent auditors of the Business as provided in
AU 722 and (C) using reasonable best efforts to cause the auditors of the
Business to furnish consents for use of their unqualified audit reports in any
materials relating to the Debt Financing or any high yield bonds being issued
in lieu of all or a portion of the Debt Financing (the authorization letters
referred to in clause (v) below, the draft comfort letters referred to in
clause (vii) below and all information specified in this clause (i), the "
_Required Information_ "); _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, such
Required Information shall not include, the preparation of pro forma financial
information by the Sellers and their Affiliates; _provided_ , further, that
the Sellers and their Affiliates shall not be required to provide any audited,

Section 6.9 _Employees; Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Sellers shall
(i) update _Exhibit 3.18_ to reflect any changes that have occurred after the
Effective Date (in compliance with _Section 6.1_) and (ii) deliver such
updated Exhibit to Buyer. Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of
this _Section 6.9(a)_, as soon as practicable following the Effective Date,
but in any event, not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the Closing Date
(or, if later, within thirty (30) days of the date _Exhibit 3.18_ is updated
pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence, but not later than five (5)
days prior to the Closing Date), Buyer shall make an offer of employment
commencing as of the Closing Date to each employee set forth in _Exhibit
3.18(c)_ and to each other individual listed on _Exhibit 6.9(a)-1_
(collectively, " _Employees_ "), whether salaried or hourly (including any
such Employee who is absent due to vacation, holiday, illness or other
approved leave of absence), in the same initial job or position and same
initial location as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (i)
at an initial salary or wage level and target bonus opportunity at least equal
to the salary or wage level and target bonus opportunity to which such
Employees were entitled immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) with
benefits, perquisites and other terms and conditions of employment that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits, perquisites and
other terms and conditions that such Employees were receiving from Sellers and
their Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date (including benefits
pursuant to qualified retirement and savings plans, and active-employee
medical, dental and pharmaceutical plans and programs, but excluding deferred
compensation and equity-based compensation and post-employment health or
defined benefit pension benefits). Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable
law, it is intended that acceptance of such offers of employment shall be
evidenced by the Employees attendance at work on Closing Date (or, if
applicable, upon expiration of leave or disability). Sellers shall advise the
Employees that there is no ongoing role for them at Sellers and its Affiliates
after the Closing and that they will not be entitled to severance pay or
termination benefits from Sellers or their Affiliates if they decline an offer
and their employment is subsequently terminated by Sellers and their
Affiliates. Those Employees who accept such offers of employment with Buyer
effective as of the Closing Date (or, if applicable, upon expiration of leave
or disability) shall be referred to herein as

 



       
 

 



 

" _Transferred Employees_." Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Buyer shall
not make any offer of employment to those individuals listed on _Exhibit
6.9(a)-2_ (each, an " _Excluded Employee_ ") and (y) following the Closing
Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall provide each Transferred Employee, as of
the Closing Date, with compensation and benefits (including incentive and
equity-based compensation) at least as favorable as the compensation and
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates.
Buyer acknowledges that the Employees are currently employed by HD Supply
Management, Inc., an Affiliate of the Company, and Sellers acknowledge that
Buyer may satisfy its obligations under this _Section 6.9(a)_ through one or
more of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 6.9(a)_, (i) the terms and conditions of employment of Employees
covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall, following the Closing
Date, continue to be governed by such collective bargaining agreement (as may
be amended or modified following the Closing Date), and (ii) the effective
date of the offer of employment as to any Employee on disability as of the
Closing Date (each, an " _Inactive Employee_ ") shall be the date that such
Inactive Employee is cleared for return, and does return, to work, so long as
such date occurs within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date, whereupon such
Inactive Employee shall commence to be treated as a Transferred Employee for
purposes of this Agreement (and any such offer shall lapse as to any such
Inactive Employee who has not returned to work within such twelve (12) month
period).

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.9(a)_, Buyer agrees that:
(i) Buyer will assume all liabilities to provide, and will provide, welfare
benefits, effective on the Closing Date, including continuation coverage
pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA to persons
whose "qualifying event" occurs on or before the Closing Date, with respect to
any Employee or former employee who primarily performed services for the
Business and the "qualified beneficiaries" of any such Employee or former
employee, with "qualifying event" and "qualified beneficiaries" defined under
Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA (all such welfare benefits
to be provided effective on the Closing Date, whether or not an election for
such continuation coverage is in effect on such date); (ii) Buyer will cause
the benefit plans applicable to the Transferred Employees to recognize all
previous service with the Company, the Companys Affiliates, and such
entities predecessor entities for the purpose of determining eligibility for
and entitlement to succeeding benefits, including vesting (excluding for
purposes of post-employment health benefits or defined benefit pension
benefits, and other than where such crediting would result in a duplication of
benefits for the same period of service); (iii) Buyer will cause the benefit
plans applicable to the Transferred Employees to recognize all costs and
expenses incurred by the Transferred Employees (and their dependents and
beneficiaries) up to (and including) the Closing Date, for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-
pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on coverage under any
such benefit plan, and to waive any preexisting condition, evidence of
insurability, good health or actively-at-work exclusions for the Transferred
Employees; (iv) for the remainder of the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs, the vacation and holiday plan offered to Transferred Employees shall
be equal to what the Company or its Affiliates, as applicable, would have
provided the Transferred Employees had they remained employees of the Company
or its Affiliates, as the case may be; and (v) Buyer shall maintain for at
least one (1) year starting on the Closing Date the same severance
arrangements applicable to the Transferred Employees that were in effect
immediately before the Closing Date (the " _Sellers  Severance
Arrangements_"). ** **_Exhibit ** ** 6.9(b)_ attached hereto sets forth the
details of the Sellers Severance Arrangements applicable to the Transferred
Employees.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Buyer will make available to each Transferred Employee such number of
unused vacation days and other paid time off accrued by such employee with any
Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller prior to the Closing Date in accordance
with applicable personnel policies applicable to such employees on the
Effective Date.

 



 

(d) Each Transferred Employee who is a participant in the HD Supply 401(k)
Retirement Plan (the " _Seller Savings Plan_ ") shall cease to be an active
participant under each such plan effective as of the Closing Date. Effective
as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall have in effect a defined contribution plan
that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of
the Code with terms and conditions equivalent to the Seller Savings Plan (the
" _Buyer Savings Plan_ ") in which the Transferred Employees shall be eligible
to participate. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, the Seller
Savings Plan shall transfer to the Buyer Savings Plan in a transfer in
compliance with Section 414(l) of the Code, and Buyer agrees to cause the
Buyer Savings Plan to accept, each Transferred Employees account balance
(including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans and subject to
any qualified domestic relations orders pursuant to Section 414(p) of the
Code) under the Seller Savings Plan as of the valuation date next preceding
the date of transfer. Such transfer shall be subject to Sellers receipt from
Buyer of a current determination letter from the IRS that the Buyer Savings
Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code and, if
necessary, such further information satisfactory to Sellers that the Buyer
Savings Plan is so qualified. Following such transfer, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall assume all liabilities of Sellers and their Affiliates under
the Seller Savings Plan to provide benefits to or on behalf of the Transferred
Employees to the extent of the account balances so transferred, and neither
the Seller Savings Plan nor Sellers nor their Affiliates shall have any
obligation to Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer or with respect to any
Transferred Employee with respect to the account balances so transferred.

 



 

(e) Following the Closing Date, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide that Buyer shall receive the benefit of any "stop loss"
insurance maintained by Sellers in respect of catastrophic medical claims
incurred prior to the Closing Date and for which the Buyer has the liability
under this Agreement.

 



 

(f) No provision of this _Section 6.9_ is intended to or shall be construed
to (a) create any third-party enforcement rights in any Employee or other
Person, (b) amend any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement,
(c) require Buyer, Sellers or any Affiliates of either of them to continue any
employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement beyond the time when it
otherwise lawfully could be terminated or modified or (c) provide any Employee
or any Transferred Employee with any rights to continued employment with any
Person.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Use of Names and Trademarks_. The Parties acknowledge that
Sellers and their Affiliates are retaining all rights with respect to the name
"HD," "HDS," "HD Supply" and all derivations thereof, including "HD Supply
Waterworks" (collectively, the " _HD Supply Marks_ "). As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer will, at its own expense, remove any and all
exterior signs and other identifiers located on or attached to the Acquired
Companies property, buildings, vehicles, signs or premises that refer or
pertain to or that include the HD Supply Marks. Additionally, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event

 



      
 

 



 

within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will remove from all of
the Companys letterhead, envelopes, invoices, supplies, labels, product
packaging and inserts, web site publications, promotional materials, marketing
collateral, advertisements, and other communications media of any kind, all
references to the HD Supply Marks. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither
it nor any Acquired Company shall have any right to use any of the HD Supply
Marks or any derivative thereof after the conclusion of the ninety (90) day
period immediately following the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Guarantees; Commitments_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing, Buyer, HD Waterworks Inc. and the Company, jointly and
severally, shall forever indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and any
of their Affiliates against any losses or liabilities that Sellers or any of
their Affiliates suffer, incur or are liable for by reason of or arising out
of: (i) Sellers or any of their Affiliates issuing, making payment under,
being required to pay or reimburse the issuer of, or being a party to, any
guarantee, surety bond, letter of credit, letter of comfort or other similar
support obligation to the extent relating to the Business, including those
listed on _Exhibit 6.11(a)_ (collectively, the " _Indemnified Guarantees_ ");
(ii) any claim or demand for payment made on Sellers or any of their
Affiliates with respect to any of the Indemnified Guarantees; or (iii) any
Action by any Person who is or claims to be entitled to the benefit of or
claims to be entitled to payment, reimbursement or indemnity with respect to
any Indemnified Guarantees.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause itself or one of its
Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for Sellers and any of their
Affiliates, and for Sellers and their Affiliates to be released, effective as
of the Closing, in respect of all obligations of Sellers and any of their
Affiliates under each of the guarantees, letters of credit, surety bonds,
letters of comfort and other similar support obligations of such Persons
related to the Business listed on _Exhibit 6.11(b)_. For any items listed on
_Exhibit 6.11(b)_ for which Buyer or one if its Affiliates is not substituted
in all respects for Sellers and their Affiliates (and for which Sellers and
their Affiliates are not released) effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall
continue to use its reasonable best efforts and shall cause the Company to use
its reasonable best efforts to effect such substitution and release after the
Closing.

 



 

(c) After the Closing, with respect to any Lease that continues to be
guaranteed by Sellers or any of their Affiliates pursuant to an Indemnified
Guarantee (a " _Guaranteed Lease_ "), Buyer and the Company shall not (and
they shall ensure that the tenants under the respective Guaranteed Leases
shall not) take any action that increases or has the effect of increasing
Sellers or their Affiliates obligations under such Guaranteed Lease beyond
the obligations of Sellers or their Affiliates, as the case may be, as in
existence on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Termination of Intercompany Arrangements_. Sellers shall cause,
effective at the Closing, all arrangements, understandings or Contracts
relating to Affiliate Transactions, including those set forth on _Exhibit
6.12,_ to be automatically terminated without any party having any continuing
obligation to the other. Sellers shall cause all intercompany balances between
Sellers and their Affiliates other than the Acquired Companies, on the one
hand, and the Acquired Companies on the other hand, to be cancelled in full
without payment immediately prior the Closing (other than those related to
trade payables and receivables in the Ordinary

 



      
 

 



 

Course). For the avoidance of doubt, any agreements, understandings or
Contracts entered into by Sellers or any of their Affiliates, other than the
Company, with a third party, shall not be terminated pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided_ ; _however_ , that except to the extent expressly
provided in the Supply Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement or
otherwise agreed to in writing by Sellers and Buyer, the Business shall no
longer receive any benefits under such agreements, understandings or
Contracts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.12_,
the Parties agree that the Company and HD Supplys "USA Blue Book" business
will continue their "joint selling" arrangement currently in place consistent
with past practices through the end of HD Supplys 2017 fiscal year.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Excluded Assets and Liabilities_. Immediately prior to the
Closing, the Company will transfer to certain Affiliates of Sellers the assets
and liabilities listed on _Exhibit 6.13_ (the " _Excluded Assets and
Liabilities_ "). After the Closing, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall
forever indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) against any losses or liabilities that
Buyer or any of its Affiliates suffer, incur or are liable for to the extent
arising out of the Excluded Assets and Liabilities, including in respect of
any Action against Buyer and any of its Affiliates to the extent related to
the Excluded Assets and Liabilities, except to the extent specifically
reflected as a liability on the Purchase Price Adjustment Schedule, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.9.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Leased Real Property_. Prior to the Closing Date (and assuming
the receipt of all necessary third-party consents by Sellers), Sellers shall
assign or cause to be assigned to the Company all right, title and interest in
the lessees or tenants interest in any Lease for Leased Real Property where
the Company is not the lessee or tenant under such Lease as of the Effective
Date, other than any Leases for real property identified on _Schedule
6.15(d)_.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Shared and Other Locations_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Sellers will use their reasonable best efforts, and
cause their Affiliates (other than the Company and HD Waterworks Inc.), to
vacate all of their operations, property and personnel from the Owned Real
Property identified on _Schedule 6.15(a)_. If any such operations, property
and personnel are not vacated from such Owned Real Property prior to the
Closing, Buyer will provide for a reasonable transition period during which
such operations, property and personnel can be vacated from such Owned Real
Property at Sellers cost consistent with past practice.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Sellers will use their reasonable best efforts to,
and will cause the Company to, vacate all of its operations, property and

property prior to the Closing, Sellers will (and will cause their applicable
Affiliates to) provide for a reasonable transition period during which such
operations, property and personnel can be vacated from such real property at
Buyers cost consistent with past practice.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, a Seller or one of its Affiliates will license from Buyer
or the Company a portion of the premises for the Leased Real Property
identified on _Schedule 6.15(c)_

to be mutually agreed by Sellers and Buyer, certain material terms of which
are attached hereto as _Exhibit 6.15(c)._

 



 

(d) At the Closing, a Seller or one of its Affiliates will sublease (and, if
the Company is the lessee under the lease for any such location, such lease
shall be assigned to a Seller or one of its Affiliates prior to the Closing)
to Buyer or the Company a portion of the real property identified on _Schedule
6.15(d)_ on the terms set forth therein and otherwise pursuant to a sublease
in a form to be mutually agreed by Sellers and Buyer, certain material terms
of which are attached hereto as _Exhibit 6.15(d)_.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_.
During the period from the Effective Date until the earliest of the Closing
Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Buyer
hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and shall not permit
any of its employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact any
employee (excluding executive officers), customer, supplier or other material
business relation of the Business regarding the Business or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Sellers,
other than those contacts made in the ordinary course and unrelated to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.17 _Non-Competition_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller agrees that for the period from the Closing Date until the
third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage in a business competitive
with the Business anywhere in the United States of America (each, a "
_Competitive Activity_ "); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not prohibit a
Seller or any of its Affiliates from collectively owning up to an aggregate of
five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of any class of capital stock of
any Person that engages in any Competitive Activity (a " _Competing Person_ ")
so long as no Seller nor any of its Affiliates has any participation in the
management of such Competing Person.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 6.17_ shall prohibit a Seller or any of its Affiliates from:

 



 

(i) acquiring the whole or any part of a Person or business which engages in
any Competitive Activity; _provided that_ where such Competitive Activities of
such Person or business represent greater than 25% of the annual revenues as
set out in the latest available annual financial statements of that Person or
business, Sellers and/or their Affiliates shall divest such Person, business
or portion thereof to the extent engaging in such Competitive Activity within
twelve (12) months after the consummation of such acquisition (irrespective of
whether the end of such twelve (12)-month period occurs after the expiration
of the non-compete period); and _provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section
6.17(b)(i)_ shall not restrict acquisitions by (A) HD Supplys "Facilities
Maintenance" business unit of businesses involved in (x) the industrial MRO
(maintenance, repair and operations) industry or (y) HD Supplys "USA Blue Book"
business, in each case solely as part of any reasonable expansion of HD
Supplys "Facilities Maintenance" business unit as currently conducted.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) continuing to engage in the Competitive Activities as currently conducted

(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, solicit for employment any Person who at any time from the
Effective Date to the Closing Date works exclusively for the Business or
becomes a Transferred Employee; provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not apply (i) to solicitations made by job opportunity advertisements and
headhunter searches directed to the general public rather than targeting any

any employee who has been terminated by the Acquired Companies or its
Affiliates more than three (3) months prior to such solicitation.

 



 

(b) Buyer agrees that from and after the Effective Date until the first (1st)

its Affiliates (other than Transferred Employees) and who has had material
contact with Buyer or its Affiliates during the sale process for the Business

months prior to such solicitation or (iii) unrelated portfolio companies that
may be deemed to be an Affiliate of Buyer.

claim. Following the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, upon written notice from Sellers to Buyer, promptly reimburse
Sellers and their respective Affiliates for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs

Affiliates to the extent relating to actions taken pursuant to this _Section
6.19_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.20 _Transition Matters_. Promptly after the Effective Date, and in
any event within fourteen (14) days thereafter, the Parties shall appoint a
transition team to (a) cooperate in good faith to develop a plan for
separating the Business from the other businesses of Sellers and their
Affiliates, including the separation, assignment or replication of any Shared
Contracts at the reasonable request of Buyer pursuant to (and subject to the
terms and conditions of) _Section 6.21_, so as to minimize the adverse impact
of such separation on the Business and Sellers and their Affiliates retained
businesses and (b) prepare and reasonably agree upon the schedules to the
Transition Services Agreement between the Effective Date and the Closing.

 



 

Section 6.21 _Shared Contracts and Assets_.

 



 

(a) To the extent that, following the Effective Date until the one (1) year
anniversary of the Closing, Sellers identify any contracts and agreements
pursuant to which a Person other than Sellers or any of their Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) provides material assets, services, rights
or benefits to Sellers or one or more of their Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) in respect of ( _i_ ) the Business and (ii) one or more
other businesses of any Seller or any of its Affiliates (" _Shared Contracts_
"), Sellers shall notify Buyer of such Shared Contracts. Upon the Buyers
request, with respect to any Shared Contract, Sellers and Buyer shall use, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to ( _x_ ) cause the counterparty to any such Shared Contract to enter
into a new contract with the Company or another designee of Buyer, on terms
substantially similar in all material respects to those contained in such
Shared Contract, in order for the Business to receive the applicable benefits
under such Shared Contract (each such new contract, a " _New Contract_ "), it
being understood that a New Contract may not contain the same terms as the
Shared Contract to which it relates, or ( _y_ ) if practicable, and (subject
to any required third-party consents or notices and any restrictions imposed
by applicable Law), assign to the Company or another designee of Buyer the
benefits and obligations under such Shared Contract to the extent relating to
the Business pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement or otherwise;
provided, that the Company shall not be required to assign the benefits and
obligations under any Shared Contract if doing so could result in the
forfeiture of a privilege. In connection with the entering into of New
Contracts, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that
Sellers and their Affiliates are released by the counterparty with respect to
all liabilities and obligations relating to the Business and arising after the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event will any of the following be considered "Shared Contracts" subject to
this _Section 6.21_: (I) contracts relating to functions marked "None" in the
"description of services" column on Annex A to the Transition Services
Agreement; (II) IT contracts with respect to which only licenses would
transfer as set forth on (and subject to the terms and conditions of) _Exhibit
1.1(a)_ hereto; (III) contracts that are otherwise addressed in Transition
Services Agreement; or (IV) Excluded Assets and Liabilities.

 



 

(b) If the parties are not able, with respect to any such Shared Contract, to
obtain a New Contract or to so assign such Shared Contract prior to the
Closing, then for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing, ( _i_
) Sellers, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such counterparty to enter into a New
Contract or assign to the Company or another designee of Buyer the benefits
and obligations under such Shared Contract as they relate to the Business and
cause the Company or another designee of Buyer to bear the costs and
liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with this Agreement to the extent that the Company or another
designee of Buyer receives the rights and benefits of the parts of the Shared
Contracts that relate to the Business, and ( _ii_ ) until such time as a New
Contract is executed or a Shared Contract is so assigned, Sellers and Buyer
shall use and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use commercially
reasonable efforts to secure an alternative arrangement reasonably
satisfactory to both parties under which the Business would, in compliance
with applicable Law, obtain the benefits and bear the burdens associated with
the applicable Shared Contract such that the Business would be placed in a
substantially similar position as if a New Contract were executed. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer will promptly (or cause the Company to)
pay, perform or discharge when due any liability arising thereunder after the
Closing Date to the extent that the Company or another designee of Buyer
receive the rights and benefits of the parts of such Shared Contracts that
relate to the Business.

 



 

(c) To the extent that, following the Effective Date until the one (1) year
anniversary of the Closing, Sellers identify any material assets (other than
contracts) that are used by both (A) the Business and (B) one or more other
businesses of any Seller or any of its Affiliates (" _Shared Assets_ "),
Sellers shall notify Buyer of such Shared Assets. Upon Buyers request, with
respect to any Shared Assets, Sellers and Buyer shall use, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to make
such Shared Assets available to the Business pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months following the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event will any of the following be considered "Shared Assets" subject to this
_Section 6.21_: (i) Excluded Assets and Liabilities; and (ii) assets
otherwise referenced on _Schedule 3.9_ hereto.

 



 

(d) In no event will Sellers be responsible for, and Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Sellers for, any documented and reasonable out-of-pocket third-party
fees, costs and expenses incurred by Sellers in connection with this _Section
6.21_, including any third-party consent fees. Buyer acknowledges that Sellers
shall have no liability or obligation with respect to any New Contract or
failure to obtain any New Contract.

 



 

Section 6.22 _Further Assurances_. Each of the Parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action,
do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as
may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

prior to the Closing (the " _Termination Date_ "):

 



 

(a) in writing, by mutual consent of Buyer and Sellers;

 



 

(b) by written notice from Buyer to Sellers if any Seller breaches or fails to
perform any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and
such breach or failure causes any of the conditions set forth in _Sections
7.1_ and _7.3_ to have become incapable of fulfillment prior to the End Date
and shall not have been waived in writing by Buyer, so long as Buyer is not
then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement;

 



 

(c) by written notice from Sellers to Buyer if Buyer, Merger Sub, Blocker or
Blocker Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement and such breach or failure causes any
of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ to have become
incapable of fulfillment prior to the End Date and shall not have been waived
in writing by Sellers, so long as Sellers are not then in material breach of
any of their covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by written notice by Buyer or Sellers if the Closing has not occurred on
or prior to December 15, 2017 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Buyer nor Sellers may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(d)_ at any time during which such Party (or with respect to
Buyer, Merger Sub, Blocker or Blocker Merger Sub) is in material breach of any
of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 



 

(e) by written notice from Sellers to Buyer if (i) all of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.3_ were satisfied or waived as of the date the
Closing should have been consummated pursuant to Section 2.5 (other than those
conditions (A) that by their terms are to

 



       
 

 



 

be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing and could have been satisfied
assuming a Closing would occur or (B) for which the failure to be satisfied is
caused by a breach by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement), (ii)
Sellers have notified Buyer in writing that the Sellers are ready, willing and
able to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii)
Buyer, Merger Sub, Blocker or Blocker Merger Sub fails to complete the Closing
within two (2) Business Days after the delivery of such notification.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given by the Party so terminating to the other Parties, and this
Agreement shall terminate and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
abandoned without further action by any Party. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1_:

 



 

(a) each Party shall redeliver all documents, work papers and other materials
of the other Party relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the Party furnishing the
same or, upon prior written notice to such Party, shall destroy all such
documents, work papers and other materials and deliver notice to the Party
seeking destruction of such documents that such destruction has been
completed, and all confidential information received by any Party with respect
to the other Parties shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement and _Section 6.2(b)_;

 



 

(b) all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant hereto
shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from the agency or other Person
to which made;

 



 

(c) there shall be no liability or obligation hereunder on the part of any
Seller, Buyer or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents or representatives except that (i) if the basis of
termination is a willful and material breach by Sellers of one or more of the
provisions of this Agreement, the breaching Party shall be liable to Buyer for
damages resulting from such breach, and (ii) the obligations provided for in
this _Section 8.2_ and _Sections 6.5_ (Public Announcements), _8.3_ (Reverse
Termination Fee), _9.1_ (Fees and Expenses), _9.2_ (Notices), _9.3_
(Severability), _9.7_ (Consent to Jurisdiction), _9.8_ (Waiver of Jury Trial)
and _9.10_ (Governing Law) hereof and in the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any such termination; and

 



 

(d) notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the Confidentiality Agreement will
survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years
following the date of such termination and the term of the Confidentiality
Agreement will be automatically amended to be extended for such additional two
(2) year period.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Reverse Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) Sellers pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_ or (ii) by Sellers or Buyer pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_ at a time when Sellers have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_ but have not exercised that
right, then Buyer shall pay to the Sellers a fee in the aggregate amount of
Two Hundred

 



      
 

 



 

Forty-Five Million Dollars ($245,000,000) (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ "),
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Sellers. The Reverse Termination Fee shall be paid as promptly
as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days
after notice of termination of this Agreement as provided in this _Section
8.3_.

 



 

(b) If Sellers commence an Action against Buyer alleging that Buyer has failed
to pay the Reverse Termination Fee when due, (i) if the Reverse Termination
Fee is ultimately paid by Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Sellers, together with the
Reverse Termination Fee, Sellers reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including outside attorneys fees) incurred in connection with
such Action and (ii) if the Reverse Termination Fee is determined not to be
payable, Sellers shall pay to Buyer, Buyers reasonable, documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including outside attorneys fees) incurred in
connection with such Action. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Sellers
would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto further
acknowledges that the payment by Buyer of the Reverse Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but constitutes liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Sellers in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties
further agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if Buyer fails to effect the Closing for any reason or otherwise
breaches this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder, then, except for an
order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by
_Section 9.12_, Sellers sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Buyer, the Debt Financing
Sources (including the Committed Lenders) and their respective Affiliates or
any of their or their Affiliates former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members, agents or financing
sources (including the Debt Financing Sources) (each, a " _Buyer Related
Party_ ") for any breach, loss or damage shall be to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Article VIII_ and receive full payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee as may be payable hereunder.

 



 

(c) Upon full payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, (i) neither Sellers nor
any of their Affiliates shall be entitled to bring, support or maintain any
Action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute or otherwise) against any Buyer Related Party arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in
connection herewith (including the Commitment Letters) or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination and (ii) each
Seller shall cause any Action pending in connection with this Agreement, any
contract or agreement executed in connection herewith (including the
Commitment Letters) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(or the abandonment or termination thereof), to the extent maintained by
Sellers or any of their Affiliates against any Buyer Related Party, to be
dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business
Days after the full payment of the Reverse Termination Fee. For the avoidance
of doubt, while Sellers may pursue both a grant of specific performance
pursuant to _Section 9.12_ and the full payment of the Reverse Termination
Fee, under no circumstances

 



      
 

 



 

will Sellers be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance (if the Closing actually occurs) and the Reverse Termination Fee.
In no event shall Sellers be entitled to collect the Reverse Termination Fee
on more than one occasion.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
covenants and agrees that Buyer will not (i) commence any Action challenging
the validity or enforceability of any provision of this _Section 8.3_, or
(ii) raise, as a defense, the validity or enforceability of any provision of
this _Section 8.3_, in any Action. Should Buyer violate any aspect of this
_Section 8.3(d)_, Buyer agrees (A) that, in the case of a breach of clause
(i) of the preceding sentence, such claim, lawsuit, demand for arbitration, or
other proceeding shall be summarily withdrawn and/or dismissed; and (B) that
Buyer will pay all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including outside attorneys fees) incurred by Sellers and their Affiliates
in responding to or in connection with a result of such Action, or such
defense, as the case may be.

Section 9.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or

affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.4 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned, directly or indirectly, including by operation of law, by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_
, that Buyer may, without the consent of Sellers, assign the right to acquire
all or part of the Equity Interests and the Additional Transferred Assets to
one or more Affiliates, including one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries, of
Buyer but Buyer shall not be relieved of any of its obligations or liabilities
under this Agreement.

_Section 9.11_, this Agreement is exclusively for the benefit of Sellers, and

obligations of Buyer, Merger Sub, Blocker and Blocker Merger Sub under this
Agreement, and for the benefit of Buyer, Merger Sub, Blocker and Blocker
Merger Sub and their successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the
obligations of Sellers, under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be
deemed to confer upon or give to any other third party any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right; _provided_ , that

Section 9.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) Each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that any Legal Dispute (other than
disputes submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 2.9, Section 2.10
or _Section 6.6(e)_) shall be brought only in the exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Delaware or the federal courts located in the State
of Delaware, and each Party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding that is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. During the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in
accordance with this _Section 9.7(a)_ is pending before a court, all actions,
suits or proceedings with respect to such Legal Dispute or any other Legal
Dispute, including any counterclaim, cross-claim or interpleader, shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court. Each Party hereby waives,
and shall not assert as a defense in any Legal Dispute, that (i) such Party is
not subject thereto, (ii) such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought
or is not maintainable in such court, (iii) such Partys property is exempt or
immune from execution, (iv) such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, or (v) the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is
improper. A final judgment in any action, suit or proceeding described in this
_Section 9.7(a)_ following the expiration of any period permitted for appeal
and subject to any stay during appeal shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Laws.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Seller and each of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives agrees (i) that any action of
any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, involving a Debt Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be brought exclusively in the courts of New York State in New
York County and each Seller submits for itself and its property with respect
to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) not to
bring or permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to bring or support
anyone else in bringing any such action in any other court, (iii) that service
of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at
its address provided in _Section 9.2_ shall be effective service of process
against it for any such action brought in any such court, (iv) to waive and
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in
any such court, (v) that a final judgment in any such action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law, (vi) that any such action shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to
the extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily applicable by statute
and would require or permit the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction and (vii) to irrevocably waive and hereby waives any right to a
trial by jury in any such action to the same extent such rights are waived
pursuant to _Section 9.8_.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT
FINANCING OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Supply
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement and the other documents delivered
pursuant to this Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof) as to all matters, including matters of validity,
construction, effect, performance and remedies.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that King and Spalding LLP (" _K
andS_") has acted as counsel to each of the Acquired Companies and Sellers in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer hereby consents and agrees to, and
agrees to cause each of the Acquired Companies to

 



      
 

 



 

consent and agree to, KandS representing Sellers and any of their Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") after the Closing with respect to
disputes in which the interests of the Seller Parties may be directly adverse
to Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer further consents
and agrees to, and agrees to cause each of the Acquired Companies to consent
and agree to, the communication by KandS to the Seller Parties in connection
with any such representation of any fact known to KandS arising by reason of
KandSs prior representation of the Acquired Companies. In connection with the
foregoing, Buyer hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and
agrees to cause each of the Acquired Companies to waive irrevocably and not to
assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) KandSs
prior representation of the Acquired Companies or the Business and (ii) KandSs
representation of the Seller Parties prior to and after the Closing. Buyer
represents that Buyers attorney has explained and helped Buyer evaluate the
implications and risks of waiving the right to assert a future conflict
against KandS, and Buyers consent with respect to this waiver is fully
informed.

 



 

(b) Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Acquired Companies, that all communications subject to any
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or other similar
protection for the benefit of the Seller Parties, in any form or format
whatsoever between or among KandS, on one hand, and the Acquired Companies, the
Business or in each case any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or other representatives, on the other hand, that relate in any way
to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Privileged Deal Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be
retained and owned collectively by the Seller Parties, shall be controlled by
Sellers on behalf of the Seller Parties and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Buyer, or the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between Buyer or the
Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and a third party other than any Seller,
on the other hand, Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company may assert the
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or other similar
protection for the benefit of the Seller Parties to prevent the disclosure of
the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party; _provided_ , _however_
, that neither Buyer nor any Acquired Company may waive such privilege without
the prior written consent of Sellers, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If Buyer or the Acquired Companies are legally required
by government order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Privileged Deal Communications following the Closing, Buyer
shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify Sellers in writing (including
by making specific reference to this Section) so that Sellers can seek a
protective order and Buyer agrees to use reasonable best efforts, at the
Seller Parties expense, to assist therewith.

 



 

(d) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by KandS that contain
Privileged Deal Communications constitute property of its clients, only the
Seller Parties shall hold such property rights and KandS shall have no duty to
reveal or disclose any Privileged Deal Communications contained in such files
or other materials or any other Privileged Deal Communications by reason of
any attorney-client relationship between KandS, on the one hand, and the
Acquired Companies, on the other hand.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Buyer agrees that it will not, and that it will cause each of the Acquired
Companies not to, use any Privileged Deal Communications against the Seller
Parties in connection with any dispute between Sellers, on the one hand, and
Buyer and the Acquired Companies, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(f) This _Section 9.11_ is for the benefit of KandS and the Seller Parties, and
KandS is an intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section 9.11_. This
_Section 9.11_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 9.11_ may
be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of KandS.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that any breach of the terms of this
Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which money damages would
not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the Parties agree that, in addition
to any other remedies, each Party shall be, subject to the following sentence,
entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement (including Section 2.5 and
_Section 6.8_) or prevent breaches of this Agreement (including Section 2.5
and _Section 6.8_) by a decree or order of specific performance (including
the obligation of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement),
or an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any
Party (including Section 2.5 and _Section 6.8_), without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. It is acknowledged and
agreed that, in the event of a failure or threatened failure of Buyer or its
Affiliates to enforce the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, Sellers shall
be entitled to specific performance to cause Buyer to enforce the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Agreements (including by taking
enforcement action, including seeking specific performance, to cause the Debt
Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing). Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything to the contrary herein, Sellers shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of Buyers obligation to cause the Equity Financing to fund and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement only if (a) Buyer
fails to complete the Closing when required on the Closing Date pursuant to
Section 2.5, (b) the Debt Financing had been funded or will be funded at the
Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (c) Sellers have
irrevocably confirmed that, if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, the Closing will occur. In the event
Sellers are entitled to terminate this Agreement and receive the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, Sellers shall be entitled to,
at their option, seek an injunction or injunctions or specific performance to
enforce the obligations of the Buyer to effect the Closing pursuant to Section
2.5 prior to seeking the Reverse Termination Fee.

 



 

(b) Each Party (i) waives as any defenses in any action for an injunction or
other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, including
the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate, (ii) waives any
requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite
to obtaining an injunction or other appropriate form of specific performance
or equitable relief and (iii) agrees that the only permitted objection that it
may raise in response to any action for an injunction or other appropriate
form of specific performance or equitable relief is that it contests the
existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall
constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail transmission shall
be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of the
Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.14 _Amendment; Modification_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time only by written agreement of the Parties;
_provided_ , that, to the extent any amendment, modification, supplement or
waiver to _Section 8.3_, _Section 9.5_, _Section 9.7(b)_, _Section 9.8_,
_Section 9.14_ and/or _Section 9.18_ (and with respect to any of the
foregoing sections, any of the defined terms used therein) is sought which is
adverse to the rights of any of the Debt Financing Sources, the prior written
consent of the Committed Lenders shall be required before such amendment or
waiver is rendered effective.

 



 

Section 9.15 _Schedules_. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule
hereto referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been disclosed with respect to every other Section in this Agreement to
which such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face to be applicable. The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any
Schedules hereto is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or
lower amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.16 _Non-Survival_.

 



 

(a) None of the representations or warranties of Sellers in this Agreement (or
in any document, certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement) shall survive the Closing, other than the
Surviving Representations. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub, Blocker and Blocker
Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, in the event that the Closing occurs,
no party hereto may bring a claim, suit, action or proceeding against any
Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates based upon or arising out of a breach of
any such representations or warranties other than a breach of the Surviving
Representations.

 



 

(b) The representations and warranties of Buyer, Merger Sub, Blocker and
Blocker Merger Sub in this Agreement (or in any document, certificate or
instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement) shall
not survive the Closing (other than _Section 5.6_ (Solvency), _Section 5.7_
(Independent Review), _Section 5.8_ (Purchase for Investment) and _Section
5.9_ (Certain Fees), which shall survive the Closing).

 



 

(c) The covenants and agreements contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement (or in any document, certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to
or in connection with this Agreement) shall survive the Closing in accordance
with their terms; _provided_ , that Sellers pre-Closing covenants shall
expire on the ten (10) month anniversary of the Closing (other than Sellers
covenants in _Section 6.1(m)_ and _Section 6.6_ which shall survive) unless
Buyer has notified Sellers of a breach of a pre-Closing covenant prior to the
ten (10) month anniversary of

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing, in which case such covenant shall survive until the resolution of
such matter. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub, Blocker and Blocker Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that no party hereto may bring a claim, suit or action
or proceeding against Sellers or any of Sellers Affiliates based upon or
arising out of an immaterial breach of a pre-Closing covenant. Buyer will
promptly reimburse Sellers and their Affiliates in respect of any losses or
liabilities incurred by any Seller or any such Affiliate in respect of the
Assumed Liabilities, and Sellers will promptly reimburse Buyer and its
Affiliates in respect of any losses or liabilities incurred by Buyer or any
such Affiliate (including each of the Acquired Companies) in respect of the
Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

Section 9.17 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

 



 

Section 9.18 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein or otherwise, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the Limited
Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter, this Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made
against the Persons that are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement
in their capacities as such, and, except to the extent otherwise set forth in
the Limited Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter, no former, current or
future stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, agents or
Affiliates of, and any lender to, any party hereto, or any former, current or
future direct or indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person,
director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager,
agent or Affiliate of, and any lender to (including the Debt Financing
Sources), any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have
any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this
Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties
hereto, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the Limited Guarantee or
the Equity Commitment Letter, in no event shall any party or any of its
Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach
of this Agreement against or support any other person to make any such claims,
or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party.

 



 

Section 9.19 _HD Supply Guarantee_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, HD Supply hereby guarantees the full performance of each of
Sellers obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ the liability
of HD Supply under this _Section 9.19_ shall in no event exceed the payment
obligations or liabilities of Sellers under this Agreement and HD Supply may
avail itself of all the defenses and limitations of liability available to
Sellers under this Agreement.
