To the extent any Excluded Liability is assigned or transferred to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company or a Subsidiary) pursuant to this _Section 2.1_, Seller shall, or, if applicable, shall cause such Affiliate to, assume such Excluded Liability. 

  

 2.2 _Purchase of the Shares_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign and deliver the Shares to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and acquire the Shares from Seller, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for restrictions on transfer under federal and state securities Laws. 

  

 2.3 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Shares (the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall be $150,000,000, subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 2.4_, to be paid by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Seller may designate in writing prior to the Closing. 

  

 2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

  

 (a) _Purchaser s Statement; Sellers Review_. No later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (" _Purchaser s Statement_"). Seller shall have a period of the longer of (i) sixty (60) days from the receipt of Purchasers Statement and (ii) one hundred fifty (150) days after the Closing Date (the " _Review Period_ ") to review Purchasers Statement. During the Review Period, Purchaser shall make available to Seller such accounting records of the Company and the Subsidiaries as may be relevant to Sellers review of Purchasers Statement. If as a result of such review, Seller disagrees with Purchasers Statement, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a written notice of disagreement (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") prior to the expiration of the Review Period, specifying in reasonable detail the nature and amount of such disagreement and including Sellers determination of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date. If Seller agrees with Purchasers Statement, Seller shall deliver a written statement to 

   ##### 

  

    

Purchaser within the Review Period accepting Purchasers Statement (an "
_Acceptance Notice_ "), in which case Purchasers Statement shall be final
and binding, effective as of the date on which Purchaser receives the
Acceptance Notice. If Seller does not deliver a Dispute Notice or an
Acceptance Notice within the Review Period, then Purchasers Statement shall
be final and binding, effective as of the first business day after the
expiration of the Review Period. 

  

 (b) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Seller delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser in a timely manner, then Purchaser and Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) days from the date of the Dispute Notice (or such longer period as the parties may mutually agree). If Purchaser and Seller cannot reach agreement within such fifteen (15) day period (or such longer period as they may mutually agree), then Purchaser and Seller shall promptly refer the specific items in dispute to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Independent Auditor_ ") for binding resolution. The Independent Auditor shall work to resolve such dispute promptly and, to the extent practicable, within thirty (30) days from the date the dispute is submitted to the Independent Auditor. The Independent Auditor shall act based solely on the presentations of Purchaser and Seller and not by independent review. Any item not specifically referred to the Independent Auditor for evaluation shall be deemed final and binding on the parties. The Independent Auditor shall deliver to both Purchaser and Seller a written opinion setting forth the final determination of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date calculated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, which shall not be more than as set forth in the Dispute Notice nor less than as set forth in Purchasers Statement. The determination of the Independent Auditor shall be final and binding, effective as of the date the Independent Auditors written opinion is received by Purchaser and Seller. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. 

  

 (c) _Final Settlement_. If the Final Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date is less than the Target Amount (i.e., a larger negative number), then Seller shall, within five (5) business days from the effective date of such final determination, pay to Purchaser the amount of such difference plus an amount computed like simple interest on an annual basis at the prime lending rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal from the Closing Date through the date of payment, such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as Purchaser may designate (or in the absence of any such designation, by corporate check mailed to Purchaser). If the Final Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date is greater than the Target Amount (i.e., a smaller negative number or a positive number), then Purchaser shall, within five (5) business days from the date of such final determination, pay to Seller the amount of such difference plus an amount computed like simple interest on an annual basis at the prime lending rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal from the Closing Date through the date of payment, such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as Seller may designate (or in the absence of any such designation, by corporate check mailed to Seller). Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall be consistently treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price. 

  

 (d) _Certain Employee Bonus Plans_. If the Company would have recorded an accrual as of the Closing Date with respect to an employee bonus plan or program (other than any Change in Control Agreement) of the Company or any Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business, and Purchaser causes any such plan or program to be amended after the Closing to decrease the bonuses payable under such plan or program with respect to the portion 

   ##### 

  

    

of the applicable bonus period ending on the Closing Date, then the accrual
for such bonus plan or program shall be reduced in determining the Final Net
Working Capital as of the Closing Date to reflect the bonus amount that would
have been accrued under such amended plan or program. In no event shall any
such amendment result in any increase in the accrual for the purposes
of determining Final Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date.

of the Purchaser Sponsored Plans. Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that all Purchaser Sponsored Plans provide that (i) any waiting
periods or limitations regarding pre-existing conditions with respect to all

waived, (ii) each Purchaser Sponsored Plan will give each such
Employee credit for such Employees service with the Company prior to the
Closing for purposes of eligibility to participate in Purchaser Sponsored
Plans, and (iii) each Employees vacation and personal time off accrued
through the Closing Date shall continue to be honored after the Closing Date.
Following the Closing, (x) Seller shall be responsible for, and shall
indemnify Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries from and against any

and any claims made or incurred by or related to Employees or Former
Employees and their dependents related to any Seller Benefit Plan, and (y)
Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall hold harmless and indemnify
Seller from, any and all claims incurred by or related to Employees and their
eligible dependents (other than claims related to a Seller Benefit Plan) on

 (b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.6(a)_, effective as of the Closing Date, all Employees shall cease to participate in the Platinum Equity 401(k) Plan (" _Seller s 401(k) Plan_"), and Purchaser shall provide to such Employees the right to participate in a 401(k) plan offered to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or other companies affiliated with Purchaser (any such 401(k) plan is referred to as " _Purchaser s 401(k) Plan_"). Eligible Employees shall receive credit for all service with the Company and any Subsidiary for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not benefit accrual, under Purchasers 401(k) Plan. Effective after the Closing Date, each Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is a participant in Sellers 401(k) Plan shall be entitled to a distribution of his or her account balance in accordance with the terms of Sellers 401(k) Plan as in effect from time to time and applicable Law, and Purchaser shall take any and all action necessary to ensure that Purchasers 401(k) Plan can accept asset rollovers, including "direct rollovers" within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, from Sellers 401(k) Plan subject to Purchasers receipt of reasonable evidence from Seller that Sellers 401(k) Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code as of the time of distribution. 

  

 (c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.6(a)_, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, shall establish a flexible spending account for medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan established or maintained under Section 129 of the Code (" _Purchaser s FSA_"), for each Employee who, on or prior to such date, is a participant in a flexible spending account for medical or dependent care expenses under a Seller Benefit Plan (" _Seller s FSA_"). In a manner agreed by the parties and consistent with Internal Revenue Service Ruling 2002-32, Sellers FSA shall transfer to Purchasers FSA, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Employees account balances and liabilities under Sellers FSA, and Purchasers FSA shall accept responsibility therefore, including responsibility for reimbursement of eligible claims incurred prior to the Closing Date.

Purchaser shall ensure that each Company and each Subsidiary continues to provide short term disability benefits (i.e., salary continuation) to all Employees on short-term disability as of the Closing Date.

No later than ten (10) business days prior to the date on which Seller is required to make any payment under the Participation Plan or under any Change of Control Agreement, Seller shall provide written notice to Purchaser identifying (i) the persons to whom such payments are to be made, (ii) the anticipated payment date and (iii) whether such payment is being made pursuant to the Participation Plan or a Change of Control Agreement. If any such payment is being made pursuant to a Change of Control Agreement and the person to whom such payment is to be made is no longer employed by the Company or a Subsidiary (or an Affiliate) at the time Purchaser receives the notice of the proposed payment, Purchaser shall inform Seller that such person is no longer so employed and shall provide Seller with such additional information as Seller may reasonably request, to enable Seller to determine whether or not such payment is required to be made under the applicable Change of Control Agreement. No later than two business days prior to the proposed payment date, Seller shall transmit to Purchaser (or to the Company or a Subsidiary, as Purchaser may request) the aggregate amount of the payments to be paid, together with a final list of the persons to whom such payments are to be made and the amounts of each such payment, and Purchaser shall pay, or shall cause the Company or a Subsidiary to pay each such payment on the designated payment date. To the extent permitted by applicable Tax Laws, Seller and Purchaser shall treat all payments contemplated by this _Section 5.6(f)_ as compensation paid by Seller for all Tax purposes, and Purchaser (or the Company or any Subsidiary making such payments) shall be treated as a paying agent for Seller. Seller shall be responsible for, and shall hold harmless and indemnify Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary from any Damages incurred by Purchaser arising out of or related to the Change of Control Agreements, including any net Tax liability incurred by Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of the

Company or any Subsidiary arising out of or related to a Change of Control
Agreement.

 5.8 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) For a period of 3 years following the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, operate, engage in, manage, own any equity interest in or be associated with any Person that competes with the business conducted by the Company and the Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing in the United States; _provided_ , _however_ , that this  _Section 5.8(a)_ shall not limit (i) Seller or any Affiliate of Seller from owning a passive ownership interest of less than 5% of the outstanding equity securities in any public traded company or any publicly traded debt securities in any company, or (ii) Seller or any Affiliate of Seller from ownership control of any corporation or enterprise (or interest therein) which derives less than 10% of its total revenues from a business that competes with the business conducted by the Company and the Subsidiaries.

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Seller acknowledges and agrees that compliance with the covenants contained in this  _Section 5.8_ is necessary to protect the value of the goodwill being acquired by Purchaser and that these covenants are reasonable for such purposes. If any provision contained in this  _Section 5.8_ shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this  _Section 5.8_, but this _Section 5.8_ shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained in this _Section 5.8_ is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extant invalid, such provision shall be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this  _Section 5.8_ to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable Law. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller agrees that Purchaser shall be entitled to (i) seek injunctive relief requiring specific performance by Seller of this  _Section 5.8_ without the necessity of proving actual damages or the posting of a bond and (ii) seek from time to time any other remedies available under applicable Law against Seller if Seller is directly or indirectly in breach of or has breached this _Section 5.8_. 

  

 5.9 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_. For a period of not less than six years after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company and the Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law against Damages arising out of claims brought or made by third parties based on the actions of such persons in their capacities as officers, directors, employees or agents of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Closing, and (ii) maintain in full force and effect and honor, all obligations to indemnify the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company and the Subsidiaries and to advance expenses existing in favor of such persons in effect as of the Closing Date under Delaware Law or as provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company or any Subsidiary or in any written agreement set forth in _Section 5.9 of the Disclosure Schedules_. 

  

 5.10 _Further Assurances_. Each party will execute, acknowledge and deliver such documents and instruments reasonably requested by the other party, and will take any other action consistent with the terms of this Agreement that may reasonably be requested by the other party, for the purpose of giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if, at any time, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including the Company or any Subsidiary, acquires any asset that constitutes an Excluded Asset (for example, any funds released from the escrow established under the Disability Business Sale Agreement), then Purchaser shall, or shall cause such Affiliate to, immediately pay over or deliver such asset to Seller. Seller shall use, and Seller shall cause the management of Seller and the Company to use, commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in all reasonable and customary respects with Purchaser and Purchasers agents to facilitate the consummation of the financing contemplated by the Financing Documents (the expense of such cooperation to be borne by Purchaser including without limitation, the preparation of any customary offering 

   ##### 

  

    

memorandum, making available any audited or unaudited financial statements as
would customarily be provided in connection with similar financings, and any
customary marketing efforts necessary in connection with the financing). 

  

 5.11 _Bonds; Letters of Credit; Guarantee_. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate, or obtain a release of Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller) from, each of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees listed in _Section 5.11 of the Disclosure Schedule_ (each, a " _Seller Credit Enhancement_ ") prior to the Closing. To the extent that any Seller Credit Enhancement has not been terminated or released as of the Closing, (i) such Seller Credit Enhancement shall remain in place following the Closing until terminated or released, (ii) Purchaser shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate or obtain a release of such Seller Credit Enhancement as soon as practicable after the Closing, (iii) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller (and its Affiliates) harmless from and against any losses or liabilities incurred under any such Seller Credit Enhancement, provided that this will in no way limit the rights of Purchaser to indemnification pursuant to Article X, and (iv) Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any Subsidiary, to increase in amount or extend in duration any obligation secured or supported by such Seller Credit Enhancement unless and until such Seller Credit Enhancement is terminated or released. Upon the termination or release of any Seller Credit Enhancement at any time, any cash or other collateral related to such Seller Credit Enhancement shall be paid over to Seller. 

  

 5.12 _Pre-Closing Cash Distributions_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller may cause the Company or any Subsidiary to distribute, pay or otherwise transfer any cash or cash equivalents to Seller or to any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company or a Subsidiary) at any time prior to the Closing. 

  

 5.13 _No Solicitation by Seller_. Seller shall not, nor shall it permit the Company or any Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its or the Companys and Subsidiarys directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information) the making of any proposal or offer (A) relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any portion of the capital stock of the Company or its assets (other than assets to be sold in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), (B) to enter into any merger, consolidation or other business combination with the Company or (C) to enter into a recapitalization, reorganization or any other extraordinary business transaction involving or otherwise relating to the Company or (ii) participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to do any of the foregoing. Seller immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly if any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made and shall, in any such notice to Purchaser, indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including the rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to indemnification under this  _Article X_, Sellers indemnification obligations to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be limited as follows: 

  

 (i) The aggregate amount of Sellers liability for breach of the representations and warranties in _Article III_ other than breaches of the Specified Representations shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price;

Indemnifying Party to take appropriate action to resist such claim. Such
notice shall specify in reasonable detail all facts and circumstances known
to the Indemnified Party regarding the claim and shall explain in reasonable
detail the basis on which the Indemnified Party claims a right to indemnity,
including citation to relevant sections of this Agreement, and, if estimable,

provide such notice shall not result in a waiver of any right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party shall be duly
notified of such indemnity claim, the parties shall attempt to settle and
compromise the same, or if unable to do so within sixty (60) days of the
Indemnified Partys delivery of notice of indemnity claim, the parties may
seek arbitration in accordance with Section 12.3. Any rights of
indemnification established by reason of such settlement or arbitration
proceeding shall thereafter be paid and satisfied by the Indemnifying Party
promptly after such date that the indemnified amount is finally determined.

Upon receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a notice from the Indemnified Party with respect to any claim of a third party against the Indemnified Party, for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such claim, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate to the extent reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend all such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith. If the Indemnifying Party shall elect to assume the defense of such claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any claim against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle any claim for which indemnification has been sought and is available hereunder; provided that, to the extent that such settlement requires the Indemnified Party to take, or prohibits the Indemnified Party from taking, any action or purports to obligate the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall not settle such claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a third party claim and disputes the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume control of the defense of such claim through counsel of its choice, the reasonable costs of which shall be at the Indemnifying Partys expense in the event that the Indemnified Partys right of indemnification is ultimately established through settlement, compromise or other legal proceeding. In no circumstance may the Indemnified Party compromise or settle a claim with a third party for which it seeks indemnification from the Indemnifying Party without first obtaining the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

 (f) _Control of Certain Proceedings_. The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) Seller shall be responsible for the handling of all matters related to the Excluded Liabilities and the Excluded Assets (including, without limitation, the prosecution and defense of any proceedings related thereto, if applicable) without any requirement that Purchaser or the Company give any further notice thereof, (ii) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not have the right to retain separate counsel at Sellers expense in connection with any such matter (it being agreed that Seller shall bear the fees and expenses of 

   ##### 

  

    

the counsel presently engaged in each such matter), and (iii) Seller shall
have the exclusive right to control the payment, settlement, negotiation and
other treatment of all such matters; provided, however, that, to the extent
that any such settlement includes any agreement by Purchaser, the Company or
any Subsidiary to take, or prohibits Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary
from taking, any action that will not be fully performed by Seller or imposes
any post-settlement obligation on Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary
that will not be fully satisfied by Seller, then Seller may not enter into
such settlement without the prior written consent of Purchaser, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In connection with
any such matter, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall provide all
reasonable support and assistance to Seller, its Affiliates and
Representatives, as they may reasonably request (including, without
limitation, access to personnel and information); _provided_ _,_   _however_
, that, (i) Seller shall reimburse any out-of-pocket expenses (but no
internal charges for Purchaser or Company personnel providing such
assistance) incurred in providing such support and assistance and (ii) such
requests for assistance shall not unreasonably interfere with or disrupt the
operation of Purchasers or the Companys business. 

  

 10.3 _Mitigation_. An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain recovery from third parties other than the Indemnifying Party hereunder (including, without limitation, any insurance company or other insurance provider) who may be legally responsible to reimburse such Indemnified Party for any Damages. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the amount of any Damages of any Person under this _Article X_ shall be net of (a) the amount, if any, received by the Indemnified Party from any third party (including, without limitation, any insurance company or other insurance provider), which third party recoveries the Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain, and (b) the amount, if any, equal to the Tax benefit (such amounts being collectively referred to herein as a " _Third Party Reimbursement_ "), in respect of or attributable to the Damages suffered thereby. If, after receipt by the Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder, such Indemnified Party receives a Third Party Reimbursement in respect of the same Damages for which indemnification was made and such Third Party Reimbursement was not taken into account in assessing the amount of indemnification, then the Indemnified Party shall turn over all of such Third Party Reimbursement to the Indemnifying Party up to the amount of the indemnification paid pursuant hereto. 

  

 10.4 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for claims for fraud or intentional misrepresentation under applicable law and for the provisions of Section 8.2 and Article XI, the indemnification provided in this _Article X_ will constitute the exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, and their respective assigns from and against any and all Damages asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred or suffered by, any of them, directly or indirectly, as a result of, or based upon or arising from the breach of any representation or warranty or the non-fulfillment of any agreement or covenant in or pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement, document, or instrument required hereunder. Purchaser and Seller each hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims, and causes of action it may have against any other party, or any of such other partys Affiliates, to the contrary. 

  

 10.5 _Damages_. Each party agrees that it is not entitled to recover and hereby waives any claim with respect to, and will not seek, lost profit, exemplary, incidental, punitive or 

   ##### 

  

    

any other special Damages or consequential Damages that were not reasonably
foreseeable as to any matter under, relating to or arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 10.6 _Other Limitations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to provide indemnification to any Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages suffered by such Indemnified Party if such Damages have already been paid by an insurance company or another third party or if another Indemnified Party has already been paid with respect to such Damages hereunder, (ii) if a matter for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement is reserved for or accrued in connection with the determination of the Final Net Working Capital, then no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be able to recover for such matter to the extent it was so reserved for or accrued, and (iii) no Seller Indemnified Party shall be liable for any Damages to the extent that such Damages arose from actions taken by or omitted to be taken by Purchaser or, after the Closing Date, by the Company or any Subsidiary (except to the extent that (i) such Damages arise from the continuation of actions taken by or omitted to be taken by Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary that constituted a breach of a representation or warranty made by Seller in _Article III_ as of the Closing Date and (ii) none of Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary had Knowledge of such breach at the time that such actions continued to be taken or omitted to be taken following the Closing Date). 

  

 10.7 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Any payments made pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be consistently treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all purposes by Seller and Purchaser. 

  

ARTICLE XI 
  _TAX MATTERS_  

   

 11.1 _Responsibility for Taxes_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall be responsible for: (i) all Taxes imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary, or for which the Company or any Subsidiary may otherwise be liable as a transferee or Successor, by contract or under Treas. Reg. §1.502-6 (or any similar or corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Law), for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date; (ii) the portion of all Taxes imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary, or for which the Company or any Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date, to the extent that such Taxes are attributable to the operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the year or period ending on the Closing Date as provided in  _Section 11.1(c)_; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 11.1(b)_ , any Taxes resulting from the transactions involving the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities. Seller shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes received for any period (or partial period) ending prior to or on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not be responsible or liable for any Taxes which have been accrued as a liability, and shall not receive any refund which has been included as an asset, in the Final Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) Purchaser shall be responsible for (without any right to be reimbursed by Seller): (i) all Taxes imposed on Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary, or 

   ##### 

  

    

for which Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary may otherwise be liable,
for any taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date; (ii) the
portion of all Taxes imposed on Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary, or
for which Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary may otherwise be liable,
for any taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date, to the extent that such Taxes are attributable to the year or
period beginning after the Closing Date as provided in _Section 11.1(c)_;
(iii) any additional Taxes imposed on Seller or the Company resulting from
any transaction engaged in by the Company or any Subsidiary occurring after
the Closing (including any deemed sale of assets); and (iv) any and all
transfer, stamp, real property transfer, document, bulk sale or similar Taxes
payable in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein. Purchaser shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes of the Company
received for any periods (or partial periods) beginning after the Closing
Date. 

  

 (c) For purposes of _Section 11.1(a)_ and _Section 11.1(b)_, whenever it is necessary to determine the responsibility for Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of a portion of a taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination of the Taxes for the portion of the taxable year or period ending on, and the portion of the taxable year or period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property, by assuming that the Company and the Subsidiaries had a taxable year or period that ended at the close of the Closing Date and closing the books of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of such date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis; and, (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i) that are imposed on a periodic basis and measured by the level of any item, by taking the amount of such Taxes (including any minimum) for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date or the number of calendar days in the period beginning after the Closing Date, as applicable, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. 

  

 (d) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate, and Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by another party, in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns. Such cooperation shall include the retention and provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Returns. 

  

 (e) If Seller is liable pursuant to this _Section 11.1_ for any Taxes due and to be paid by Purchaser, Seller shall pay to Purchaser, or if Purchaser is liable pursuant to this _Section 11.1_ for any Taxes due and to be paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates, Purchaser shall pay to Seller at least five (5) business days before the date on which such Taxes are due and payable an amount equal to the Taxes for which Seller is liable, or the Taxes for which Purchaser is liable, as applicable. If Seller or any of its Affiliates receive any refund of Taxes to which Purchaser is entitled pursuant to this _Section 11.1_, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such refund within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such refund by Seller or any of its Affiliates. If Purchaser receives any refund of Taxes to which Seller is entitled pursuant to this 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 11.1_, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such refund
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such refund by Purchaser. 

  

 11.2 _Tax Returns and Contests_. 

  

 (a) The Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries required to be filed for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date (including any Tax Return for the short period ending on the Closing Date), that are required to be filed after the Closing Date shall be prepared and filed by Seller or its Affiliates at the expense of Seller. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries filed before the Closing Date for prior fiscal periods unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, in preparing such Tax Returns, Seller shall be required to consult in good faith with Purchaser regarding any change in any Tax accounting practice, policy or method and the making or revocation of any election relating to Taxes, except for any actions described on Schedule 5.2(vi) of the Disclosure Schedule. To the extent that the operations of the Company reflected on such Tax Returns are required to be included in the Tax Return of Seller and its Affiliates, Seller or such Affiliates, as the case may be, shall cause the operations of the Company to be so included. Any officer of the Company or any Subsidiary as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date shall have the authority, and by execution of this Agreement Purchaser hereby grants any such officer the authority, to sign any of such Tax Returns. 

  

 (b) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed at its expense any Tax Returns of Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary required to be filed separately or as part of a consolidated Tax Return for all periods that end after the Closing Date (including periods that begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date), which are filed after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries filed before the Closing Date for prior fiscal periods unless Purchaser reasonably determines that there is a material risk of penalties. Such Tax Returns that include any period or portion of a period including the Closing Date as are required to be filed separately or as a part of a consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return of Purchaser and its Affiliates (but not any consolidated Tax Return) shall be submitted to Seller at least fifteen (15) days before the first date on which such Tax Returns are legally required to be filed, including extensions, to enable Seller to review, comment on and approve such Tax Returns (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in connection with Sellers review of such Tax Returns and provide to Seller such additional information related to the operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries as Seller shall reasonably request in connection with such review. Purchaser and Seller shall consult with each other in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of such review and approval. 

  

 (c) Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or the Company of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign income or franchise Tax audits or assessments that may affect the Tax liabilities of Seller or Tax liability for which Seller may be required to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Seller shall have the sole and exclusive right, power and authority, at its expense, to negotiate, resolve, settle, or contest any notice of audit or assessment referred to in _Section 11.2(c)_ and to represent and act for and on behalf of Seller, Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries in connection with any such audit or assessment, including refund claims of any Tax liability for any period ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of the progress thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not resolve, settle, compromise, or abandon any issue or claim without the prior written consent of Purchaser if such action would materially and adversely affect the Tax liabilities of Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary in any period after the Closing Date (including the imposition of any income Tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis on cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of amortization or depreciation deductions or the reduction of loss or credit carryforwards). Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and shall not be necessary if Seller has fully indemnified Purchaser against the effects of any such action. 

  

ARTICLE XII 
  _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_  

   

 12.1 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules hereto, and the Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement referred to in _Section 5.4_ above, sets forth the entire agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, written or oral, between the parties or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to such subject matter. 

  

 12.2 _Governing Law_. The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement, and any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by the Laws of the State of New York, without regard to the Laws of such State as to choice or conflict of Laws. 

  

 12.3 _Arbitration_. 

  

 (a) Any controversy, claim, or question of interpretation in dispute between Seller, on one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand (Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, each being referred to as a "party") arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof (except such as may arise under or with respect to Section 2.4(b), which shall be finally determined by the Independent Auditor) shall be finally settled by arbitration in New York, New York, under the then-effective International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration as modified by this Agreement, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any federal or state court in the State of New York having jurisdiction. The award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties and not subject to further appeal. Such arbitration can be initiated by written notice by either party (the " _Claimant_ ") to the other party, which notice shall identify the Claimants selected arbitrator. The party receiving such notice (the " _Respondent_ ") shall identify its arbitrator within ten (10) business days following its receipt of such notice. The arbitrator selected by the Claimant and the arbitrator selected by the Respondent shall, within fifteen (15) business days of their appointment, select a third neutral arbitrator. In the event that they are unable to do so, either party may request the International 

   ##### 

  

    

Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution to appoint the third neutral
arbitrator. All three arbitrators selected pursuant to this Section 12.3
shall be persons listed on the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals. The
arbitrators shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a
court in New York could order or grant, including, without limitation,
specific performance of any obligation created under this Agreement, the
issuance of injunctive or other provisional relief, or the imposition of
sanctions for abuse or frustration of the arbitration process.
The arbitration award will be in writing and specify the factual and legal
basis for the award. 

  

 (b) It is the intent of the parties that any arbitration shall be concluded as quickly as reasonably practicable. Unless the parties otherwise agree, once commenced, the hearing on the disputed matters shall be held four days a week until concluded, with each hearing date to begin at 9:00 a.m. and to conclude at 5:00 p.m. The arbitrators shall use all reasonable efforts to issue the final award or awards within a period of five business days after closure of the proceedings. Failure of the arbitrators to meet the time limits of this Section 12.3(b) shall not be a basis for challenging the award. 

  

 (c) The arbitrators shall instruct the non-prevailing party to pay all costs of the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of the prevailing party. If the arbitrators determine that there is not a prevailing party, each party shall be instructed to bear its own costs and to pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators. 

  

 (d) Each party hereto hereby agrees that any legal proceeding instituted to enforce an arbitration award hereunder will be brought in the U.S. federal or state courts situated in New York, and hereby submits to personal jurisdiction therein and irrevocably waives any objection as to venue therein, and further agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereby (x) consents to service of process in any such action in any manner permitted by New York Law; (y) agrees that service of process made in accordance with clause (x) or made by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to _Section 12.11_ will constitute good and valid service of process in any such action; and (z) waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such action any claim that service of process made in accordance with clause (x) or (y) does not constitute good and valid service of process. 

  

 12.4 _Schedules_. The inclusion of any information in any Schedule attached hereto will not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in such Schedule, that such information is required to be listed in such Schedule. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of the Schedules are inserted for convenience only and will not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Schedules are arranged in sections corresponding to the sections of this Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one Schedule as an exception to a particular covenant, representation or warranty will be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other covenants, representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such other covenants, representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an 

   ##### 

  

    

appropriate Schedule with respect to such other covenants, representations or
warranties or an appropriate cross-reference thereto. 

  

 12.5 _Waiver and Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented, modified and/or rescinded only through an express written instrument signed by all parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any party may specifically and expressly waive in writing any portion of this Agreement or any breach hereof, but only to the extent such provision is for the benefit of the waiving party, and no such waiver shall constitute a further or continuing waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision. The consent by one party to any act for which such consent was required shall not be deemed to imply consent or waiver of the necessity of obtaining such consent for the same or similar acts in the future, and no forbearance by a party to seek a remedy for noncompliance or breach by another party shall be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy with respect to such noncompliance or breach. 

  

 12.6 _Amendment to Schedules_. Seller may, from time to time prior to the Closing, by notice in accordance with this Agreement, propose to supplement or amend any Schedule to this Agreement (the " _Disclosure Supplement_ ") (i) with respect to any fact, change, condition or circumstance that occurs after the date of this Agreement which, if existing or occurring before or at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Schedules or (ii) with respect to any fact that existed as of the date of this Agreement, to correct any disclosures that were inaccurately made or to add any disclosures that were inaccurately omitted. With respect to any fact, change, condition or circumstance described in clause (i) above, (x) if the fact, change, condition or circumstance contained in the Disclosure Supplement would cause the condition contained in _Section 6.1_ not to be met, then Purchaser must either terminate this Agreement or accept such Disclosure Supplement as an amendment to the Disclosure Schedule and (y) if the fact, change, condition or circumstance contained in the Disclosure Supplement would not cause the condition contained in _Section 6.1_ not to be met, then Purchaser may seek any indemnification available to Purchaser under this Agreement following the Closing with respect to such fact, change, condition or circumstance; provided, however, that, Purchaser shall not be entitled to seek indemnification with respect to any such fact, change, condition or circumstance under this Agreement that occurs in the ordinary course of the Companys business and was not the result of actions taken in violation of _Section 5.2_ (it being understood and agreed that the threat or the commencement of litigation in the ordinary course will, among other matters, be exempted from any indemnification obligation pursuant to clause (y)). With respect to any items of the type described in clause (ii) above, if the fact, change, condition or circumstance contained on the Disclosure Supplement would not prevent the fulfillment of the condition contained in _Section 6.1_, or if such fact, change, condition or circumstance would prevent the fulfillment of the condition contained in _Section 6.1_ but the parties still allow the Closing to occur, Purchaser may seek any indemnification available to Purchaser under this Agreement following Closing with respect to such fact, change, condition or circumstance. 

  

 12.7 _Assignment_. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any interest herein shall be assignable (voluntarily, involuntarily, by judicial process, operation of Law or otherwise), in whole or in part, by any party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such attempted assignment shall be null and 

   ##### 

  

    

void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 12.7 shall
prevent Purchaser, without the consent of any other party, from assigning all
or part of its rights or obligations hereunder by way of collateral
assignment to any lender(s) providing financing for the
transactions contemplated hereby or to any of its Affiliates, but no such
assignment shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 12.8 _Successors and Assigns_. Each of the terms, provisions and obligations of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the parties and their respective legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 12.9 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as giving any Person, other than the parties to this Agreement and their successors and permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under, or in respect of, this Agreement or any provision hereof. 

  

 12.10 _No Personal Liability_. This Agreement shall not create or be deemed to create or permit any personal liability or obligation on the part of (i) any direct or indirect stockholder, member or partner of Seller or Purchaser or (ii) any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of Seller, Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary. 

  

 12.11 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications made under this Agreement shall be in writing, correctly addressed to the recipient as follows:

shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) upon delivery, if served
personally on the party to whom notice is to be given, (ii) on the date of
receipt, refusal or non-delivery indicated on the receipt if mailed to the

 12.12 _Severability_. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Law and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any term or provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction: (a) a substitute and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction, the intent and purpose of the invalid, prohibited or unenforceable provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity, prohibition or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, prohibition or unenforceability of such provision affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 12.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute a single agreement.

   ##### 

  

    

facsimile signature page or at any time thereafter upon request; _provided_
,  _however_ , that the failure to deliver any such originally executed
