business days from the effective date of such final determination, pay to Purchaser the amount of
such difference plus an amount computed like simple interest on an annual basis at the prime
lending rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal from the Closing Date through the date of

the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Tax Returns

Purchaser reasonably determines that there is a material risk of penalties. Such Tax Returns that
include any period or portion of a period including the Closing Date as are required to be filed

correct any disclosures that were inaccurately made or to add any disclosures that were
inaccurately omitted. With respect to any fact, change, condition or circumstance described in
clause (i)&nbsp;above, (x)&nbsp;if the fact, change, condition or circumstance contained in the Disclosure
Supplement would cause the condition contained in <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> not to be met, then Purchaser
must either terminate this Agreement or accept such Disclosure Supplement as an amendment to the
Disclosure Schedule and (y)&nbsp;if the fact, change, condition or circumstance contained in the
Disclosure Supplement would not cause the condition contained in <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> not to be met,
then Purchaser may seek any indemnification available to Purchaser under this Agreement following
the Closing with respect to such fact, change, condition or circumstance; provided, however, that,
Purchaser shall not be entitled to seek indemnification with respect to any such fact, change,
condition or circumstance under this Agreement that occurs in the ordinary course of the Company&#146;s
business and was not the result of actions taken in violation of <U>Section&nbsp;5.2</U> (it being
understood and agreed that the threat or the commencement of litigation in the ordinary course
will, among other matters, be exempted from any indemnification obligation pursuant to clause (y)).
With respect to any items of the type described in clause (ii)&nbsp;above, if the fact, change,
condition or circumstance contained on the Disclosure Supplement would not prevent the fulfillment
of the condition contained in <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U>, or if such fact, change, condition or
circumstance would prevent the fulfillment of the condition contained in <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> but
the parties still allow the Closing to occur, Purchaser may seek any indemnification available to
Purchaser under this Agreement following Closing with respect to such fact, change, condition or
circumstance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.12 <U>Severability</U>. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of
this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Law and public policies
applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any term or provision
of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is adjudicated by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction: (a)
a substitute and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as
may be valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction, the intent and purpose of the invalid,
prohibited or unenforceable provision; and (b)&nbsp;the remainder of this Agreement and the application
of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity,
prohibition or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, prohibition or unenforceability of such
provision affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly
drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

agreement.

any instrument to be drafted.

page is required by Law) may be executed by delivery of a facsimile copy of an executed signature
