AGREEMENTS

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and legal sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties undertake and agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 
DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS

1.1 Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not defined in
the body of this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Exhibit
A.

1.2 Interpretations. In this Agreement, unless a clear contrary intention
appears: (a) the singular includes the plural and vice versa; (b) reference to
a Person includes such Person's successors and assigns but, in the case of a
Party, only if such successors and assigns are permitted by this Agreement,
and reference to a Person in a particular capacity excludes such Person in any
other capacity; (c) reference to any gender includes each other gender; (d)
references to any Exhibit, Schedule, Section, Article, Annex, subsection and
other subdivision refer to the corresponding Exhibits, Schedules, Sections,
Articles, Annexes, subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless
expressly provided otherwise; (e) references in any Section or Article or
definition to any clause means such clause of such Section, Article or
definition; (f) "hereunder," "hereof," "hereto" and words of similar import
are references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement; (g) the word "or" is not exclusive, and the word
"including" (in its various forms) means "including without limitation"; (h)
each accounting term not otherwise defined in this Agreement has the meaning
commonly applied to it in accordance with GAAP; (i) references to "days" are
to calendar days; and (j) all references to money refer to the lawful currency
of the United States. The Table of Contents and the Article and Section titles
and headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only
and are not intended to be a part of, or to affect the meaning or
interpretation of, this Agreement.

ARTICLE II 
CONTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRIBUTED ASSETS

2.1 Contribution of the Contributed Assets. At the Closing, on the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, (a) Azure shall cause its
Subsidiaries to contribute, transfer, convey and deliver to certain
Subsidiaries of Marlin all of Azure's and its Subsidiaries' right, title and
interest in and to the Contributed Assets, free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens), in exchange for the consideration set forth in Section
2.2 and (b) Marlin and its Subsidiaries shall purchase, assume and accept the
Contributed Assets and the TGG Assumed Liabilities with respect thereto.

2.2 Consideration for the Contributed Assets. At the Closing, in consideration
for the contribution of the Contributed Assets, Marlin shall (a) issue to
Azure 90 IDR Units (the 



"Contribution Interests"); and (b) pay to Azure $99,500,000.00 in cash (the
"Contribution Cash Consideration"), payable by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Azure. The Contribution Cash
Consideration and the Contribution Interests are collectively referred to
herein as the "Marlin Contribution Consideration." To the maximum extent
permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d), the Parties agree to
treat the payment of the Contribution Cash Consideration made pursuant to this
Section 2.2 as received by Azure in reimbursement of pre-formation capital
expenditures.

2.3 Certain Prorations.

(a) Except as provided in Section 2.3(b) below, all prepaid expenses and
deposits, and all expenses for which liability has accrued, but whose payment
is not yet due as of Closing (including (i) utility deposits and charges,
including electricity, water and sewer charges and (ii) transferable business
and license fees, including any retroactive adjustments thereof), shall be
prorated and adjusted between Azure and Marlin in accordance with the
principle that Azure shall be entitled to all revenues and responsible for all
expenses allocable to the conduct of the Legacy Business up to 11:59 p.m. on
the day before the Closing Date, and Marlin shall be entitled to all revenues
and shall be responsible for all expenses allocable to the conduct of the
Legacy Business on or after 12:00 a.m. on the Closing Date; provided, however,
that this Section 2.3(a) shall not apply to Taxes. If the actual amounts to be
prorated are not known as of the Closing Date, the prorations shall be made on
the basis of the best evidence then available, and thereafter, within thirty
(30) days after actual amounts are known, a cash settlement will be made
between Azure and Marlin.

(b) The following items shall be prorated as of the Closing Date with all
items of income and expense for the Azure Property being borne by Marlin from
and after (and including) the Closing Date and such items being borne by Azure
for all time periods prior to the Closing Date: fees and assessments; real and
personal ad valorem Taxes; and any assessments by private covenant for the
then-current calendar year of Closing. If any of such Taxes, fees or
assessments for the year of Closing are not known or cannot be reasonably
estimated, such amounts shall be prorated based on such equivalent Taxes, fees
or assessments for the year prior to Closing, subject to a final true-up
within thirty (30) days after actual amounts are known, in which case a cash
settlement(s) will be made between Azure and Marlin.

(c) Marlin shall take all steps necessary to effectuate the transfer of all
utilities used in the Legacy Business to the name of the appropriate Marlin
Party as of the Closing Date, and where necessary, post deposits with the
utility companies. Azure shall ensure that all utility meters used in the
Legacy Business are read as of the Closing Date. Azure shall be credited by
Marlin for the portion of any and all deposits held by any utility company
that relate to the conduct of the Legacy Business on after 12:00 a.m. on the
Closing Date. If the actual amounts to be credited are not known as of the
Closing Date, then credits shall be made on the basis of the best evidence
then available, 



and thereafter, within thirty (30) days after actual amounts are known, a cash
settlement will be made between Azure and Marlin.

(d) The provisions of this Section 2.3 shall survive the Closing.

2.4 Purchase Price Allocation. The Marlin Contribution Consideration, the TGG
Assumed Liabilities and other relevant items shall be allocated among the
Contributed Assets in accordance with their fair market values as reasonably
determined by Marlin GP and Azure in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Allocation"). Marlin GP shall,
within sixty days following the Closing, initially prepare and deliver to the
Conflicts Committee and Azure for their respective review and approval (a) the
Allocation and (b) a draft Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, Asset
Acquisition Statement under Code Section 1060 (and any comparable forms
required to be filed under state, local or foreign Tax Law) and any additional
data or materials required to be attached to Form 8594 pursuant to the
Treasury Regulations promulgated under Code Section 1060 (the "Asset
Allocation Statement"). If Azure or the Conflicts Committee does not timely
notify Marlin GP of any objection to the Asset Allocation Statement, then it
shall be deemed agreed to by Azure and the Asset Allocation Statement shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Azure and the Marlin Parties. In the event
Azure reasonably objects to the manner in which the Asset Allocation Statement
has been prepared, Azure shall notify Marlin GP and the Conflicts Committee
within twenty-one days of receipt of the Asset Allocation Statement of such
objection, and Marlin GP, the Conflicts Committee and Azure shall endeavor in
good faith to resolve such dispute within the next ten days. If the Parties
are unable to resolve such dispute within said ten day period, Marlin GP and
Azure shall submit such dispute to the Independent Accountant. Promptly, but
not later than ten days after its acceptance of appointment hereunder, the
Independent Accountant shall determine (based solely on representations of
Marlin GP and Azure and not upon independent review) only those matters in
dispute and will render a written report as to the disputed matters and the
resulting preparation of the Asset Allocation Statement shall be conclusive
and binding upon the Marlin Parties and Azure. Fifty percent (50%) of the
costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by Marlin, and
the remainder of such costs and expenses shall be borne by Azure. The Marlin
Parties and Azure agree (i) to file the final Asset Allocation Statement as
well as any similar state or local form consistently with the Allocation, in
each case as agreed, and (ii) that neither Marlin GP nor Azure or any of their
respective Affiliates or direct or indirect owners shall take a position on

examination of a Tax Return or in any judicial proceeding, that is in any
manner inconsistent with the terms of the Allocation, except as required by
applicable Law.

2.5 Quarterly Distributions for the IDR Units. Azure shall pay or cause to be
paid to IDRH all distributions on the Contribution Interests declared and made

pro rata share of such distributions that relate to the fiscal quarter of
Marlin in 



which the Closing Date occurs, which shall be determined based on the number
of days between and including the first date of such quarter and the Closing
Date. Such payment or payments shall be made no later than five Business Days
following the receipt by Azure, any of its Affiliates or successors, or any
transferee of the Contribution Interests of such distributions. Marlin shall

distributions between Azure and IDRH, which obligation shall be solely between
Azure and IDRH.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF AZURE

Azure hereby represents and warrants to the Marlin Parties as of the Execution
Date and the Closing Date as follows:

5.1 Organization; Qualification. Each Azure Party is an entity duly formed,

organization. Each Azure Party has full partnership or limited liability
company, as applicable, power and authority to own and hold the properties and
assets it now owns and holds and to carry on its business as and where such
properties are now owned or held and such business is now conducted. Each
Azure Party is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign
partnership or limited liability company, as applicable, and is in good
standing in the states in which the character of the properties and assets now
owned or held by it or the nature of the business now conducted by it requires
it to be so licensed or qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified
or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Legacy Material
Adverse Effect. Azure has made available to Marlin true and complete copies of
the Organizational Documents of Talco as in effect on the Execution Date.

5.2 Authority; Enforceability.

(a) Each Azure Party has the requisite limited liability company or limited
partnership power and authority to execute and deliver the Transaction
Documents to which it is, or will be, a party, to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby and to perform all the terms and conditions thereof to be
performed by it. The execution and delivery by each Azure Party of the
Transaction Documents to which such Azure Party is, or will be, a party, the
consummation by such Azure Party of the transactions contemplated thereby and
the performance by each Azure Party of all of the terms and conditions thereof
to be performed by it have been duly and validly authorized by such Azure
Party, and no other proceedings on the part of such Azure Party are necessary
to authorize the Transaction Documents to which it is, or will be, a party, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which
it is, or will be, a party or to perform all of the terms and conditions
thereof to be performed by it. 



(b) The Transaction Documents to which each Azure Party is, or will be, a
party have been (or will be, when executed and delivered at the Closing) duly
executed and delivered by such Azure Party, and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, each
Transaction Document to which such Azure Party is, or will be, a party
constitutes (or will constitute, when executed and delivered at the Closing)
the valid and binding agreement of such Azure Party, enforceable against such
Azure Party in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to legal
principles of general applicability governing the availability of equitable
remedies, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law) (collectively, "Creditors' Rights").

5.3 Non-Contravention. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3 of the Azure
Disclosure Schedules, the execution, delivery and performance of the
Transaction Documents to which each Azure Party is, or will be, a party by
such Azure Party and the consummation by each Azure Party of the transactions
contemplated thereby does not and will not: § conflict with any of, or require
the consent of any Person under, or result in any breach of, any provision of
the Organizational Documents of any Azure Party; § conflict with any of, or
require the consent of any Person under, or constitute a default (or an Event
that with the giving of notice or passage of time or both would give rise to a
default) or cause any obligation under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment, preferential purchase right or
acceleration (with or without the giving of notice, or the passage of time or
both) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to
which Azure or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any property or asset
of Azure or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected; § assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.4, conflict with or
violate any Law to which any Azure Party is subject or by which any property

of notice or the passage of time or both) an Event which would result in the
creation of, or afford any Person the right to obtain, any Lien (other than
Permitted Liens) on any asset of any Azure Party; or § result in the
revocation, cancellation, suspension, or material modification, individually
or in the aggregate, of any Governmental Approval that is necessary or
desirable for the ownership, lease or operation of the Legacy Assets or the
Legacy Business as now conducted, including any Governmental Approvals under
any applicable Environmental Law, except, in the cases of clauses (b), (c),
(d) and (e), for such defaults or rights of termination, cancellation,
amendment, acceleration, violations or Liens as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Legacy Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents to which each Azure Party is, or will be, a party or to materially
impair any Azure Party's ability to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which it is, or will be, a party. 



5.4 Governmental Approvals. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.4 of the Azure
Disclosure Schedules, no declaration, filing or registration with, or notice

Azure Party of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to

of its obligations under the Transaction Documents except in the cases of
clauses (i) and (ii), other than such declarations, filings, registrations,
notices, authorizations, consents or approvals that have been obtained or made
or that would in the ordinary course be made or obtained after the Closing, or
which, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents to which such Azure Party is, or will be, a party or to
materially impair such Azure Party's ability to perform its obligations under
the Transaction Documents to which it is, or will be, a party.

shall promptly notify the other Parties of (i) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any Event that would be likely to cause any condition to the
obligations of any Party to effect the Contribution, the Redemption or GP
Purchase, as applicable, and the other transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents not to be satisfied or (ii) the failure of any Party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of the other Party to
effect the Contribution, the Redemption or the GP Purchase, as applicable, and
the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents not to be
satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 8.4 shall not cure the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty,
the failure to comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party
receiving such notice; provided, further, that the failure to comply with this
Section 8.4 shall not result in the failure of any of the conditions to the
Closing in Article IX to be satisfied, or give rise to any right to terminate
this Agreement under Section 11.1, if the underlying Event would not in and of
itself give rise to such failure or right.

8.5 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(h) From the Execution Date until the Closing Date, each Marlin Party shall,
and shall cause each of the Marlin Entities to, (i) give Azure and its
Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, agents, employees,
counsel, advisors, consultants, auditors and other authorized representatives
(collectively, "Representatives") reasonable access to the offices,
properties, books and records of each Marlin Entity, in each case during
normal business hours and (ii) furnish to Azure and its Representatives such
financial and operating data and other information relating to each Marlin
Entity as such Persons may reasonably request, subject to Azure's and its
Representatives' compliance with applicable Law governing the use of such
information. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.5(a),
no Marlin Party shall be required to, or to cause any Marlin Entity to, grant
access or furnish information to Azure or any of its Representatives to the
extent that such information is subject to an attorney/client or attorney work
product privilege or that such access or the furnishing of such information is
prohibited by law or 



an existing contract or agreement. To the extent practicable, each Marlin
Party shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(i) From the Execution Date until the Closing Date, Azure shall (i) give
Marlin, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives reasonable access
to the offices, properties, books and records relating to the Legacy Assets
(including the Records), in each case during normal business hours and (ii)
furnish to Marlin, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives such
financial and operating data and other information relating to the Legacy
Assets as such Persons may reasonably request, subject to Marlin's, its
Affiliates' and their respective Representatives' compliance with applicable
Law governing the use of such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 8.5(b), Azure shall not be required to grant access
or furnish information to Marlin, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives to the extent that such information is subject to an
attorney/client or attorney work product privilege or that such access or the
furnishing of such information is prohibited by law or an existing contract or
agreement. To the extent practicable, Azure shall make reasonable and
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(j) With respect to any information disclosed pursuant to this Section 8.5,
each of the Marlin Parties, NMD and Azure shall comply with, and shall cause
each of its Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under that
certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 3, 2014, previously executed
by Azure, Marlin, Marlin GP and NMD (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). No
Party shall be required to provide access to or disclose any information where
such access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of
such Party or any Subsidiary of such Party or contravene any Contract or Law
(it being agreed that the Parties shall use their respective Reasonable Best
Efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not
result in such jeopardy or contravention)

8.6 Expenses.

(a) Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, (i) Azure shall pay
all costs and expenses incurred by the Azure Parties in connection with
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) Marlin
shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by any Marlin Party in connection
with Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby; and
(iii) the NMD Parties shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by the NMD
Parties in connection with Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby.

(b) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if any action at law or equity is
necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of the Transaction Documents, the
prevailing Party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
in addition to any other relief to which such Party may 



be entitled. In addition, any expenses incurred by Marlin pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter after the Execution Date and prior to the Closing shall be
shared evenly by Marlin and Azure and Azure shall reimburse Marlin for any
such expenses promptly following the delivery by Marlin of written evidence
describing such expenses.

8.7 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(f) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each Party shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to timely obtain all
authorizations, consents and approvals of all third parties necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents prior to the Closing. The Parties will coordinate and
cooperate with each other in exchanging such information and assistance as any
of the Parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.7 to the contrary, nothing in this
Section 8.7 shall be deemed to apply to the obligations of the Parties with
respect to obtaining the Marlin Debt Financing or the Azure Debt Consents,
which are more specifically addressed in Section 8.14.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Contract that would otherwise
be a Legacy Asset if an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent or
approval of another party thereto or any Governmental Authority, would
constitute a breach of any such Contract or in any way violate any applicable
Law, and such consent or approval is not obtained prior to the Closing.

(h) If, with respect to a Legacy Contract or a Right-of-Way, such consents or
approvals are not obtained, or if an attempted assignment would be
ineffective, the beneficial interest in and to such Legacy Contracts and
Right-of-Way shall in any event pass to Marlin at the Closing, and Azure shall
use Reasonable Best Efforts to provide to Marlin all of Azure's and its
Subsidiaries' interest in the benefits under any such Legacy Contract and
Rights-of-Way. Azure shall exercise or exploit its rights and options under
any such Legacy Contract (including the right to elect to terminate such
Legacy Contract in accordance with the terms thereof) and Right-of-Way, as
applicable, only as directed by Marlin. If Marlin receives an economic benefit
under any such Legacy Contract or Right-of-Way, Marlin shall accept the
burdens and perform the obligations under such Legacy Contract or Right-of-
Way, as applicable, as subcontractor of Azure to the extent of the benefit
received, and to the extent such burdens and obligations would have arisen on
or after the Closing Date. Furthermore, if the other parties to such a Legacy
Contract or Right-of-Way subsequently consent to the assignment of such
contract to Marlin, Marlin shall thereupon agree to assume and perform all
liabilities and the obligations arising thereunder after the date of such 



consent, at which time such Legacy Contract or Right-of-Way, as applicable,
shall be deemed a Legacy Asset, without the payment of further consideration,
and the obligations so assumed thereunder shall be deemed assumed by Marlin.

8.8 Public Statements. The Parties shall consult with each other prior to
issuing any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to
the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby and none of
the Azure Parties or the NMD Parties shall, and the Azure Parties and the NMD
Parties shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, issue any such public
announcement, statement or other disclosure without having first obtained
approval of the contents thereof by the non-issuing Parties; provided,
however, that any of the Azure Parties, the NMD Parties or their respective
Affiliates may make any public disclosure without first so consulting with or
notifying the other Party or Parties or obtaining consent to the contents
thereof if such disclosing Party reasonably believes that it is required by
Law or a national securities exchange to do so.

8.9 No Solicitation.

(a) Prior to the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement,
neither the Marlin Parties nor the NMD Parties shall, and neither the Marlin
Parties nor the NMD Parties shall permit its controlled Affiliates or (using
Reasonable Best Efforts) its or their respective Representatives to, directly
or indirectly, (a) discuss, encourage, negotiate, undertake, initiate,
authorize, recommend, propose or enter into, any transaction involving any
sale, lease, license, exchange, mortgage, transfer or other disposition, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, of all or a portion of
the IDRH Subject Interests or the Marlin GP Interests, whether by merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or sale of equity interests or
other securities, reorganization or recapitalization, loan, issuance of equity
interests or other securities or any other transaction, except for the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (a "Marlin Acquisition
Transaction"), (b) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of a Marlin
Acquisition Transaction, (c) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any Person,
any information concerning the IDRH Subject Interests or the Marlin GP
Interests in connection with a Marlin Acquisition Transaction or (d) otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or
encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the
foregoing. Upon the execution of this Agreement, each Marlin Party and each
NMD Party shall, and each Marlin Party and each NMD Party shall cause its
Affiliates and (using Reasonable Best Efforts) its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Azure) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Marlin Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Section 8.9(a) shall in no way prohibit the board of
directors or officers of Marlin GP (in its capacity as the general partner of
Marlin GP) 



from taking any action required by its duties to Marlin and its partners under
applicable Law or the Marlin Partnership Agreement.

(b) Prior to the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement,
Azure shall not, nor shall it permit its controlled Affiliates or (using
Reasonable Best Efforts) its or their respective Representatives to, directly
or indirectly, (a) discuss, encourage, negotiate, undertake, initiate,
authorize, recommend, propose or enter into, any transaction involving any
sale, lease, license, exchange, mortgage, transfer or other disposition, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, of all or a portion of
the Legacy Assets or the Legacy Business, whether by merger, consolidation,
business combination, purchase or sale of equity interests or other
securities, reorganization or recapitalization, loan, issuance of equity
interests or other securities or any other transaction, except for the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (an "Azure Acquisition
Transaction"), (b) facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an Azure
Acquisition Transaction, (c) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any Person,
any information concerning the Legacy Assets or the Legacy Business in
connection with an Azure Acquisition Transaction or (d) otherwise cooperate in
any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort
or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Upon the
execution of this Agreement, Azure shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
(using Reasonable Best Efforts) its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than the NMD Parties and the Marlin
Parties) conducted heretofore with respect to any Azure Acquisition
Transaction.

8.10 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.

(e) • NMD, in order to induce Marlin and Azure to enter into this Agreement
and in conjunction with its sale of goodwill herein, agrees to the provisions
of this Section 8.10(a) on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries. During the
Prohibited Period, NMD will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, carry on or engage in any Restricted Activity within
the Territory. "Prohibited Period" shall mean two years from and after the
Closing Date; provided, however, that the term "Prohibited Period" shall mean
five years from and after the Closing Date with respect to those covenants set
forth in the previous sentence that relate to that portion of the Restricted
Activity that involves the transloading of crude oil.

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, NMD or any of its Subsidiaries may own an
aggregate of less than 5% of the outstanding Interests of an entity engaged in
a Restricted Activity, so long as such Interests are listed on a national
securities exchange or regularly traded in the over the counter market by a
member of a national securities exchange), provided that neither NMD nor any
of its Subsidiaries has the power, directly or indirectly, to control or
direct the management or affairs of any such entity. Further, notwithstanding 



the foregoing, nothing herein will prevent NMD or any of its Subsidiaries from
having an ownership interest in, or otherwise being affiliated with, Marlin as
contemplated herein.

(ii) NMD further expressly covenants and agrees that during the Prohibited
Period it will not (and it will cause its Subsidiaries not to) directly or
indirectly engage or employ, or solicit or contact with a view to the
engagement or employment of any Person who is an employee of Azure, Marlin or
their respective Affiliates; provided, however, NMD or its Affiliates may
employ any individual who responds to a general solicitation not specifically
directed to such individual or who contacts NMD or its Affiliate for a
position with NMD without any direct solicitation by NMD or its Affiliates.

(f) NMD agrees and acknowledges that the limitations as to time, geographical
area and scope of activity to be restrained as set forth in this Section 8.10
are reasonable in all respects, are part of the consideration agreed to in
this Agreement for the Marlin GP Purchase Price and Redemption Purchase Price,
and do not impose any greater restraint than is necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of Marlin. NMD further agrees and acknowledges
that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions
of this Section 8.10, Marlin and Azure, as applicable, may be entitled to seek
injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause Marlin and Azure, as
applicable, irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at
law. Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prohibit Marlin or Azure from
pursuing or obtaining any other remedies available to them, whether at law or
in equity or otherwise, for any such breach or threatened breach.

(g) The Parties hereby represent that they have read and understand, and agree
to be bound by, the terms of this Section 8.10. NMD acknowledges that the
geographic scope and duration of the covenants made by NMD contained in this
Section 8.10 are the result of arm's length bargaining and are fair and
reasonable in light of § the nature and geographic scope of the business of
the Marlin Entities, which conduct the Restricted Activity throughout the
Territory, § NMD's level of control over and contact with the business of the
Marlin Entities and its customers in all jurisdictions in which it is
conducted and § the amount of consideration that NMD is receiving, and the
goodwill that it is selling, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the
provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Laws, whether now or hereafter in effect and therefore, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, the Parties waive any provision of
applicable Laws that would render any provision of this Section 8.10 invalid
or unenforceable.

(h) To the extent that any part of this Section 8.10 may be overbroad,
invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such
part shall be enforceable to the fullest extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would 



have been enforceable, and such part shall be deemed to have been so written
and the remaining parts shall as written be effective and enforceable in all
events.

8.11 [Reserved]

8.12 Tax Matters.

(j) Transfer Taxes. Fifty percent (50%) of all transfer, stamp, documentary,
sales, use, registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all
applicable real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with the
contribution, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Legacy Assets (the
"Transfer Taxes") shall be borne by Marlin, and the remainder of such Transfer
Taxes shall be borne by Azure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 8.12, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with
Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by the Party primarily or
customarily responsible under the applicable local law for filing such Tax
Returns, and such Party will use Reasonable Best Efforts to provide such Tax
Returns to the other Party at least ten days prior to the due date for such
Tax Returns. Upon the filing of Tax Returns in connection with Transfer Taxes,
the filing Party shall provide the other Party with evidence satisfactory to
the other Party that such Transfer Taxes have been filed and paid.

(k) Cooperation. Each of the Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Party's request) the provision of records and information relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder.

(l) Tax Treatment. The Parties intend that (i) the Contribution shall be
treated as a contribution by Azure to Marlin of the Legacy Assets in exchange
for the Contribution Interests in a transaction subject to the requirements of
Section 721(a) of the Code; and (ii) the distribution of the Contribution Cash
Consideration shall be treated as a distribution to Azure by Marlin under
Section 731 of the Code that qualifies as a reimbursement of pre-formation
capital expenditures to the maximum extent permissible under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.707-4(d). Unless otherwise required by a change in
applicable Law, the Parties agree to file all Tax Returns and otherwise act at
all times in a manner consistent with this intended treatment set forth in
this Section 8.12, including disclosing the distribution of the Contribution
Closing Price in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.707-3(c)(2) of
the Treasury Regulations.

8.13 Financial Statements. The Parties shall, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to, use their Reasonable Best Efforts to cooperate in the
preparation as soon as practicable of any financial statements that may be
required to be filed with the SEC by any Party hereto or any of their
respective Affiliates as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, as
necessary to satisfy any rule or 



regulation of the SEC, to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations of any Party
or any of its Affiliates under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or as
may otherwise be required by applicable Law or by any securities exchange.
Azure agrees to bear all costs and expenses associated with the preparation of
the audited balance sheets of the Legacy Business as of December 31, 2014,
2013 and 2012, and the related audited income statements and statements of
cash flows, for the respective twelve-month periods of operations of the
Legacy Business, then ended, together with the footnotes thereto, if any, to
the extent required to be filed with the SEC by any Party or any of their
respective Affiliates.

8.14 Financings.

(a) Each Marlin Party shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all reasonable actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Marlin
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter, including using its Reasonable Best Efforts to satisfy
or execute on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions and
covenants applicable to Marlin in the Debt Commitment Letter and such
definitive agreements to be entered into pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letter. Subject to the last sentence of Section 8.14(e), Azure shall use its
Reasonable Best Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Azure Debt Consents.

(b) Azure shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all reasonable actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to assist Marlin in arranging and obtaining the
Marlin Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) The Marlin Parties shall not agree to any adverse amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy available
to Marlin under, the Debt Commitment Letter without the prior written consent
of Azure.

(d) From the Execution Date until the Closing Date, each of the Marlin Parties
and Azure shall promptly notify the other Parties in writing of any fact,
change, condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event
that would result or reasonably be likely to result in all or a portion of the
Marlin Debt Financing or the Azure Debt Consents not being available at
Closing. In the event that all or a portion of the Marlin Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Marlin
Debt Financing or from sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter,
each of the Marlin Parties and Azure shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to
obtain the funds necessary for Marlin to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this 



Agreement to the extent available on substantially similar terms and
conditions as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

(e) In furtherance of obtaining both the Marlin Debt Financing and the Azure
Debt Consents, each Marlin Party and Azure shall, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries, and (using Reasonable Best Efforts) its and such
Subsidiaries' respective officers, employees and advisors (including legal,
tax, regulatory and accounting advisors) to cooperate as necessary or as
reasonably requested by Azure or Marlin, as applicable, in connection with
each of the Marlin Debt Financing and the Azure Debt Consents, including the
following: (i) providing, as promptly as reasonably practicable, information
(financial or otherwise) relating to each of them, respectively, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the Financing Sources to the
extent reasonably requested by any such Financing Sources; (ii) causing the
senior officers and other representatives of the Marlin Entities to
participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions), drafting sessions, sessions
with rating agencies and other marketing efforts with respect to the Marlin
Debt Financing and the Azure Debt Consents, on reasonable advance notice;
(iii) assisting with the preparation of appropriate and customary materials
for rating agency presentations, customary debt offering documents and
customary information memoranda and similar documents in connection with the
Marlin Debt Financing and the Azure Debt Consents; (iv) providing
authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of
information to prospective lenders and containing a representation to the
Financing Sources that the public side versions of such documents, if any, do
not include material non-public information about the Marlin Entities or their
respective Affiliates or securities; (v) otherwise cooperating with the
Financing Sources' due diligence; (vi) assisting with the preparation of, and
executing and delivering, applicable pledge and security documents, loan
agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements, other definitive
financing documents and amendments to the foregoing, containing terms and
conditions which, individually and taken as a whole, are no less favorable to

12.4 Limitations and Other Indemnity Claim Matters. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Article XII or elsewhere in this Agreement (subject to
Section 12.4(g)), the following terms shall apply to any claim for monetary
damages arising out of this Agreement or related to the transactions
contemplated hereby:

(f) De Minimis. No indemnifying party (an "Indemnifying Party") will have any
liability under this Article XII in respect of any individual claim involving
Losses arising under Section 12.1(b) or Section 12.3(b) to any Indemnitee of
less than $50,000 (each, a "De Minimis Claim").

(g) Deductible.

(vi) Azure will not have any liability under Section 12.1(b) unless and until
the Marlin Indemnitees have suffered Losses in excess of $1,625,000 in the
aggregate (the "Azure Deductible") arising from Claims under Section 12.1(b)
that are not De Minimis Claims and then recoverable Losses claimed under
Section 12.1(b) shall be limited to those that exceed the Azure Deductible.

(vii) The NMD Parties will not have any liability under Section 12.3(b) unless
and until the Azure Indemnitees have suffered Losses in excess of $700,000 in

(h) Cap.

(viii) Azure's aggregate liability under Section 12.1(b) shall not exceed
$16,250,000.

(ix) The NMD Parties' aggregate liability under Section 12.3(b) shall not
exceed $7,000,000.

(i) Survival; Claims Period.

(xvi) The representations and warranties of the Parties under this Agreement
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect until the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date
(the "Expiration Date"); provided that the Azure Fundamental Representations
and the NMD Fundamental Representations shall survive for a period equal to
the applicable statute of limitations for each such representation (the
"Fundamental Expiration Date"). 



(xvii) No action for a breach of any representation or warranty contained
herein shall be brought after the Expiration Date or the Fundamental
Expiration Date, as applicable, except for claims of which a Party has
received a Claim Notice setting forth in reasonable detail the claimed
misrepresentation or breach of warranty with reasonable detail, prior to the
Expiration Date.

(j) Calculation of Losses. In calculating amounts payable to any Indemnitee
(each such person, an "Indemnified Party") for a claim for indemnification
hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Losses shall be determined without
duplication of any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made
or could be made under any other representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement and shall be computed net of (i) payments actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect to such Losses and
(ii) any prior or subsequent actual recovery by the Indemnified Party from any
Person other than the applicable indemnifying party (an "Indemnifying Party")
with respect to such Losses. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the recovery of an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 12.3(b) shall be
limited to the actual Losses incurred by such Indemnified Party based on the
economic ownership of such Indemnified Party in Marlin as of the Closing
together with any ownership interest in Marlin owned by such Indemnified Party
acquired pursuant to the Option as of the date a claim for indemnity is made
by such Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 12.3(b), as applicable.

(k) Waiver of Certain Damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in no event shall any Party be liable for punitive, special,
indirect, consequential, remote, speculative or lost profits damages of any
kind or nature, regardless of the form of action through which such damages
are sought, except (i) for any such damages recovered by any third party
against an Indemnified Party in respect of which such Indemnified Party would
otherwise be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the terms hereof and (ii)
in the case of consequential damages, (A) to the extent an Indemnified Party
is required to pay consequential damages to an unrelated third party and (B)
to the extent of consequential damages to an Indemnified Party arising from
fraud or willful misconduct.

(l) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Except for the assertion of any claim based on
fraud or willful misconduct, the remedies provided in this Article XII shall
be the sole and exclusive legal remedies of the Parties, from and after the
Closing, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

12.5 Indemnification Procedures.

(c) Each Indemnitee agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of facts
giving rise to a claim by it for indemnification pursuant to this Article XII,
including receipt by it of notice of any Proceeding, by any third party with
respect to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to 



indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, such Indemnitee must assert
its claim for indemnification under this Article XII (each, a "Claim") by
providing a written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party
allegedly required to provide indemnification protection under this Article
XII specifying, in reasonable detail, the nature and basis for such Claim
(e.g., the underlying representation, warranty, covenant or agreement alleged
to have been breached). Such notice shall include a formal demand for
indemnification under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
Indemnitee's failure to send or delay in sending a third party Claim Notice
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability hereunder with respect
to such Claim except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure or delay and except as is otherwise provided
herein. If the indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the Indemnifying
Party thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in
sufficient time to permit the indemnifying party or its counsel to defend
against such matter and to make a timely response thereto including any
responsive motion or answer to a complaint, petition, notice or other legal,
equitable or administrative process relating to the Claim, the Indemnifying
Party's indemnity obligation relating to such Claim shall be limited to the
extent that such knowing failure to notify the Indemnifying Party has actually
resulted in material prejudice or damage to the Indemnifying Party. Except as
specifically provided herein, each Indemnitee's rights and remedies set forth
in this Agreement will survive the Closing and will not be deemed waived by
such Indemnitee's consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
will be effective regardless of any inspection or investigation conducted, or
the awareness of any matters acquired (or capable or reasonably capable of
being acquired), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee or by its directors,
officers, employees, or representatives or at any time (regardless of whether
notice of such knowledge has been given to the Indemnifying Party), whether
before or after the Execution Date or the Closing Date with respect to any
circumstances constituting a condition under this Agreement.

(d) In the event of the assertion of any third party Claim for which, by the
terms hereof, an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee,
the Indemnifying Party will have the right, at such Indemnifying Party's
expense, to assume the defense of same including the appointment and selection
of counsel on behalf of the Indemnitee so long as such counsel is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the
defense of any such third party Claim, it shall within 30 days of its receipt
of the Claim Notice notify the Indemnitee in writing of its intent to do so.
Any such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnitee as may be appropriate. The Indemnifying
Party will have the right to settle or compromise or take any corrective or
remediation action with respect to any such Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be diligently prosecuted by the
Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnitee will be entitled, at its own cost, to
participate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such third-party Claim but
fails to diligently prosecute such Claim, or if the Indemnifying 



Party does not assume the defense of any such Claim, the Indemnitee may assume
control of such defense and in the event it is determined pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this Article XII that the Claim was a matter for which
the Indemnifying Party is required to provide indemnification under the terms
of this Article XII, the Indemnifying Party will bear the reasonable costs and
expenses of such defense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses).

(e) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnitee agrees to
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting
any Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest or, if appropriate, in
making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Claim, or any cross-
complaint against any Person, and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the
Indemnitee for any reasonable expenses incurred by it in so cooperating. At no
cost or expense to the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnitee and its counsel in contesting any Claim.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree, in each case, that subjects the Indemnitee to any criminal liability,
requires an admission of guilt, wrongdoing or fault on the part of the
Indemnitee or imposes any continuing obligation on or requires any payment
from the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee's prior written consent.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Article XII to the contrary, any
indemnification payment to be made to an Indemnittee pursuant to this Article
XII shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the
Indemnifying Party to an account designated by the Indemnitee within ten (10)
days after the final determination thereof.

12.6 Express Negligence. THE PARTIES INTEND THAT THE INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN
THIS ARTICLE XII BE CONSTRUED AND APPLIED AS WRITTEN ABOVE, NOTWITHSTANDING
ANY RULE OF CONSTRUCTION TO THE CONTRARY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SUCH
INDEMNITIES SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY STATE'S "EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE" OR
SIMILAR RULE THAT WOULD DENY COVERAGE BASED ON AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY'S SOLE OR
CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. IT IS THE INTENT
OF THE PARTIES THAT, TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED ABOVE, THE INDEMNITIES SET FORTH
IN THIS ARTICLE XII SHALL APPLY TO AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY'S SOLE OR CONCURRENT,
ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS
PROVISION IS "CONSPICUOUS" FOR PURPOSES OF ALL STATE LAWS. 



12.7 No Reliance.

(i) THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF AZURE CONTAINED IN ARTICLE V
CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF AZURE TO
THE MARLIN PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE NMD PARTIES CONTAINED IN
ARTICLE VI AND ARTICLE VII CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS

CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER MADE BY SUCH PARTY OR ANY OF ITS
AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES
(INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF, OR ANY PERSON'S RELIANCE ON,
ANY INFORMATION, DISCLOSURE OR OTHER DOCUMENT OR OTHER MATERIAL MADE AVAILABLE
TO ANY PARTY IN ANY DATA ROOM, ELECTRONIC DATA ROOM, MANAGEMENT PRESENTATION

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT). EXCEPT FOR SUCH REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES, EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, PROJECTION, FORECAST, STATEMENT, OR INFORMATION
MADE, COMMUNICATED OR FURNISHED (ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR
ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES
(INCLUDING OPINION, INFORMATION, PROJECTION, OR ADVICE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OR
MAY BE PROVIDED TO ANY PARTY OR ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE, AGENT OR
REPRESENTATIVE OF SUCH PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES).

12.8 Tax Treatment. Any payments made to any Party pursuant to Article XII
shall constitute an adjustment of the Marlin Contribution Consideration, the
Redemption Purchase Price or the Marlin GP Purchase Price, as applicable, for
Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by the Parties on their Tax Returns
to the extent permitted by Law.

12.9 Release. For and in consideration of the Marlin GP Purchase Price and the
Redemption Purchase Price, effective as of the Closing, NMD shall, and shall

obligations, liabilities and claims whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both
in law and in equity, in each case to the extent arising out of or resulting
from the ownership and/or operation of the Marlin Entities, or the assets,
business, operations, conduct, services, products and/or employees (including
former employees) of the Marlin Entities (and any predecessors), related to
any period of time before the Closing Date.

ARTICLE XIII 
GOVERNING LAW AND CONSENT TO JURISDICTION

13.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
