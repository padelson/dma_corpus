Dissenters Shares and shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_)
shall be converted into and become the right to receive, without interest,
the Per Series B Payment. All such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired.



 

3 (h) _Adjustment in Certain Circumstances_. In calculating the consideration
payable under this  _Section 2.1_, Parent shall be entitled to rely on the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 5.2_. If such
representations and warranties are not correct, Parent shall have the right to
adjust the Merger Consideration accordingly but without reducing the Purchase
Price and, notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate merger consideration payable by
Parent, Sub or the Surviving Corporation to the holders of equity interests
in the Company (including any holder of any Company Stock Option or Company
Warrant) in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby exceed the Purchase Price.



In addition, the conversion terms set forth in this _Section 2.1_ (including
the determination of the Per Common Payment, the Per Series A Payment, the Per
Series A-2 Payment, the Per Series A-3 Payment and the Per Series B Payment)
are dependent upon the Purchase Price, determined as of the Closing Date,
as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.2_, being equal to or greater than
$218,500,000. If the Purchase Price, determined as of the Closing Date, as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.2_, is less than $218,500,000, then the
conversion terms set forth in this _Section 2.1_ (including the
determination of the Per Common Payment, the Per Series A Payment, the Per
Series A-2 Payment, the Per Series A-3 Payment and the Per Series B Payment)
shall be modified so as to comply with the provisions of Article IV(C)(2) of
the Company Charter.



Section 2.2 _Determination of Estimated Working Capital_. (a) At least three
business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate executed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated the date of its
delivery, stating that there has been conducted under the supervision of each
such officer a review of all relevant information and data then available
and setting forth the Companys reasonable best estimate of the Estimated
Working Capital, including an estimate of the various accounts which such
officers anticipate based on the most recent available financial statements
and information will be reflected on the Valuation Date Balance Sheet
prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles.



(b) If the Base Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital, the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of such excess. If the
Base Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital, the Purchase
Price shall be increased by the amount of such deficiency.



Section 2.3 _Determination of Valuation Date Working Capital_. (a) As promptly
as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Effective Date, Parent
shall cause the Company to:



(i) prepare, in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles, a balance
sheet with respect to the Company as of the Valuation Date (the " _Preliminary
Valuation Date Balance Sheet_ ");



 

4 (ii) determine the Valuation Date Working Capital in accordance with the
Agreed Accounting Principles and the provisions of this Agreement (such
Valuation Date Working Capital as determined by the Company being referred to
as the " _Preliminary Valuation Date Working Capital_ "); and



(iii) deliver to the Shareholder Representative the Preliminary Valuation
Date Balance Sheet and a calculation of the Preliminary Valuation Date Working
Capital (the " _Preliminary Accounting Report_ ").



(b) Following receipt of the Preliminary Accounting Report, the Shareholder
Representative may review the same and, within 30 days after the date of such
receipt (the " _Notice Period_ "), may deliver to Parent a certificate signed
by it setting forth its objections to the Preliminary Valuation Date Balance
Sheet and the Preliminary Valuation Date Working Capital as set forth in the
Preliminary Accounting Report, specifying in reasonable detail the nature and
extent of its objections. In the event the Shareholder Representative does not
so object within the Notice Period, the Preliminary Valuation Date Balance
Sheet and the Preliminary Valuation Date Working Capital set forth in the
Preliminary Accounting Report shall be final and binding as the " _Valuation
Date Balance Sheet_ " and the Valuation Date Working Capital, respectively,
for purposes of this Agreement but shall not limit the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement.



(c) In the event the Shareholder Representative so objects within the Notice
Period, Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall use reasonable
efforts to resolve by written agreement (the " _Agreed Adjustments_ ") any
differences as to the Preliminary Valuation Date Balance Sheet and the
Preliminary Valuation Date Working Capital and, in the event Parent and the
Shareholder Representative so resolve any such differences, the Preliminary
Valuation Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Valuation Date Working
Capital set forth in the Preliminary Accounting Report as adjusted by the
Agreed Adjustments shall be final and binding as the " _Valuation Date
Balance Sheet_ " and the Valuation Date Working Capital, respectively, for
purposes of this Agreement but shall not limit the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement.



(d) In the event any objections raised by the Shareholder Representative are
not resolved by Agreed Adjustments within the 30 day period next following the
Notice Period, then Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall submit
the objections that are then unresolved to Ernst and Young LLP and such firm
(the " _Accounting Firm_ ") shall be directed by Parent and the Shareholder
Representative to resolve the unresolved objections (based solely on
the presentations by Parent and by the Shareholder Representative as to
whether any disputed matter had been determined in a manner consistent with
the Agreed Accounting Principles and this Agreement) as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to deliver written notice to each of Parent and the
Shareholder Representative setting forth its resolution of the disputed
matters. The Preliminary Valuation Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary
Valuation Date Working Capital, after giving effect to any Agreed Adjustments
and to the resolution of disputed matters by the Accounting Firm, shall be
final and binding as the " _Valuation Date Balance Sheet_ " and the Valuation
Date Working Capital, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement but shall
not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.



 

5 (e) The parties hereto shall make available to Parent, Parents accountants,
the Shareholder Representative, the Shareholder Representatives accountants
and, if applicable, the Accounting Firm such books, records and other
information (including work papers) as any of the foregoing may reasonably
request to prepare or review the Preliminary Accounting Report or any matters
submitted to the Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of Parents
accountants shall be paid by Parent. The fees and expenses of the Shareholder
Representatives accountants shall be paid by the Shareholder Representative;
_provided_ , _however_ , that up to $50,000 of such fees and expenses shall be
reimbursed by the Surviving Corporation. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm hereunder shall be paid by the non-prevailing party. A party
is the "non-prevailing party" if the Accounting Firms determination of
Valuation Date Working Capital is closer to the other partys determination of
Valuation Date Working Capital, as submitted to the Accounting Firm, than it
is to that partys determination of Valuation Date Working Capital, as
submitted to the Accounting Firm.



Section 2.4 _Payment of the Purchase Price Adjustment_. Promptly following the
final determination of the Valuation Date Balance Sheet pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)_, _2.3(c)_ or _2.3(d)_ , the following shall occur:



(a) If the Valuation Date Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working
Capital, the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be used to pay the amount
of such difference to Parent pursuant to _Section 2.5_.



(b) If the Valuation Date Working Capital is equal to or greater than the
Estimated Working Capital, the amount of such excess shall be distributed by
Parent in cash in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_.



Section 2.5 _Indemnification Escrow Amount_. At the Effective Time, Parent
will deposit the Indemnification Escrow Amount with LaSalle Bank N.A. or such
other escrow agent as shall be mutually agreed to by the parties and named in
the Escrow Agreement (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), and the Indemnification Escrow
Amount shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. Each Shareholder will be deemed, without any act of such
Shareholder, to have received and deposited with the Escrow Agent that number
of shares of Parent Common Stock representing such Shareholders percentage
ownership interest in the Companys outstanding capital stock, calculated on
an as-converted basis immediately prior to the Effective Time, indicated in 
_Schedule 2.5_ (the " _Escrow Percentage_ "), which Schedule shall be
delivered by the Company to Parent and the Escrow Agent at the Closing and
shall contain a calculation of the Escrow Percentage with respect to each
Shareholder. The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be used to (a) make any
payments that are required to be made under _Section 2.4(a)_ and (b) to pay
the indemnification obligations under _Article XI_ and, if not so used, shall
be paid in accordance with _Sections 3.1(d)_ and _3.1(e)_.



Section 2.6 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no Dissenters Shares shall be converted into or
represent any right to receive any Merger Consideration, and the holder of
such Dissenters Shares shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted
by the NCBCA. If a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock who dissents under the NCBCA shall effectively withdraw or
otherwise lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to
dissent, then, as of the



 

6 Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, (a)
each such share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the Per Common Payment, without interest, upon the
surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock,
(b) each such share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Per Series A Payment, without
interest, upon the surrender of the certificate representing such share of
Series A Preferred Stock, (c) each such share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock
shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Per Series
A-2 Payment, without interest, upon the surrender of the certificate
representing such share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, (d) each such share of
Series A-3 Preferred Stock shall be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the Per Series A-3 Payment, without interest, upon the
surrender of the certificate representing such share of Series A-3 Preferred
Stock, and (e) each such share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be converted
into and represent only the right to receive the Per Series B Payment, without
interest, upon the surrender of the certificate representing such share of
Series B Preferred Stock. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
notice of intent to demand payment, any attempted withdrawal of any such
notice and any other instrument served pursuant to the NCBCA received by the
Company relating to shareholders rights of dissent. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any dissenters demands, offer to settle any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands.



ARTICLE III

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES



Section 3.1 _Exchange Procedures_. (a) On or prior to the Effective Date,
Parent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
(each, a " _Certificate_ " and, collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock a letter of transmittal
substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_  (the " _Transmittal Letter_ "). The
Transmittal Letter shall contain customary representations and warranties by
the Person surrendering any Certificate; shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to Parent; and shall contain instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (i) any
applicable Per Common Payment, Per Series A Payment, Per Series A-2 Payment,
Per Series A-3 Payment or Per Series B Payment payable pursuant to _Section
2.1_, (ii) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_, (iii) cash as required to make payments
in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.2_ and (iv) dividends
or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to
_Section 3.8_ (such cash, shares of Parent Common Stock, dividends and

reasonable efforts to cause Transmittal Letters and associated Certificates
representing at least 90% of the Shares to be delivered to Parent prior to
the Closing Date.



(b) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver by check or wire transfer, or in the
case of Parent Common Stock cause Parents transfer agent to issue, to the
holder of a Certificate who has, at least five business days prior to the
Closing Date, surrendered such holders Certificate to Parent for
cancellation, together with the Transmittal Letter, duly executed, and



 

7 such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent and are customary
for similar transactions, subject to  _Sections 3.2_ and _3.7_ ,



(i) in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock represented thereby,

thereby, the Per Series A-3 Closing Payment and



(v) in exchange for each share of Series B Preferred Stock represented
thereby, the Per Series B Closing Payment,



and such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. After the
Closing Date, upon surrender of a Certificate to Parent for cancellation,
together with the Transmittal Letter, duly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by Parent and are customary for similar
transactions, Parent shall, within five business days after Parent receives
such Certificate, Transmittal Letter and other documents, deliver by check or
wire transfer, or in the case of Parent Common Stock cause Parents transfer
agent to issue, to the holder of such Certificate, subject to _Sections 3.2_
and _3.7_ , the payments to which such holder is entitled pursuant to clauses
(i)-(v) above.



(c) In the event that any distribution by Parent is required to be made
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ (any such amount to be distributed, the "
_Working Capital Distribution Amount_ "), within five business days after the
final determination of the Valuation Date Working Capital pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)_, _2.3(c)_ or _2.3(d)_ , Parent shall distribute to each Person that
has surrendered a Certificate to Parent for cancellation, together with the
Transmittal Letter, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
have been required by Parent and are customary for similar
transactions, subject to _Section 3.7_, with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, a cash payment in the
amount equal to the Per Share Working Capital Payment.



(d) Within five business days after the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall determine the amount (the " _Initial Escrow
Amount_ ") equal to the Indemnification Escrow Amount _minus_ (x) all amounts
paid out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement and (y) the aggregate amount of claims set forth in one or
more Claim Notices that have not been resolved by Parent and the Shareholder
Representative as of such date, and promptly following such determination,
Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent to distribute to each Person that has
surrendered a Certificate to Parent for cancellation, together with the
Transmittal Letter, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
have been required by Parent and have been customary for similar
transactions, subject to _Section 3.7_, an amount equal to the product of the
Initial Escrow Amount and such Persons applicable Escrow Percentage.



 

8 (e) Within five business days after the resolution of any unresolved Claim
Notice after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall
determine the amount (the " _Subsequent Escrow Amount_ ") equal to any balance
of the Indemnification Escrow Amount not distributed pursuant to _Section
3.1(d)_ _minus_  (i) all amounts which Parent Group Members are entitled to
receive pursuant to such resolved Claim Notice _and (ii) _the aggregate
amount of claims set forth in any remaining unresolved Claim Notices, and
promptly following such determination, Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent
to distribute to each Person that has surrendered a Certificate to Parent for
cancellation, together with the Transmittal Letter, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably have been required by Parent and have been
customary for similar transactions, subject to _Section 3.7_, equal to the
product of the Subsequent Escrow Amount and such Persons applicable Escrow
Percentage.



Section 3.2 _No Fractional Securities_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of
a Certificate for exchange pursuant to _Section 3.1_; no Parent dividend or
other distribution or stock split shall relate to any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock; and no fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a securityholder
of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional share, each holder of Company
Preferred Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ will be paid an amount in cash (without interest),
rounded down to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying (a) the
Average Parent Share Price by (b) the fractional interest to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled.



Section 3.3 _Payments to Persons Not Named in Certificates_. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Subject to the applicable provisions of the NCBCA, until
surrendered as contemplated by _Section 3.1_, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Per Common Payment for each share of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate, the Per Series A Payment for
each share of Series A Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate, the
Per Series A-2 Payment for each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock
represented by each such Certificate, the Per Series A-3 Payment for each
share of Series A-3 Preferred Stock represented by each such Certificate and
the Per Series B Payment for each share of Series B Preferred Stock
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by _Sections 2.1_ and _3.1_.
No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable, whether in respect of
the Per Common Closing Payment, Per Series A Closing Payment, Per Series A-2
Closing Payment, Per Series A-3 Closing Payment, Series B Closing Payment,
dividends or otherwise, upon surrender of any Certificate.



Section 3.4 _Company Transfer Books; Lost Certificates_. (a) At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer
of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock shall thereafter
be made on the records of the Company.



 

9 (b) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the
delivery of an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent pursuant to which such Person agrees to indemnify Parent and the
Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, Parent will direct Parents transfer
agent to issue the shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and Parent will issue the cash to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.1_, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2_ and any dividends or other distributions
to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.8_, all
subject to and in accordance with _Section 3.1_.



Section 3.5 _No Further Ownership Rights_. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ upon conversion of any shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, subject, however, to
the Surviving Corporations obligations to pay or provide for the rights of
dissenters. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificate shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.



Section 3.6 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parents transfer agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash
or Parent Common Stock from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Per Common
Payment, Per Series A Payment, Per Series A-2 Payment, Per Series A-3 Payment
or Per Series B Payment payable in respect of any share represented by such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Body, any cash, Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or
distribution in respect of any share represented by such Certificate shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.



Section 3.7 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. The Surviving Corporation will pay such withheld
amounts to the appropriate taxing authority.



Section 3.8 _Dividends and Distributions_. Subject to the effect of applicable
law, there shall be paid to each record holder of a new certificate
representing Parent Common Stock: (a) at the time of the surrender of the
Certificate in exchange for which such record



 

10 holder received such Parent Common Stock or as promptly as practicable
thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions theretofore
paid with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such new
certificate and having a record date on or after the Effective Time and a
payment date prior to such surrender and (b) at the appropriate payment date
or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by such new certificate and having a record date on or after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date on or
subsequent to such surrender.

ARTICLE VII

ACTION PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME



The respective parties hereto covenant and agree to take the following
actions between the date hereof and the Effective Time:

(a) The Company will, as soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, duly submit this Agreement to the Shareholders for the purpose of
considering the approval of this Agreement and the Merger, all in accordance
with the NCBCA, the Company Charter and the Companys Bylaws. The Company has,
through its Board of Directors, recommended to the Shareholders the approval
of this Agreement as required by the NCBCA, and, so long as this Agreement has
not been terminated in accordance with _Article XII_ , the Companys Board of
Directors shall not withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify,
such recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts (including, at the request of Parent, in the event
that (i) the North Carolina Approval Order is not issued within five business
days after the Fairness Hearing is held or (ii) a Fairness Hearing is not held
within 15 business days after the date of the filing of the application for
the Fairness Hearing, direction from the Companys Board of Directors
that the Shareholders take such action by written consent in accordance with

38 (b) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare any Disclosure
Materials required by applicable Requirements of Law as promptly as possible
after the date hereof and shall use reasonable best efforts to submit the
proposed Disclosure Materials to Parent and its counsel not less than two
business days prior to submitting the Disclosure Materials to the
Shareholders. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to furnish the Company
with such information concerning Parent as shall be required to be included in
the Disclosure Materials. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
(i) mail the Disclosure Materials to Shareholders on or before January 27,
2006 and (ii) convene the meeting for the Shareholder Approval on the business
day immediately following the Fairness Hearing. If prior to the Effective
Time either (A) the Company determines that the Disclosure Materials need to
be amended or supplemented in order for the representation and warranty of the
Company in _Section 5.28_ to be correct or (B) Parent determines that the
Disclosure Materials need to be amended or supplemented in order for the
representation and warranty of Parent in _Section 6.4_ to be correct, the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall notify the other of
such determination and shall deliver to the other such amendment or
supplement as such party believes is necessary to make such representation and
warranty correct. The Company shall consider all such amendments proposed by
Parent and shall cause all such amendments or supplements that the parties
reasonably believe are necessary to be mailed to the Shareholders as soon as
practicable after such delivery.



(c) In the event that the Shareholder Approval is obtained at a meeting of
Shareholders, as promptly as practicable after obtaining such
Shareholder Approval, but in no event later than ten days after obtaining
such Shareholder Approval, the Company shall mail each Shareholder who has
satisfied the requirements of Section 55-13-21 of the NCBCA a written
dissenters notice. Such notice shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent and shall be in compliance with Section 55-13-22 of the NCBCA.



(d) In the event that the Shareholder Approval is obtained by written consent,
as promptly as practicable after obtaining such Shareholder Approval, but in
no event later than ten days after obtaining such Shareholder Approval, the
Company shall notify each Shareholder who is entitled to dissenters rights
with respect to the approval of the Merger that dissenters rights are
available, pursuant to Section 55-13-02 of the NCBCA. Such notice shall be in
a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall be in compliance with Section
55-13-20 of the NCBCA.



(e) The Company shall advise Parent as promptly as practicable of any
purported payment demand received from any Shareholder pursuant to Section
55-13-23 of the NCBCA.



(f) The Company (through its Board of Directors) shall not require a greater
or different vote of the Shareholders to approve the Merger or this Agreement
than that described in the first sentence of _Section 5.30_.



Section 7.2 _Action by Parent_. Parent, as the sole shareholder of Sub, shall
take such actions as may be necessary to approve the Merger and this Agreement
as required by the NCBCA.



 

39 Section 7.3 _Access to Information_. The Company shall afford to the officers,
employees and authorized representatives of Parent (including independent
public accountants, financial advisors, lenders and other financing sources,
environmental consultants and attorneys) complete access during normal
business hours to the offices, properties, employees and business and
financial records (including computer files, retrieval programs and similar
documentation and such access and information that may be necessary in
connection with an environmental audit) of the Company to the extent Parent
shall reasonably deem necessary or desirable and shall furnish to Parent or
its authorized representatives such additional information concerning the
Company as shall be reasonably requested, including all such information as
shall be necessary to enable Parent or its representatives to verify the
accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, to
verify that the covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement have been
complied with and to determine whether the conditions set forth in _Article
IX_ have been satisfied. Parent agrees that such investigation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operations of the Company. No investigation made by Parent or its
representatives hereunder shall affect the representations and warranties of
the Company hereunder.



Section 7.4 _Notification of Certain Events_. Each party shall promptly notify
the other parties of any action, suit or proceeding that shall be instituted
or threatened against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge
the legality of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent of (a) any lawsuit, claim, proceeding
or investigation that may be threatened, brought, asserted or commenced
against the Company that would have been listed on _Schedule 5.13_ of the
Disclosure Schedule if such lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation had
arisen prior to the date hereof and (b) any other event or matter that
becomes known to the Company and would cause any other representation or
warranty contained in _Article V_ to be untrue in any material respect. Should
any New Matter require any change in the Disclosure Schedule, the Company
will promptly deliver to Parent a supplement to the applicable schedule of the
Disclosure Schedule specifying such change and the Companys good faith
estimate of any Losses and Expenses associated with such change.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall such supplemental disclosure
constitute an admission of liability with respect to any claim, including any
amount of damages associated therewith, for any purpose. If the estimate of
the Losses and Expenses for all New Matters exceeds $6 million in the
aggregate, Parent shall have the right to refuse to effect the Closing without
liability to Parent or Sub or, in the alternative, to accept such change and
the representations and warranties shall be deemed to take into account such
change(s); _provided_ that, if Parent accepts such change, Parent shall be
entitled to make an indemnification claim for Losses and Expenses up to a
maximum amount of $6 million in the aggregate in accordance with the
provisions of _Article XI_ in respect of such New Matters.



Section 7.5 _Consents of Third Parties; Governmental Approvals_. (a) The
Company will act diligently and reasonably to secure, before the Effective
Time, the consent, approval or waiver, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, from any party to any Company Agreement required to be
obtained to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) neither the Company or the
Subsidiaries nor Parent shall have any obligation to offer or pay any
consideration in order to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver and (ii)
each of the Company and the Subsidiaries shall not make any agreement or
understanding affecting their respective assets or business as a



 

40 condition for obtaining any such consent, approval or waiver except with the
prior written consent of Parent. During the period prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall act diligently and reasonably to cooperate with the Company to
obtain the consents, approvals and waivers contemplated by this _Section
7.5(a)_.



(b) During the period prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto
shall act diligently and reasonably, and shall cooperate with each other, to
secure any consents and approvals of any Governmental Body required to be
obtained by them in order to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to otherwise satisfy the conditions set
forth in _Section 9.4_; _provided_ that each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries shall not make any agreement or understanding affecting their
respective assets or business as a condition for obtaining any such consent
or approval except with the prior written consent of Parent.



Section 7.6 _Conduct of Business Prior to the Effective Time_. (a) Except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause
the Subsidiaries to, operate and carry on the business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries only in the ordinary course and substantially as currently

Dissenters Shares would have been entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1_ at the
Effective Time; or



(viii) any acts or omissions after the date hereof and on or prior to the
Effective Date of the Company, the Subsidiaries or any predecessors thereof or
any Losses and Expenses arising in connection with or out of the operation of
the Companys or the Subsidiaries business after the date hereof and on or
prior to the Effective Date (in each case other than amounts reflected on the
Balance Sheet or in the calculation of Valuation Date Working Capital)
(excluding matters set forth in the Disclosure Schedule as of the date hereof
where any Loss or Expense is readily apparent from the disclosure);



_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent Group Members shall be indemnified and
held harmless under clauses (ii), (iii), (v) and (viii) of this sentence with
respect to Losses and Expenses incurred by Parent Group Members (other than
Losses and Expenses incurred as a result of any inaccuracy of any
representation or breach of any warranty contained in _Section 5.1(a)_,
_5.1(b)_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ , _5.7_ , _5.27_ or _5.30_ , as to which this proviso
shall have no effect) only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such
Losses and Expenses exceeds $3,000,000, but, if in excess of such amount, then
for the entire amount of such Losses and Expenses without deduction.



(b) The indemnification provided for in this _Section 11.1_ shall terminate
on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by
any Parent Group Member under this _Section 11.1_ thereafter), except that

(i) the covenants of the Company set forth in _Sections 14.2_ and _14.12)_ ,
as to all of which no time limit shall apply;



(ii) the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 5.1(a)_ ,

provided in  _Section 11.1(a)(vi)_, as to which the indemnification provided

limitations; and



 

54 (iii) any Loss or Expense of which any Parent Group Member has notified the
Shareholder Representative in accordance with the requirements of _Section
11.3_ on or prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate
in accordance with this _Section 11.1_, as to which the right of the Parent
Group Member to be indemnified shall continue until the liability shall have
been determined pursuant to this _Article XI_ and all Parent Group Members
shall have been reimbursed for the full amount of such Loss and Expense in
accordance with this  _Article XI._



(c) Except with respect to claims for Losses and Expenses incurred by any
Parent Group Member in connection with or arising from any breach of any
warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of the Company contained in
_Section 5.1(a)_, _5.1(b)_ , _5.2_ ,  _5.3_ , _5.7_ , _5.27_ or _5.30_ or
the indemnification provided in _Section 11.1(a)(vi)_, the maximum amount of
Losses and Expenses eligible for indemnification claims pursuant to this
_Section 11.1_ shall not exceed an amount equal to the Indemnification
Escrow Amount.



(d) With respect to claims for Losses and Expenses incurred by any Parent
Group Member in connection with or arising from any breach of any warranty or
the inaccuracy of any representation of the Company contained in  _Section
5.1(a)_, _5.1(b)_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ , _5.7_ , _5.27_ or _5.30_ or the
indemnification provided in _Section 11.1(a)(vi)_, the maximum amount of
Losses and Expenses eligible for indemnification claims pursuant to this
_Section 11.1_ shall not exceed an amount as set forth in the Indemnification
Agreement.



Section 11.2 _Indemnification of Shareholder Group Members_. (a) Subject to
the provisions of this _Article XI_ , from and after the Effective Time, each
Shareholder Group Member shall be indemnified and held harmless by Parent from
and against any and all Losses and Expenses incurred by any such Shareholder
Group Member in connection with or arising from:

 



(i) any breach by Parent or Sub of any of its covenants, or any failure of
Parent or Sub to perform any of its obligations, in this Agreement or in any
Parent Ancillary Agreement; or



(ii) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of
Parent or Sub contained or referred to in this Agreement or any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of Parent or Sub pursuant hereto (it being
understood that for purposes of this _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_, except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.4 or 6.7(a),
such representations and warranties shall be interpreted without giving
effect to any limitations or qualifications as to "materiality" (including the
word "material") or "material adverse effect" set forth therein); 



_provided_ , _however_ , that Shareholder Group Members shall be indemnified
and held harmless under clause (ii) of this Section 11.2 with respect to
Losses and Expenses incurred by Shareholder Group Members (other than Losses
and Expenses incurred as a result of any inaccuracy of any representation
or breach of any warranty contained in ___Section 6.1_ __, _6.2(a)_ ,
_6.2(b)_ , _6.3_ or _6.6_ , as to which this proviso shall have no effect)
only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses
exceeds $3,000,000, but, if in excess of such amount, then for the entire
amount of such Losses and Expenses without deduction.



 

55 (b) The indemnification provided for in this _Section 11.2_ shall terminate
on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by
any Shareholder Group Member under this _Section 11.2_ thereafter), except
that the indemnification of Shareholder Group Members shall continue as to any
Loss or Expense of which the Shareholder Representative has notified Parent
in accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.3_ on or prior to the date
such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with this
_Section 11.2_, as to which the right of the Shareholder Group Member to be
indemnified shall continue until the liability shall have been determined
pursuant to this _Article XI_ and all Shareholder Group Members shall have
been reimbursed for the full amount of such Loss and Expense in accordance
with this _Article XI_.



(c) Except with respect to claims for Losses and Expenses incurred by any
Shareholder Group Member in connection with or arising from any breach of any
warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of Parent contained in
_Section 6.1_ , _6.2(a)_ , _6.2(b)_ , _6.3_ or _6.6_ , the maximum amount of
Losses and Expenses eligible for indemnification claims pursuant to this
Section 11.2 shall not exceed an amount equal to $27,500,000. With respect to
claims for Losses and Expenses incurred by any Shareholder Group Member in

of any representation of Parent contained in _Section 6.1_ , _6.2(a)_ ,
_6.2(b)_ , _6.3_ or  _6.6_ , the maximum amount of Losses and Expenses
eligible for indemnification claims pursuant to this _Section 11.2_ shall not
exceed an amount equal to $58,500,000.



Section 11.3 _Notice of Claims_. (a) Any Parent Group Member seeking
indemnification hereunder shall give to the Shareholder Representative, and
any Shareholder Group Member seeking indemnification hereunder shall give to
Parent, a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable
detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder and
shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of
computation of the amount of such claim and a reference to the provision of
this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument executed
hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based. A Claim
Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third
Person as to which indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly
after the action or suit is commenced. The failure of any indemnified party
to give the Claim Notice promptly as required by this _Section 11.3_ shall
not affect such indemnified partys rights under this _Article XI_ except to
the extent such failure is actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations
of the indemnifying party.



(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an indemnified party shall be entitled under this
_Article XI_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party (with such indemnifying party, in
the case of the Shareholders, being the Shareholder Representative); (ii) by a
final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; (iii) by an
Award; or (iv) by any other means to which the applicable indemnified party
and the indemnifying party (with such indemnifying party, in the case of the
Shareholders, being the Shareholder Representative) shall agree. The judgment
or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any,
shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals
taken shall have been finally determined.



 

56 Section 11.4 _Third-Party Claims_. (a) With respect to any third Person claim,
action or suit (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against the indemnified party
hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in such
Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that such indemnifying party wishes
(unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to such Third-Party Claim
and the indemnified party determines in good faith that joint representation
would be inappropriate or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide
reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity to
defend such Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such
Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and, after written notice from the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party will not, as long
as such indemnifying party diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
indemnified party under this _Article XI_ for any fees of other counsel or any
other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each
case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of
investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that if there exists or is reasonably
likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate for
the same counsel to represent both the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party under applicable standards of professional conduct based upon the advice
of counsel, then the indemnified party shall be entitled to retain its own
counsel, as well as local counsel in each jurisdiction for which the
indemnified party reasonably determines such local counsel is required, at the
expense of the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) it shall be conclusively established for
purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in such Third-Party Claim are
within the scope of and subject to indemnification to the extent
adversely determined subject to the limitations set forth herein; (ii) no
compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim may be effected by the
indemnifying party without the indemnified partys written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless (A) there is no
finding or admission of any violation of any Requirement of Law or any
violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that
may be made against the indemnified party and (B) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party; (iii) the
indemnified party will have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such claims effected without its written consent when such
consent is required hereunder; and (iv) no compromise or settlement of such
Third-Party Claim may be effected by the indemnified party without the
indemnifying partys written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If a Claim Notice is given to an indemnifying party of
the commencement of any Third-Party Claim and the indemnifying party does not,
within 20 days after the indemnified partys Claim Notice is given,
give written notice to the indemnified party of its election to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party will be bound by any
determination made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or settlement
effected by the indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
indemnifying party shall not be precluded from otherwise participating in, or
assuming the defense of, such Third-Party Claim as permitted by this _Section
11.4(a)_.

 



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may
adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than solely as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying



 

57 party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-
Party Claim, but the indemnifying party shall not be bound by any
determination of a Third-Party Claim so defended or any compromise or
settlement effected without its written consent (which may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).



Section 11.5 _Indemnification Escrow Amount as Security; Set-Off._ Any amount
of indemnification that a Parent Group Member is determined to be entitled to
be paid pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall first be paid out of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement. To the extent that the amount of Losses and Expenses to be
indemnified pursuant to this _Article XI_ exceeds the amount of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, the amount of such excess Losses and Expenses
shall be paid directly to the appropriate Parent Group Member in accordance
with the terms of the Indemnification Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
payment of such excess Losses and Expenses is subject to the limitations
contained in this  _Article XI_.



Section 11.6 _Allocation of Significant Shareholder Indemnification
Responsibilities_. Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 11.1_,
recovery pursuant to the Indemnification Agreements from each Significant
Shareholder will be limited to such Significant Shareholders Applicable
Percentage of Losses and Expenses recoverable by Parent Group Members under
_Section 11.1_. For purposes of this _Article XI_ , the " _Applicable
Percentage_ " for each Significant Shareholder shall be calculated as the
percentage ownership interest in the Companys outstanding capital stock,
calculated on an as-converted basis immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and shall be as set forth beside such Significant Shareholders name on
_Exhibit J_ , which Exhibit shall be delivered to Parent by the Company at the
Closing. In no event shall the allocation of indemnification responsibility
under this _Section 11.6_ in any way be deemed to expand the indemnity
obligation of any Significant Shareholder after taking into account all limits
on indemnification established hereunder.



Section 11.7 _Limitations on Computation of Losses and Expenses_. (a) Under no
circumstances shall an indemnifying party be liable for claims by the
indemnified party that, as a consequence of the indemnifying partys breach,
the indemnified party has incurred consequential, punitive, exemplary or
special damages unless such damages have actually been paid by
the indemnified party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim. No Parent Group Member
shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses or Expenses incurred or
paid resulting from, or arising out of, any claim or liability to the extent
such claim or liability in question does not exceed the amount of any reserve
or accrual contained in the calculation of Valuation Date Working Capital
specifically identified as relating to such claim or liability.



(b) Parent Group Members shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
recover any Losses or Expenses that are recoverable pursuant to a claim under
any insurance policy or Acquisition Agreement. To the extent that any Parent
Group Member receives any indemnification payment hereunder with respect to
any Losses or Expenses and such Parent Group Member also actually receives
with respect to such Losses or Expenses any insurance proceeds or actually
recovers with respect to such Losses or Expenses any amount under any
Acquisition Agreement, such Parent Group Member shall reimburse the
Indemnification Escrow Amount or the Significant Shareholders, as appropriate,
the amount of such proceeds or such recovery to the extent of any duplicative
payment after deduction for (a) any increased insurance costs as a result of
such recovery and (b) any fees, costs or expenses incurred by such Parent
Group Member in connection with obtaining such proceeds or such recovery.



 

58 Section 11.8 _Exclusivity_. If the Closing occurs, except for remedies that
cannot be waived as a matter of law and injunctive and provisional relief
(including specific performance), the remedies provided by this _Article XI_
(including by virtue of the Indemnification Agreement) shall be exclusive of
any other rights or remedies which might otherwise be available to a party
upon the occurrence of any event described in this _Article XI_ or for
breaches of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall preclude the assertion by any Parent Group Member or
Shareholder Group Member of any cause of action that may exist for fraud or
for intentional misrepresentation.



ARTICLE XII

_provided_ _further_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 12.1(e)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of the
Effective Time not



 

59 occurring on or prior to such date; and _provided_ _further_ that, if the

_Section 7.9_, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 12.1(f)_ unless (i) the Company has delivered to
Parent a written notice of the Companys intent to enter into such
an agreement to effect the Superior Proposal, together with the most current
version of such agreement (it being understood that such version shall be
updated on a current basis and that such notice shall be given by the Company
to Parent following each material amendment or modification of the terms of
such agreement), (ii) five business days have elapsed following delivery to
Parent by the Company of the written notice accompanied by the most current

the Company has fully cooperated with Parent, including informing Parent (to
the extent not otherwise done so pursuant to clause (ii) or _Section 7.9(b)_)
of the terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal (including any
amendments or modifications thereof), with the intent of enabling Parent to
agree to a modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be effected; _provided_ , _further_
, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
12.1(f)_ unless at the end of each five business day-period the Board of
Directors of the Company continues reasonably to believe that the Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company, prior to or
concurrently with such termination, pays to Parent in cash an amount equal to
$12,000,000. The Company agrees (x) that it will not enter into a definitive
agreement concerning such Takeover Proposal earlier than the sixth day after
it has provided the notice to Parent required by clause (i) and (y) to notify
Parent promptly in writing if its intention to enter into a
definitive agreement referred to in its notification shall change at any time
after giving such notification; or



(g) by Parent if Parent shall not have received the Required Financial
Information on or prior to February 1, 2006 and Parent shall not have
received the Additional Required Financial Information on or prior to May 30,
2006 (or such later date as may be mutually agreed to by all of the parties
hereto).

Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other parties to this Agreement.



Section 12.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement shall

breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either Parent or
the Company is entitled to



 

60 and terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1(e)_ at a time when
(i) all of the conditions to closing set forth in _Article IX_ have been
satisfied other than the condition contained in _Section 9.11_, (ii) the
Company has fully complied in all material respects with _Sections 7.11_ and
_7.12_ and (iii) the Company is not in breach of this Agreement, which breach
has materially contributed to the failure of the condition contained in
_Section 9.11_ to have been satisfied, then within five business days after
the date of such termination Parent will pay to the Company cash in an amount
equal to $7,500,000.



ARTICLE XIII

SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE MATTERS



Section 13.1 _Representations and Warranties_. The Shareholder Representative
represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:



(a) The Shareholder Representative has all requisite power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and all agreements, instruments
and documents being or to be executed and delivered by the Shareholder
Representative under this Agreement (the " _Shareholder Representative
Ancillary Agreements_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by the Shareholder Representative and (assuming the valid authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent, Sub and
the Company) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder
Representative enforceable in accordance with its terms, and upon execution
and delivery by the Shareholder Representative each of the Shareholder
Representative Ancillary Agreements will be (assuming the valid
authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other parties thereto) a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder Representative
enforceable in accordance with its terms, all except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by
the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).



(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the
Shareholder Representative Ancillary Agreements nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby:



(i) conflict with, result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions
of, or constitute a default, an event of default or an event creating rights
of acceleration, termination or cancellation or a loss of rights under, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any of
the Shareholder Representatives assets, under (A) any note, instrument,
mortgage, agreement, lease, franchise, license, permit or other authorization,
right, restriction or obligation to which the Shareholder Representative is a
party or any of the Shareholder Representatives assets or business is
subject or by which the Shareholder Representative is bound, (B) any Court
Order to which the Shareholder Representative is a party or by which any of
the Shareholder Representatives assets or business is subject or by which
the Shareholder Representative is bound or (C) any Requirements of Law
applicable to the Shareholder Representative or the Shareholder
Representatives assets or business; or 



 

61 (ii) require the approval, consent, authorization or act of, or the making by
the Shareholder Representative of any declaration, filing or registration
with, any Governmental Body.



Section 13.2 _Appointment_. (a) In order to efficiently (i) administer the
obligations specified in _Sections 2.3_ and  _2.4_ , including the
determination of the Estimated Working Capital and Valuation Date Working
Capital, and _Article XI_ and (ii) efficiently represent the interests of
Shareholders with respect to all matters arising under this Agreement or any
Shareholder Representative Ancillary Agreements, (A) by virtue of the approval
of this Agreement and the Merger (and no act of such Shareholder), each
Shareholder appoints the Shareholder Representative as agent for
such Shareholder and as such Shareholders true and lawful attorney-in-fact
effective upon the approval of the Merger, with full power and authority in
such Shareholders name and on such Shareholders behalf to (x) act according
to the terms of this Agreement and the Shareholder Representative Ancillary
Agreements in the absolute discretion of the Shareholder Representative, (y)
represent such Shareholder and such Shareholders successors with respect to
all matters arising under this Agreement and the Shareholder Representative
Ancillary Agreements and (z) in general to do all things and to perform all
acts, including executing and delivering any agreements, certificates,
receipts, instructions, notices or instruments contemplated by or deemed
advisable in connection with this Agreement or any Shareholder Representative
Ancillary Agreement and (B) the Shareholder Representative agrees to act as
the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of each Shareholder. Each
Shareholder agrees, by virtue of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger
(and no act of such Shareholder), that all actions taken by the Shareholder
Representative under the Merger Agreement or any Shareholder Representative
Ancillary Agreement shall be binding upon such Shareholder and such
Shareholders successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by
such Shareholder.



(b) The power of attorney and all authority conferred under _Section 13.2(a)_
shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any
Shareholder, by operation of law, by such Shareholders death or disability or
any other event. Without limiting the foregoing, the power of attorney shall
be to ensure the performance of a special obligation and, accordingly, each
Shareholder, by virtue of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger (and
no act of such Shareholder), renounces such Shareholders right to renounce
this power of attorney unilaterally any time before the termination of the
Escrow Agreement.



(c) By virtue of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger (and no act of
such Shareholder), each Shareholder waives any and all defenses which may be
available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Shareholder
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or any Shareholder
Representative Ancillary Agreement.



(d) Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted under _Section 13.2(a)_,
no agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or document shall be
ineffective by reason of a Shareholder having signed or given such directly
instead of the Shareholder Representative.



(e) The Shareholder Representative agrees to be bound by all obligations of
the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement or any Shareholder
Representative Ancillary Agreement and shall take any and all actions which
the Shareholder Representative



 

62 believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement or any Shareholder
Representative Ancillary Agreement for and on behalf of the Shareholders,
including defending all indemnity claims pursuant to _Section 11.1_ (each, an
" _Indemnity Claim_ "), consenting to, compromising or settling all Indemnity
Claims, conducting negotiations with Parent and its agents regarding
Indemnity Claims, dealing with Parent, Sub and the Company under this
Agreement and the Shareholder Representative Ancillary Agreements with respect
to all matters arising hereunder or thereunder, taking any and all other
actions of the Shareholder Representative specified in or contemplated by this
Agreement or any the Shareholder Representative Ancillary Agreement and
engaging counsel and accountants in connection with the foregoing matters.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by virtue of the approval
of this Agreement and the Merger (and no act of such Shareholder), each
Shareholder grants the Shareholder Representative full power and authority to
interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Shareholder
Representative Ancillary Agreements and to consent to any amendment hereof or
thereof on behalf of such Shareholder and its successors.



Section 13.3 _Indemnification of Shareholder Representative; Expenses_. (a)
The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable in connection with the
performance by the Shareholder Representative of the Shareholder
Representatives duties pursuant to this Agreement or any Shareholder
Representative Ancillary Agreement, except for the Shareholder
Representatives own willful misconduct or gross negligence. By virtue of the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger and no other act of any Shareholder,
the Shareholder Representative shall be indemnified and held
harmless, jointly and severally, by each Shareholder from all Losses and
Expenses that may be incurred by the Shareholder Representative as a result of
the Shareholder Representatives performance of the Shareholder
Representatives duties under this Agreement or any Shareholder
Representative Ancillary Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Shareholder Representative shall not be entitled to indemnification for Losses
and Expenses that result from any action taken or omitted by the Shareholder

Section 14.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement and the Exhibits
and Schedules (including the Disclosure Schedule) referred to herein and the

disclosure under the corresponding section; _provided_ that any matter or
item disclosed in one schedule in the Disclosure Schedule will be deemed
disclosed with respect to another schedule in the Disclosure Schedule if such
disclosure is made in such a way as to make its relevance with respect to such
other schedule readily apparent. Titles to Articles and headings of Sections

sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any
party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such
party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in

right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No

shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to
the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction
would be unreasonable.



Section 14.11 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original

of, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers, immunities and franchises
of Sub and the Company and otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed

in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment upon the
award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having

National Roster in accordance with AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules. The law
applicable to the arbitration, including the administration and enforcement
thereof, shall be the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, and the law
governing this Agreement. The non-prevailing party in any arbitration shall
bear the cost of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the
arbitrator and shall be responsible for its own and the prevailing partys
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration.
Each party shall bear the cost of preparing and presenting its case;

Shareholder Representative for the Shareholder Representatives cost of
preparing and presenting its case up to an amount equal to $50,000 _minus_ the

the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.3_. The arbitration award
(the " _Award_ ") shall be presented to the parties in writing, and

Representative may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision,
apply to any court having jurisdiction hereof and seek interim provisional,
injunctive or other equitable relief until the Award is rendered or the
controversy is otherwise resolved. Except as required by applicable
Requirements of Law and except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce
this arbitration provision or any Award, or to obtain interim relief, neither
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Shareholder Representative nor an
arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration
