withholding was made.

holders of Convertible Interests or Incentive Units shall be entitled to look
to the Surviving Company only as general creditors thereof with respect to any

Reserves_ "), (vii) the Credit Agreement Payoff Amount and the
aggregate amount of all other Indebtedness of any of the Transferred Entities
(other than the WP Notes Amount) (the " _Closing Indebtedness_ "), (viii) the
Deferred Compensation Amount (the " _Closing Deferred Compensation Amount_ ")
and (ix) the Non-Consenting Client Adjustment (the " _Closing Non-Consenting

(b) Within sixty (60) days after delivery by Purchaser of the Post-Closing
Statement, during which period Purchaser shall provide reasonable access to
such working papers, information and personnel relating to the preparation of
the applicable documents as may be reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative, the Sellers Representative may dispute all or a portion of
the calculations of the items set forth on the Final Closing Statement by
giving written notice (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Purchaser setting
forth in reasonable detail each item on the Post-Closing Statement that
the Sellers Representative disputes, a summary of the reasons for such
dispute and the Sellers Representatives calculation of each such item (any
such dispute, a " _Disagreement_ "). If the Sellers Representative does not
provide a Notice of Disagreement to Purchaser within the sixty (60)-day period
set forth above, the Sellers Representative shall be deemed to have (on
behalf of each former holder of Convertible Interests or Incentive
Units) irrevocably accepted such non-disputed items and calculations as set
forth in the Post-Closing Statement. Further, any item not included as
disputed in such Notice of Disagreement shall be deemed accepted by the
Sellers Representative and the Sellers.

(c) Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall promptly commence good
faith negotiations with a view to resolving all Disagreements not accepted or
deemed accepted by the Sellers Representative. Any Disagreements that cannot
be resolved between Purchaser and the Sellers Representative relating to the
Post-Closing Statement (as evidenced by a written agreement between Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative) within the thirty (30) days following the
delivery to Purchaser of the Notice of Disagreement shall thereafter be
referred to the Independent Accounting Firm for a resolution of such
Disagreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Purchaser and the
Sellers Representative shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm that
the determinations of such firm with respect to any Disagreement shall be
rendered within 15 days after referral of the Disagreement to such firm or

 



-38-  as soon thereafter as reasonably possible. Such determinations shall only be
made with respect to the items that remain the subject of the Disagreement on
the basis of written position papers submitted by Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative (i.e., not on the basis of independent review), shall with
respect to each item be made within the range of the disputed amounts claimed
by Purchaser and the Sellers Representative in the position papers
submitted, and shall be final and binding upon the Parties. Each of Purchaser
and the Sellers Representative shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Independent Accounting Firm to render its determination within the 15-day
period described above, and each shall cooperate with such firm and provide
such firm with reasonable access to the books, records, personnel and
representatives of it and such other information as such firm may reasonably
require in order to render its determination. All of the fees and expenses of
any Independent Accounting Firm retained pursuant to this _Section 2.10_
shall be allocated between the Sellers Representative, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the items unsuccessfully disputed or defended, as the case may be,
by each (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to
the total amount of the disputed items. 

(d) _Final Closing Statement_. The Post-Closing Statement and/or any items,
amounts or calculations set forth thereon shall become final and binding upon
the Parties upon the earliest of (i) the acceptance or deemed acceptance of
any items, amounts or calculations set forth in the Post-Closing Statement or
as modified in the manner described in the Notice of Disagreement, in
accordance with _Section 2.10(b)_, (ii) the written agreement between
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative with respect thereto and (iii) the
decision by the Independent Accounting Firm with respect to
the Disagreements. The Post-Closing Statement, at such time as all items,
amounts and calculations set forth thereon shall have been as accepted or
deemed accepted, or as modified or adjusted pursuant to the Notice of
Disagreement, any written agreement of Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative or the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm, when final
and binding, is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Statement_ ," and
the " _Final Closing Adjustment Amount_ " shall mean (i) the Closing Working
Capital; _plus_ (ii) an amount equal to the Closing Unaccrued Receivables
Adjustment; _plus_ (iii) an amount equal to the Closing Houston Adjustment
Amount; _minus _ (iv) an amount equal to the Closing Transaction Expenses;
_minus_ (v) an amount equal to the Closing Change of Control Payments; _minus_
(vi) an amount equal to the Closing Holdback Reserves; _minus_ (vii)
an amount equal to the Closing Deferred Compensation Amount; _minus_ (vii) an
amount equal to the Closing Indebtedness; and _minus_ (ix) an amount equal to
the Closing Non-Consenting Client Adjustment, in each case as set forth
on the Final Closing Statement.

(e) _Final Closing Adjustment Amount_. As soon as practicable (but not more
than three (3) Business Days) after the final determination of the Final
Closing Adjustment Amount:

(i) If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount (such difference in absolute terms, the " _Excess Payment_
"), Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent Joint Release Instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to pay, to the
extent of the True-Up Escrow Account balance, an

 



-39-  amount equal to the Excess Payment out of the True-Up Escrow Account to one
or more bank accounts designated by Purchaser. To the extent that after such
payment funds remain in the True-Up Escrow Account, Purchaser and Sellers
Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent Joint Release Instructions
instructing the Escrow Agent to deposit such remaining balance in the Escrow
Account. To the extent that the Excess Payment exceeds the True-Up Escrow
Account balance, Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent Joint Release Instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to
pay, to the extent of the Escrow Account balance, an amount equal to
the amount by which the Excess Payment exceeds the True-Up Escrow Account
balance (and, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser may not recover any amount
from Sellers in excess of the Escrow Account balance); or

 

(ii) If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is greater than the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount (such difference in absolute terms, the " _True-Up
Shortfall_ "), then (A) Purchaser shall pay an amount in cash equal to the
True-Up Shortfall, but in no event greater than the True-Up Ceiling, to each
former holder of shares or units, as applicable, of Convertible Interests and
Incentive Units in accordance with the instructions of the Sellers
Representative (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be payable pro rata in
accordance with the number of Membership Units beneficially owned by such
holders immediately prior to the First Effective Time, or such other
proportion as is required to cause such payment to be distributed in
accordance with Section 7.1 of the LLC Agreement) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more bank accounts designated by the
Sellers Representative, and (B) Purchaser and Sellers Representative shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent Joint Release Instructions instructing the Escrow
Agent to pay the True-Up Escrow Amount to each former holder of shares or
units, as applicable, of Convertible Interests and Incentive Units (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, will be payable pro rata in accordance with the number
of Membership Units beneficially owned by such holders immediately prior to
the First Effective Time, or such other proportion as is required to cause
such payment to be distributed in accordance with Section 7.1 of the LLC
Agreement) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
bank accounts designated by the Sellers Representative.

2.11 _Holdback True-Up_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after (i) each anniversary of the Closing Date
and (ii) the date that all holdbacks that may or have become payable pursuant
to the Holdback Agreements have been finally determined in accordance with all
applicable Holdback Agreements (each such date, a " _Holdback Determination
Date_ "), and in any event not later than 15 Business Days after the Holdback
Determination Date, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers Representative a
written statement (each, a " _Holdback Statement_ ") setting forth, for any
holdback that has been finally determined pursuant to the terms, and subject
to the conditions and limitations, of the applicable Holdback Agreements
(each, a " _Final Holdback Payment_ ") since the most recent preceding
Holdback Determination Date, the Holdback Agreement pursuant to which each
such

 



-40-  Final Holdback Payment has been finally determined the amount of each such
Final Holdback Payment, and a calculation of the amount of each such Final
Holdback Payment and the inputs and components of such calculation in
reasonable detail. The " _Holdback Shortfall_ " means the amount by which a
Holdback Reserve exceeds the corresponding Final Holdback Payment, if any.
Purchasers obligations under this  _Section 2.11(a)_ shall continue until
such time that Purchaser shall have delivered a Holdback Statement with
respect to all holdbacks that may or have become payable pursuant to the
Holdback Agreements in accordance with this  _Section 2.11(a)_.

(b) Within thirty (30) days after delivery by Purchaser of any Holdback
Statement, during which period Purchaser shall provide reasonable access to
such working papers, information and personnel relating to its determination
of any applicable Final Holdback Payment as may be reasonably requested by the
Sellers Representative, the Sellers Representative may dispute all or a
portion of any Final Holdback Payment calculation by giving written notice (a
" _Holdback Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Purchaser setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for any such dispute (any such dispute, a "
_Holdback Disagreement_ "). The Sellers Representative shall be deemed to
have (on behalf of each former holder of Convertible Interests or Incentive
Units) irrevocably accepted the calculations with respect to any Final
Holdback Payment, as set forth in the Holdback Statement, which it does not
dispute by way of a Holdback Notice of Disagreement provided to Purchaser
within the 30-day period set forth above. Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative shall promptly commence good faith negotiations with a view to
resolving all Holdback Disagreements not accepted or deemed accepted by the
Sellers Representative, and if Purchaser and the Sellers Representative do
not resolve the Holdback Disagreement (as evidenced by a written agreement
between Purchaser and the Sellers Representative) within 30 days of receipt
by Purchaser of the Holdback Notice of Disagreement, Purchaser and the
Sellers Representative shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm that
the determinations of such firm with respect to any Holdback Disagreement
shall be rendered within 15 days after referral of the Holdback Disagreement
to such firm or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible. Such
determinations shall only be made with respect to the items that remain the
subject of the Holdback Disagreement on the basis of written position papers
submitted by Purchaser and the Sellers Representative (i.e., not on
the basis of independent review), shall with respect to each item be made
within the range of the disputed amounts claimed by Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative in the position papers submitted, and shall be final and
binding upon the Parties. Each of Purchaser and the Sellers Representative
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm
to render its determination within the 15-day period described above, and each
shall cooperate with such firm and provide such firm with reasonable access
to the books, records, personnel and representatives of it and such other
information as such firm may reasonably require in order to render its
determination. All of the fees and expenses of any Independent Accounting
Firm retained pursuant to this _Section 2.11_ shall be allocated between the
Sellers Representative, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, in
the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the items unsuccessfully
disputed or defended, as the case may be, by each (as finally determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of the disputed
items.

 

(c) Within three (3) Business Days after the final determination of any Final
Holdback Payment pursuant to this _Section 2.11_, if there is a Holdback
Shortfall that is a positive number, Purchaser shall pay such Holdback
Shortfall in cash to the Sellers Representative for distribution to each
former holder of shares or units, as applicable, of Convertible Interests and
Incentive Units in accordance with the instructions of the Sellers
Representative (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be payable pro rata in
accordance with the number of Membership Units beneficially owned by such
holders immediately prior to the First Effective Time, or such other
proportion as is required to cause such payment to be distributed in
accordance with Section 7.1 of the LLC Agreement) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more bank accounts designated by the
Sellers Representative.

KC Blocker Disclosure Schedule, there are no equity or unitholder agreements,

willful material failure to comply or perform and, in any case, (i) such

ARTICLE VIII

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

8.1  _Treatment of Employees_.

(a) From the Closing Date through and including December 31, 2016, Purchaser
shall, except as otherwise provided in an employment agreement with such
Company Employee, provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Company
Employee who remains employed by the Company, Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries immediately after the Closing Date (each a " _Continuing
Employee_ "): (i) base compensation and annual bonus opportunities that, in
each case, are no less favorable than were provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately before Closing; and (ii) employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than were provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately before the Closing, but disregarding for purposes of this sentence
the value of any equity-based compensation, change-in-control incentives and
post-employment health benefits. In addition, in connection with Parents
integration of the Continuing Employees during 2016, the Continuing Employees
shall be offered other compensation which is substantially comparable to
that which Parent provides to similarly situated employees. Purchaser shall
also cause the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to provide to each
Continuing Employee (other than a Continuing Employee subject to an employment
agreement providing for more favorable severance benefits) whose employment
terminates prior to December 31, 2016 severance benefits equal to the
severance benefits provided to similarly situated employees under the
severance arrangements of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, and from the
Closing Date through and including December 31, 2016, severance benefits
offered to each Continuing Employee shall be determined without taking into
account any reduction after the Closing in compensation paid to such
Continuing Employee.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employees
after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with Sellers and their Subsidiaries
and their respective predecessors before the Closing, to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Closing and such service is reflected in the service records provided by
Company to Purchaser; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits or to
accrual of benefits under a defined benefit plan. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any Company Benefit Plan
providing medical, dental, 

 



-91-  pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to Continuing Employees is not
maintained through December 31, 2016 with substantially the same terms
existing immediately prior to the Closing Date (each such Company Benefit
Plan, a " _Mid-Year Terminated Plan_ "), then the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the New Plan providing corresponding
benefits to (i) permit each such employee to immediately participate, without
any waiting time and (ii) waive all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan for such employee and his or
her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the Mid-Year Terminated Plan in which such employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing, and Purchaser shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Mid-Year Terminated Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins shall
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

8.2 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this _Article VIII_ are
solely for the benefit of the Parties and are not intended to confer upon any
other Persons any rights or remedies hereunder. Except as provided in
_Sections 7.7_ , _7.8_ and _7.10_ , nothing in this Agreement shall preclude
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, at any time after the Closing, from
terminating the employment of any employee or amending, merging, modifying,
terminating, eliminating, reducing or otherwise altering in any respect any
Company Benefit Plan, any benefit under any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or
any trust, insurance policy or funding vehicle related to any Company Benefit
Plan or New Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of Company
Benefit Plan in the immediately preceding sentence does not include any rights
to indemnification under Section 7.7 and any related agreements or underlying
insurance policies.

ARTICLE IX

 

TAX MATTERS

9.1 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_ . Sellers and Purchaser agree
to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly
as practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and
assistance relating to the Transferred Entities as is reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns and the
preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any Tax Proceeding. Such
information and assistance shall include providing necessary powers of
attorney, copies of all relevant portions of all relevant Tax Returns,
together with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying schedules and
work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
any Taxing authority and relevant records which any such party may possess.

9.2 _Transfer Taxes_ . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Sellers, on the one hand (with each Seller in accordance with its
Pro Rata Portion) and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall each pay, when due,
and be responsible for, 50% of any sales, use, transfer, gains,
documentary, stamp, value added or similar Taxes and related fees imposed on
or payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

 



-92-  (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). The Party responsible under applicable Law for
filing the Tax Returns with respect to any such Transfer Taxes shall prepare
and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such Tax
Return to the other Parties. The Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare
and file any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes,
including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or
imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

9.3  _Certain Tax Returns_.

(a) The KC Blocker Sellers shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely
file (or cause to be timely filed) any Tax Return required to be filed by any
of the KC Blocker Entities prior to the Closing Date (taking into account
extensions). The Company shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely
file (or cause to be timely filed) any Tax Return required to be filed by any
of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date (taking into account
extensions).

(b) Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the
Transferred Entities that are due after the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return
that is for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (including,
without limitation, in the case of the Company, IRS Form 1065 and related
Schedules K-1 (and any similar or corresponding state income Tax Return)) (a "
_Pre-Closing Tax Return_ ") or for a Straddle Period (a " _Straddle Period Tax
Return_ "), shall be prepared in a manner consistent with _Section 9.3(c)_
and, except as otherwise required pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_, in a manner
consistent with the past practices of the relevant Transferred Entity and the
LLC Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time.
Purchaser shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) a draft of each Pre-Closing
Tax Return and each Straddle Period Tax Return to the Sellers Representative
for its review and comment no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date (taking into account extensions) for such Tax Return. In the case of any
Pre-Closing Tax Return that (x) could (or the filing of which could) result in
a material Tax Liability of any Seller (or any direct or indirect owner of
any Seller) or give rise to a material indemnification obligation of any
Seller hereunder (taking into account the funds remaining in the Escrow
Account) and (y) could not result in a material Tax Liability of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (a " _Seller Pre-Closing Tax Return_ "), Purchaser shall
reflect (or cause to be reflected) any comments provided by the Sellers
Representative on any such Seller Pre-Closing Tax Return prior to the filing
thereof and Purchaser shall timely file (or cause to be timely filed) (taking
into account extensions) such Seller Pre-Closing Tax Return (as so revised to
reflect the comments provided by the Sellers Representative). In the case of
any Pre-Closing Tax Return (other than a Seller Pre-Closing Tax Return) or any
Straddle Period Return, in each case, that could (or the filing of which
could) result in a Tax Liability of any Seller (or any direct or indirect
owner of any Seller) or give rise to an indemnification obligation of any
Seller hereunder (taking into account the funds remaining in the Escrow
Account) (a " _Shared Return_ "), Purchaser shall consider in good faith
any comments provided by the Sellers Representative no later than ten (10)
days prior to the due date therefor (taking into account extensions). If
Purchaser disagrees with any comments provided by the Sellers Representative
on any Shared Return, Purchaser and the Sellers

 



-93-  Representative shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disagreement
prior to the due date for such Shared Return (taking into account extensions).
If Purchaser and the Sellers Representative are unable to reach agreement
with respect to any Shared Return prior to the due date therefor (taking into
account extensions), (x) Purchaser shall timely file (or cause to be timely
filed) such Shared Return as prepared by Purchaser (and reflecting any
comments provided by the Sellers Representative with which Purchaser agrees),
(y) the Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall thereafter promptly cause
the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes, and (z)
Purchaser shall amend (or cause to be amended) such Shared Return to reflect
the resolution of the Independent Accounting Firm. Any resolution of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall reflect and be consistent with the terms of
this Agreement and any fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be borne equally by the Sellers Representative, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand. Except to the extent required pursuant to this 
_Section 9.3(b)_ in the case of a Shared Return, Purchaser shall not amend or
revoke (or permit any of its Affiliates to amend or revoke) any Pre-Closing
Tax Return or any Straddle Period Tax Return (or any notification or
election relating thereto) without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). At
the request of the Sellers Representative, Purchaser shall file (or cause to
be filed) amended Seller Pre-Closing Tax Returns.

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any deduction arising in
respect of the Liquidity Payment (as defined in the Phantom Equity Letter
Agreement) shall be reflected on the IRS Form 1065 and related Schedules K-1
(and any similar or corresponding state income Tax Return) of the Company for
the last taxable period of the Company ending on or before the Closing Date
and such deduction shall be specially allocated to Management Blocker.

9.4 _Certain Refunds_. Sellers shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of
any Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to this Agreement.
Any refunds or credits of Taxes in respect of any Straddle Period shall be
equitably apportioned between Sellers and Purchaser in accordance with the
principles set forth in _Section 9.7_ and the first sentence of this _Section
9.4_. Purchaser shall pay (or cause its Affiliates to pay) to the Sellers
Representative for distribution to the appropriate Sellers the amount of any
refund or credit (including any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes to
the party receiving such refund or credit in respect of the receipt or accrual
of such refund or credit) in readily available funds within fifteen (15) days
of the receipt of such refund or credit or the application of such refund or
credit against amounts otherwise payable; _provided_ that Purchaser shall be
entitled to offset any amounts otherwise payable by Purchaser pursuant to
this _Section 9.4_ (x) in respect of any refunds or credits of any KC Blocker
Entity by an amount necessary to satisfy any outstanding indemnification
obligation due and owing to any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 11.2(b)(i)_ in respect of a breach of any representation or warranty
set forth in _Section 3.9_ or _Section 11.2(b)(iii)_ and (y) in respect of
any refunds or credits of any Acquired Company by an amount necessary to
satisfy any outstanding indemnification obligation due and owing to any
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ in respect of a
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in  _Section 5.13_ or
Section _11.2(a)(iii)_.

 



-94- 9.5 _Reorganization_. Each of the Purchaser, KC Blocker, and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the First Merger and the Second
Merger, taken together, to qualify, and to take no action which would cause
the First Merger and the Second Merger, taken together, not to qualify, as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of
the Purchaser, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 1A, KC Blocker and the Company shall
deliver to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz or Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman,
as applicable, an officers certificate, dated as of the Closing Date,
containing such customary statements and representations as may be necessary
or appropriate to enable Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz or Pillsbury Winthrop
Shaw Pittman, as applicable, to deliver the opinion described in _Section
10.2(d)_.

9.6 _Tax Contests_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers Representative in writing
upon receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of a written notice of any
pending or threatened Tax Proceeding which, if pursued successfully, could
give rise to a Tax Liability of any Seller or an indemnity obligation of any
Seller hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that no failure or delay by
Purchaser to provide notice of any such Tax Proceeding shall reduce or
otherwise affect the obligation of the Sellers hereunder except to the extent
that the relevant Seller or Sellers are actually prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) If such Tax Proceeding is for a taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date and such Tax Proceeding could result in a material Tax Liability
of any Seller (or any direct or indirect owner of any Seller) or give rise to
a material indemnity obligation to any Seller hereunder (taking into account
the funds remaining in the Escrow Account), then the Sellers
Representative shall have the right to control the conduct of such Tax
Proceeding; _provided_ , that the Sellers Representative shall have confirmed
in writing that the Sellers Representative has elected to control such Tax
Proceeding (within twenty (20) days of being informed thereof).

(c) In the event that the Sellers Representative has elected to control a
Tax Proceeding pursuant to _Section 9.6(b)_, (i) the Sellers Representative
shall keep Purchaser informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects
of such Tax Proceeding, including providing Purchaser with all
written materials relating to such Tax Proceeding received from the relevant
Tax authority and all written materials submitted to such Taxing authority by
Sellers, (ii) Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in any such Tax
Proceeding, including having an opportunity to comment on any written
materials prepared in connection with any such Tax Proceeding and attending
any conferences relating to any such Tax Proceeding, and (iii) the Sellers
Representative shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Proceeding if such
action could result in a Tax Liability of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates without obtaining Purchasers prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(d) Purchaser shall control the conduct of any Tax Proceeding other than a Tax
Proceeding that the Sellers Representative has elected to control pursuant
to _Section 9.6(b)_; _provided_ , that in the case of any such Tax Proceeding
for a taxable period ending on or before

 



-95-  the Closing Date or for a Straddle Period, (i) Purchaser shall keep the
Sellers Representative informed regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of any such Tax Proceeding, including providing the Sellers
Representative with all written materials relating to such Tax Proceeding
received from the relevant Tax authority and all written materials submitted
to such Taxing authority by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (ii) the
Sellers Representative shall be entitled to participate in any such Tax
Proceeding, including having an opportunity to comment on any written
materials prepared in connection with any such Tax Proceeding and
attending any conferences relating to any such Tax Proceeding, and (iii)
Purchaser shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Proceeding if such
action could result in a Tax Liability of any Seller (or any direct or
indirect owner of any Seller) or give rise to a material indemnity obligation
of any Seller hereunder (taking into account the funds remaining in the Escrow
Account) without obtaining the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the procedures with respect to the conduct of
any Tax Proceeding shall be governed exclusively by this _Section 9.6_ and
the provisions of _Article XI_ shall not apply.

9.7 _Straddle Period Taxes_. In the case of any Taxes for any Straddle
Period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be (i) in the case of Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes), the
amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire relevant Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of Taxes
not described in _clause (i)_ above (such as franchise Taxes, Taxes that are
based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon occupancy or imposed
in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real
or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such Taxes shall be
determined as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, with exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on
an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) to be
allocated between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each period.

Management Blocker by an authorized officer of Management Blocker, stating
that the conditions specified in _Sections 10.2(a)_ and _10.2(b)_ , with
respect to the representations, warranties and covenants of Management
Blocker, have been satisfied; and (iii) a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by an authorized officer of the Company, stating that the conditions

representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, have been satisfied,
in each case dated as of the Closing Date.

 

(d) _Funded Indebtedness_. Purchaser shall have received a Payoff Letter.

 

(e) _Executive Employment Agreement_. The individual set forth on Section
1.1(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not have rescinded the
Executive Employment Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the condition
set forth in this _Section 10.2(e)_ shall be deemed satisfied if Purchaser or
its Affiliates take any action that would constitute a breach of the
Executive Employment Agreement or "good reason" under the Executive Employment
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, such individuals death or disability
shall not constitute a rescission.

 

(f) _Client Consents_. Non-Consenting Client AUM as of the date the Closing is
to occur in accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_ shall not exceed the Non-
Consenting Client Adjustment Ceiling.

10.3 _Conditions to Blocker Entities  and the Companys Obligation to
Close_. The obligations of each of KC Blocker, Management Blocker and the
Company to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of all
of the following conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the
date hereof and as of the Closing Date (or, if made as of a specific date, as
of such date) as if made on and as of the Closing Date except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct as of
the Closing date (or, if made as of a specific date, as of such date) (without
giving regard to any materiality or qualifications set forth therein) would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Covenants and Agreements_. The covenants and agreements of Purchaser to
be performed on or before the Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement
shall have been performed in all material respects.

(c) _Officer s Certificate_. KC Blocker, Management Blocker and the Company

behalf of Purchaser by an executive officer of Purchaser, stating that the
conditions specified in  _Sections 10.3(a)_ and _10.3(b)_ have been
satisfied.

 



-98- (d) _Tax Opinion_. KC Blocker shall have received the opinion of its counsel,
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, or, if Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz is
unable to provide such opinion, the opinion of Purchasers counsel, Pillsbury
Winthrop Shaw Pittman, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially to the
effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth
in such opinion that are consistent with the state of facts existing as of the
First Effective Time, the First Merger and the Second Merger, taken together,
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may require and rely upon
customary representations contained in certificates of officers of Purchaser,
Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 1A, KC Blocker and the Company.

10.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither Sellers nor Purchaser may
rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 10.1_, _10.2_ or
_10.3,_ as the case may be, if such failure was caused by such Partys failure
to comply with any provision of this Agreement.

respect to the calculation of the amount of any Losses attributable to a

set forth in this Agreement or in exhibits, annexes or schedules hereto, or in
any certificates or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Blocker
Entities or the Company pursuant to this Agreement.

Purchaser, Merger Subs or any of their respective Representatives

 



-101-  at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of
or compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The
waiver of any condition based upon the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or

11.3 _Seller Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_.

(a) In the event that any claim or demand, or other circumstance or statement
of facts which could give rise to any claim or demand, for which the Sellers
may be liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted or sought to be collected
by a third party (" _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall as soon as
practicable notify the Sellers Representative, the KC Blocker Sellers (or
another designee of the KC Blocker Sellers identified in writing to Purchaser
by the Sellers Representative) and the Management Blocker Sellers (or another
designee of the Management Blocker Sellers identified in writing to Purchaser
by the Sellers Representative) in writing of such Third Party Claim ("
_Notice of Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide the
Notice of Claim shall not release any Seller from any of its, his or her
obligations under this _Article XI_ except to the extent that such Seller has
been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. The Notice of Claim
shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has paid, suffered, reserved or properly
accrued Losses or reasonably anticipates that it will incur Liability for
Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement, (ii) state the amount of such Losses to the extent known, and
(iii) specify in reasonable detail the material facts known to the Indemnitee
giving rise to such claim and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related and
the computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled
hereunder. The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Notice of Claim a copy of all
relevant papers served with respect to such Third Party Claim, if any, and
any other documents evidencing such Third Party Claim.

(b) Except as otherwise provided below, the Sellers Representative, in the
case of a claim under _Section 11.2(a)_, the Sellers Representative or KC
Blocker Sellers (or another designee of the KC Blocker Sellers identified in
writing to Purchaser by the Sellers Representative) on behalf of the KC
Blocker Sellers in the case of a claim under _Section 11.2(b)_, the Sellers
Representative or Management Blocker Sellers (or another designee of the
Management Blocker Sellers identified in writing to Purchaser by the Sellers
Representative) on behalf of the Management Blocker Sellers in the case of a
claim under _Section 11.2(c)_, shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense through counsel of
its choice (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) if the
Sellers Representative, KC Blocker Sellers or Management Blocker Sellers, as
applicable, gives notice of such intention to Purchaser within twenty (20)
days of the receipt of the Notice of Claims and in such notice acknowledges
in writing the obligation of the Sellers to indemnify and hold harmless the
Indemnitees against any Losses, subject to the limitations herein, that may
result from such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Sellers Representative, KC Blocker Sellers or Management Blocker Sellers, as
applicable, shall not have the right to assume

 



-102-  the defense of the Third Party Claim (but in no event shall be liable for
the fees and expenses of more than one firm of counsel for all Purchaser
Indemnitees and one other firm of local counsel) to the extent (i) the
Purchaser shall have been advised in writing by counsel that the assumption of
such defense by the party assuming the defense of such matter would be
inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest, (ii) the
named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include
both a Purchaser Indemnitee and the party seeking to assume the defense of
such matter and such Purchaser Indemnitee shall have been advised in writing
by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the
Purchaser Indemnitee which are not available to the party seeking to assume
the defense of such matter, (iii) any such claim seeks, in addition to or in
lieu of monetary losses, any injunctive or other equitable relief, (iv) the
Escrow Account, in the reasonable judgement of Purchaser, is not adequate to
cover all Losses related to such claim, (v) any such claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal action, indictment, allegation or
Action, (vi) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third
Party Claim may establish (in the judgment of Purchaser) a precedential custom
or practice adverse to the business interests or reputation of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or (vii) any claim involves violations of the Advisors
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers Representative shall, at its
own cost and expense and without recourse to the Escrow Account, have the
right to participate in and be reasonably informed of the defense of such
Third Party Claim, but Purchaser shall control all aspects of such defense,
including the investigation, defense and, subject to this  _Section 11.3_
settlement thereof).

(c) If the Sellers Representative assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim
as provided above, they will conduct the defense actively, diligently and at
its own expense, and, subject to the limitations contained in this _Article
XI_, the Sellers will indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnitees harmless
from and against all Losses caused by or arising out of such Third Party
Claim. The Purchaser Indemnitees shall reasonably cooperate with the party
assuming the defense of such matter and make available to the such party (at
such partys expense) all pertinent records, materials and information in the
Purchaser Indemnitees possession or under the Purchaser Indemnitees control
relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the party assuming the defense
of such matter. Except with the written consent of the Purchaser, the party
assuming the defense of a matter will not, in the defense of a Third Party
Claim, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement (i)
which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving to the
Purchaser Indemnitee and all of its Affiliates by the third party of a release
from all liability with respect to such suit, claim, action, or proceeding;
(ii) unless there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law by the
Purchaser Indemnitee (or any Affiliate thereof); and (iii) which exceeds the
then current value of the Escrow Account. The Sellers Representative shall be
required to provide Purchaser a copy of any proposed judgment or proposed
settlement at least ten (10) Business Days before the Sellers Representative
consents or enters into any such judgment or settlement.

 

(d) In the event that the Sellers Representative fails or elects not to
assume the defense of a Purchaser Indemnitee against such Third Party Claim
which the Sellers Representative had the right to assume under this _Section
11.3_ (or after assuming such defense, fails to actively and diligently
conduct the defense thereof) or if the Sellers Representative is not
entitled to assume such defense under this _Section 11.3_, the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall have the right, at the expense of the Sellers, to defend or
prosecute such claim (and in such event shall do 

 



-103-  so actively and diligently) and may settle such claim or consent to entry of
judgment; _provided_ , _however_ , that it may not settle such claim or
consent to entry of judgment without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representatives in the case of a claim under _Section 11.2(a)_, the
Sellers Representative or KC Blocker Sellers (or another designee of the KC
Blocker Sellers identified in writing to Purchaser by the Sellers
Representative) on behalf of the KC Blocker Sellers in the case of a claim
under _Section 11.2(b)_, or the Sellers Representative or Management Blocker
Sellers (or another designee of the Management Blocker Sellers identified in
writing to Purchaser by the Sellers Representative) on behalf of the
Management Blocker Sellers in the case of a claim under _Section 11.2(c)_
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), if (i) the
Purchaser Indemnitee does not irrevocably waive all claims to indemnification
under this Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim, (ii) any amount
is required to be paid from the Escrow Account in respect of such Third Party
Claim, (iii) the settlement does not expressly unconditionally release the
applicable Seller and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with
respect to such Third Party Claim or (iv) the settlement imposes injunctive
or other equitable relief against, or any other adverse effect on, such Seller
or its Affiliates provided, however, that if Purchaser Indemnitee settles any
such Third Party Claim or consents to entry of judgment without such consent
of the Sellers Representatives, the settlement of such claim or consent to
entry of judgment shall not, nor shall the entry of any judgment in and of
itself, prevent the Sellers Representatives from contesting the issue of
whether such claim is within the scope of and subject to indemnification
under this Article IX. The Sellers Representative shall cooperate with the
Purchaser Indemnitees in such defense and make available to the Purchaser
Indemnitees, at their expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and
information in their possession or under their control relating thereto as is
reasonably requested by the Purchaser Indemnitee.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing provisions
of this _Section 11.3_ shall not apply with respect to the conduct of any
Tax Proceeding, which shall be governed exclusively by _Section 9.6_.

11.4 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Purchaser
Indemnitee will notify the Sellers Representative, the KC Blocker Sellers (or
another designee of the KC Blocker Sellers identified in writing to Purchaser
by the Sellers Representative) and the Management Blocker Sellers (or
another designee of the Management Blocker Sellers identified in writing to
Purchaser by the Sellers Representative) in writing promptly of its discovery
of any matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim, such notice to
contain the information set forth in the following sentence; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide the Notice of Claim shall not release
any Seller from any of its, his or her obligations under this  _Article XI_
except to the extent that it has been actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure. The Notice of Claim shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has
paid, suffered, reserved or properly accrued Losses or reasonably anticipates
that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) state the amount of such
Losses to the extent known, and (iii) specify in reasonable detail
the material facts known to the Indemnitee giving rise to such claim and the
nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or
claim to which each such item is related and the computation of the amount to
which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled hereunder. The Sellers
Representative on behalf of the Sellers in the case of a claim under _Section
11.2(a)_, the Sellers

 



-104-  Representative or KC Blocker Sellers (or another designee of the KC Blocker
Sellers identified in writing to Purchaser by the Sellers Representative) on
behalf of the KC Blocker Sellers in the case of a claim under _Section
11.2(b)_, the Sellers Representative or Management Blocker Sellers (or
another designee of the Management Blocker Sellers identified in writing to
Purchaser by the Sellers Representative) on behalf of the Management Blocker
Sellers in the case of a claim under _Section 11.2(c)_, shall have twenty
(20) days after receipt of any notice for a claim by an Indemnitee to dispute
such claim. The Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate and assist the Sellers
Representative, KC Blocker Sellers and Management Blocker Sellers (or their
respective designees) in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity
by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance
and cooperation will include providing reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing
employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of
such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters. If the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, in the case
of a claim under _Section 11.2(a)_, the Sellers Representative or KC
Blocker Sellers (or another designee of the KC Blocker Sellers identified in
writing to Purchaser by the Sellers Representative) on behalf of the KC
Blocker Sellers in the case of a claim under _Section 11.2(b)_, the
Sellers Representative or Management Blocker Sellers (or another designee of
the Management Blocker Sellers identified in writing to Purchaser by the
Sellers Representative) on behalf of the Management Blocker Sellers in the
case of a claim under  _Section 11.2(c) _fails to dispute such claim within
the twenty day period specified above, or upon a final resolution of any
dispute in favor of an Indemnitee (a " _Resolved Claim_ "), such claim
specified by the Indemnitee shall be conclusively deemed Losses subject to
indemnification under this _Article XI_.

11.5 _Limitations_.

 

(a) Other than in the case of intentional common law fraud or with respect to
Fundamental Representations or Tax Representations, no Purchaser Indemnitee
be entitled to assert a claim for indemnification under _Sections 11.2(a)(i)_
, _11.2(b)(i)_ or _11.2(c)(i)_ with respect to an individual item of Losses
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses suffered by the Purchaser
Indemnitees arising from the same set of facts and circumstances exceeds
$50,000 (and such claims shall not be aggregated for purposes of _Section
11.5(b)_).

 

(b) Other than in the case of intentional common law fraud or with respect to
Fundamental Representations or Tax Representations, the Sellers shall not be
required to provide indemnification under _Sections 11.2(a)(i)_ , _11.2(b)(i)_
or _11.2(c)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of the Losses subject to
indemnification under this _Article XI_ exceeds $2,000,000 in the aggregate,
and then only to the extent that such Losses exceed such aggregate amount.

(c) From and after the Closing, other than in the case of intentional common
law fraud, the liability of the Sellers for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to
this _Article XI_ shall not exceed an amount equal to the Escrow Amount (plus
any interest thereon included in the Escrow Account). Other than in the case
of intentional common law fraud, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, the amount of any Losses payable to the Purchaser Indemnitees under
this _Article XI_ shall be made solely from funds available in the Escrow
Account.

 



-105- (d) In calculating amounts payable to Purchaser Indemnitees hereunder, the
amount of any indemnified Losses will be computed net of payments actually
recovered by the Indemnitee under indemnification agreements or arrangements,
warranties, subrogation actions and similar rights with third parties or under
any insurance policy with respect to such Losses, in each case less (i) the
cost and expense of pursuing such proceeds or any Taxes imposed in respect of
such proceeds, (ii) the deductible associated with any insurance recovery and
(iii) the amount of all retro-premium obligations and premium increases
resulting from such recovery that are reasonably anticipated to be incurred in
the subsequent twelve months. Each Purchaser Indemnitee shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage
or from third parties for any Losses payable under this _Article XI_,
_provided_ that such efforts will not limit the timing or amount of Losses
payable hereunder. If the Purchaser Indemnitee receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment from the
Escrow Account, then such Purchaser Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the
Sellers Representative for any payment made from the Escrow Account in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Purchaser Indemnitee, net of any expenses incurred by such
Purchaser Indemnitee in collecting such amount.

(e) Upon deposit of the Escrow Stock Amount and Escrow Cash Amount into the
Escrow Account at the Closing, that portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the
Pro Rata Percentage of each Seller shall be deemed allocated to such Seller
(with respect to each Seller, such Sellers " _Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Account_ "). The aggregate amount to which all Purchaser Indemnitees may be
entitled to indemnification under this _Article XI _with respect to the
aggregate liability of any Seller under this _Article XI_ will be limited to
such Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Account. For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Pro Rata Percentage_ " of any Seller means, with respect to
claims made under this _Article XI_, the fraction (x) the numerator of which
is the amount of the First Merger Consideration, Company Merger Consideration
and/or Incentive Unit Consideration actually distributed to such Seller and
(y) the denominator of which is the sum of the value of the First Merger
Consideration, Company Merger Consideration and Incentive Unit Consideration,
in the case of both clauses (x) and (y) calculated with reference to the
Average Purchaser Closing Price.

 

(f) The Sellers shall not have any liability pursuant to this _Article XI_
for Losses that have been accounted for in the post-Closing adjustments
contemplated by _Section 2.10_.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) limit any Indemnitees
right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any such Indemnitee may
be entitled or (ii) limit any Indemnitees remedies with respect to matters
relating to agreements other than this Agreement.

 

(h) No Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Article XI_ for, and in no event shall Losses be deemed to include (i) any
punitive damages (except to the extent included in any Third Party Claim) or
(ii) any Taxes (other than any interests, penalties or additions to tax,
notwithstanding the definition of "Taxes") imposed in 

 



-106-  respect of a Post-Closing Period or any related Losses (for the avoidance of
doubt, this clause (ii) shall not be interpreted to limit a Purchaser
Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification pursuant to this _Article XI_ in
respect of any Losses relating to Taxes imposed in respect of a Pre-Closing
Tax Period).

 

11.6 _Escrow Account_.

 

(a) By virtue of this Agreement and as security for the indemnity obligations
of the Sellers provided for in this _Article XI_, at the Closing in
accordance with _Section 2.9(b)(ix)_ _(I)_ and _(J)_ , Purchaser shall
deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Stock Amount and the Escrow Cash
Amount. The Escrow Account shall be available to pay and to compensate
Purchaser Indemnitees for the indemnification obligations of the Sellers
hereunder.

(b) Upon written notice not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Sellers Representative may (at the direction and on behalf
of any Seller that is an Accredited Investor) elect to substitute, solely with
respect to that portion of the Escrow Stock Amount equal to the Pro Rata
Percentage of each Seller that is an Accredited Investor, cash for such number
of shares of Purchaser Common Stock. Such written notice shall describe the
election, including the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock (the "
_Substituted Shares_ ") to be distributed to such Seller in exchange for cash
in an amount equal to the Substituted Shares _multiplied by_ the Average
Purchaser Closing Price (the " _Substituted Cash Amount_ "). Upon the deposit
by such Seller at the Closing of an aggregate amount in cash equal to the
Substituted Cash Amount with the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer to the Escrow
Account in immediately available funds, free of any costs, fees, set-off,
deductions and withholding, Purchaser shall disburse the Substituted Shares
to such Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, if such Seller fails to deposit
the Substituted Cash Amount with the Escrow Agent at the Closing in accordance
with the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall not disburse the Substituted
Shares to such Seller but shall instead deposit the Substituted Shares with
the Escrow Agent as provided in _Section 2.9(b)(ix)(J)_.

 

(c) The Escrow Account shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(d) The Escrow Account shall be in existence on the Closing Date and shall
terminate at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the date that is fourteen (14)
months following the Closing Date (the period of time from the Closing Date
through and including such termination date is referred to herein as the "
_Escrow Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Period shall not
terminate with respect to any amount (the " _Remaining Escrow Accounts_ ")
that is subject to any claim that is pending against Escrow Account as of such
date and time and, solely with respect to all such claims, the Escrow Period
shall be extended until such date and time as all such claims are resolved or
finally determined in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



-107- (e) No later than the second Business Day following the expiration of the
Escrow Period (the " _Release Date_ "), Purchaser and Sellers Representative
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent Joint Release Instructions instructing, the
Escrow Agent to disburse to each former holder of shares or units, as
applicable, of Convertible Interests and Incentive Units in accordance with
this Section 11.6(e) all amounts of cash and stock remaining in the Escrow
Account on the Release Date less an amount equal to the aggregate amount
requested in any Outstanding Claims as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Final
Release Date. The Escrow Agent shall retain and continue to hold in the Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms hereof an amount equal to the aggregate
amount requested in all such Outstanding Claims (the " _Retained Amount_ ")
until fully resolved; _provided_ , that within two (2) Business Days of the
resolution of any Outstanding Claim in full pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, Purchaser and Sellers Representative shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent Joint Release Instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to each
former holder of shares or units, as applicable, of Convertible Interests and
Incentive Units all or such portion of the Retained Amount that was withheld
due to such resolved Outstanding Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, any
amounts paid to the former holders of shares or units, as applicable, of
Convertible Interests and Incentive Units pursuant to this  _Section 11.(e)_
will be payable pro rata in accordance with the number of Membership Units
beneficially owned by such holders immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, or such other proportion as is required to cause such payment to be
distributed in accordance with Section 7.1 of the LLC Agreement; _provided_ ,
that in no event shall any shares of Purchaser Common Stock be delivered from
the Escrow Amount to former holders of Incentive Units or Non-
accredited Investors; _provided_ , _further_ , that after payment in cash has
been made or set aside for holders of Incentive Units, each holder of
Convertible Interests shall be entitled to receive, for each Convertible
Interest so held, a portion of the remaining amount of cash and Purchaser
Common Stock allocated ratably among cash and Purchaser Common Stock in
accordance with the ratio of cash to the aggregate value of the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock so payable, valuing each share of Purchaser Common
Stock based the Average Purchaser Closing Price.

11.7 _Payments_. After a claim has become a Resolved Claim or after the
obligation has been determined in a final judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Sellers Representative shall, within two (2) Business Days,
instruct the Escrow Agent to make payment by wire transfer to a bank account
designated in writing by the Indemnitee (such designation to be made at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the date such payment is due) in immediately
available funds.

 

11.8 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law (including a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state,
local or non-U.S. Law), any payment made pursuant to this _Article XI_ or
_Article IX_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
purchase price.

11.9 _Exclusivity_. Except as provided in _Article IX_,  _Article XI_ and
_Section 13.9_, and other than in the case of intentional common law fraud,
from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive liability and
responsibility of the Sellers in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (including for any breach of or
inaccuracy in any

 



-108-  representation or warranty or for any breach of any covenant or obligation
), and the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser with respect to any of the
foregoing shall be as set forth in this  _Article XI_.

ARTICLE XII

 

TERMINATION

12.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Purchaser;

(b) by either the Company or Purchaser, if:

 

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the date that is six (6)
months after the date hereof (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 12.1(b)(i)_
shall not be available to any Party to this Agreement whose failure or whose
Affiliates failure to perform any material covenant or obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of or has resulted in the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on or before such date;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may extend the Outside Date for
up to three (3) additional months if (x) all conditions to closing set forth
in _Article X_ are satisfied other than the condition set forth in _Section
10.1(a)_ and (y) the Parties are still actively seeking in good faith
approval under the HSR Act;

(ii) if any Order issued, or Law enacted, entered or promulgated, by a
Governmental Entity permanently restrains, enjoins or prohibits or makes
illegal the consummation of the Mergers in a manner that would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in  _Section 10.1(a)_ or _10.1(b)_ ,
and such Order becomes effective, final and nonappealable (except for Orders
relating to Antitrust Laws, which shall be governed by _Section
12.1(b)(iii)_); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 12.1(b)(ii)_ shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to oppose such Order or Law to the extent required by
_Section 7.2_; or

 

(iii) if any Governmental Entity that must grant a permit, authorization,
consent, approval, expiration or termination required by _Section 10.1(a)_
shall have denied such grant in a manner that would give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 10.1(a)_ and such denial shall have
become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 12.1(b)(iii)_
shall have used its reasonable best efforts to obtain such permit,
authorization, consent, approval, expiration or termination to the extent
required by _Section 7.2_.

(c) by the Company if Purchaser or the Merger Subs shall have breached any of
their representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or any such
representations or

 



-109-  warranties fail to be true and correct or Purchaser or the Merger Subs shall
have breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, and such breaches or failures (A) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 10.3(a)_ or
_10.3(b)_ and (B) (x) cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date or (y) have
not been cured prior to the date that is 30 days from the date that the
Company notifies Purchaser of any such breach or failure;

(d) by Purchaser if KC Blocker, Management Blocker or the Company shall have
breached any of their respective representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement or any such respective representations or warranties fail to be
true and correct or KC Blocker, Management Blocker or the Company shall have
breached or failed to perform any of their respective covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breaches or failures (A)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in  _Section
10.2(a)_ or _10.2(b)_ and (B) (x) cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date or
(y) have not been cured prior to the date that is 30 days from the date that
Purchaser notifies KC Blocker, Management Blocker and the Company of any such
breach or failure;

(e) by Purchaser if, on or before 5:00 p.m. New York City local time on the
date hereof KC Blocker has not delivered to Purchaser a copy of resolutions
effecting the KC Blocker Stockholder Consent.

(f) by the Company if Closing has not occurred by the date upon which the
Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_.

12.2 _Notice of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
by the Company pursuant to _Section 12.1_, written notice of such termination
shall be given by the Company to Purchaser. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by Purchaser or any of the Merger Subs pursuant to _Section
12.1_, written notice of such termination shall be given by such Party to each
of KC Blocker, Management Blocker and the Company.

 

12.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 12.1_, this Agreement shall terminate and become void
and have no effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of any Party
to this Agreement, except that _Section 7.5_ (Public Announcements), _Section
7.6_ (Litigation Support), the expense reimbursement and indemnification
provisions of _Section 7.10_ (Financing), _Section 12.4_ (Expenses) and
_Article XIII_ (General Provisions) shall survive any termination of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _ however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall
relieve any Party hereto from liability for (a) any intentional common law
fraud or (b) the taking of any action or the failure to take any action with
the knowledge or reckless disregard that such act or failure to act would be
a material breach of this Agreement.

12.4 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, including
_Article II_ and _Sections 7.2_ and _7.10_ , whether or not the Closing takes
place, all legal and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with this

contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the

 



-110-  contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay, when due, and be
responsible for, the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent relating to the

-111- 13.2 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial; No
Recourse_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed and to be
performed wholly within such State and without reference to the choice or
conflict of law principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would result in the application of the Laws of a different
jurisdiction. 

(b) Each Party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or solely if such courts decline
jurisdiction in any federal court located in the State of Delaware) any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably agrees
that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined in such
court. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way
of motion, defense, counterclaim, or otherwise, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Action. The Parties further agree, (i) to the
extent permitted by Law, that final and nonappealable judgment against any of
them in any Action contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the
judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact
and amount of such judgment and (ii) that service of process upon such Party
in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with _Section 13.5_.

 

(c) Each Party to this Agreement knowingly, intentionally, and voluntarily
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law trial by jury in any
action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by any of them against the other
arising out of or in any way connected with this Agreement, or any other
agreements executed in connection herewith or the administration thereof or
any of the transactions contemplated herein or therein. No Party to this
Agreement shall seek a jury trial in any lawsuit, proceeding, counterclaim or
any other litigation procedure based upon, or arising out of, this Agreement
or any related instruments or the relationship between the Parties. No Party
will seek to consolidate any such action in which a jury trial has been waived
with any other action in which a jury trial cannot be or has not been waived.
Each Party to this Agreement certifies that it has been induced to enter into
this agreement or instrument by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications set forth above in this _Section 13.2_. No Party has in any
way agreed with or represented to any other Party that the provisions of this
_Section 13.2_ will not be fully enforced in all instances.

13.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto,
constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any prior
discussion, correspondence, negotiation, proposed term sheet, agreement,
understanding or arrangement and there are no agreements, understandings,
representations or warranties between the Parties other than those set
forth or referred to in this

 



-112-  Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. None of the Parties shall be liable or
bound to any other Party in any manner by any representations, warranties or
covenants relating to such subject matter except as specifically set forth in
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or in the Exhibits and Schedules
thereto.

13.4 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Sections 7.7_ ,
_7.8_ and _7.10_ , and this _Section 13.4_, and if the First Merger Effective
Time, Second Merger Effective Time and Company Merger Effective Time
occur, the Persons benefiting from Article II pursuant thereto, this
Agreement is not intended to give any Person (other than the Parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns) any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any covenants,
conditions or provisions contained herein, as a third party beneficiary or
otherwise.

13.6 _Successors and Assigns_. No Party to this Agreement may directly or
indirectly assign any or all of its rights or delegate any or all of its
obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of
each other Party to this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of
this _Section 13.6_ shall be void.

 

13.7 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Purchaser and
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , than any modification or amendment that
is disproportionately adverse to KC Blocker or Management Blocker shall also
require the prior written consent of KC Blocker or Management Blocker,
respectively. Purchaser and the Merger Subs, on the one hand, or KC Blocker,
Management Blocker and the Company, on the other hand, may, only by an
instrument in writing, waive compliance by KC Blocker, Management Blocker and
the Company or Purchaser and the Merger Subs, respectively, with any term or
provision of this Agreement to be performed or complied with. The waiver by
any Party to this Agreement of a breach of any term or provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

 



-115-  At any time prior to the Closing, either Purchaser and the Merger Subs, on
the one hand, or KC Blocker, Management Blocker and the Company, on the other
hand, may (a) extend the time for performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of KC Blocker, Management Blocker and the Company or Purchaser and
the Merger Subs, respectively, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the Parties granting such extension or waiver.

13.8 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement (or portions thereof) shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party hereto. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof)
shall be held to be so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. Upon a determination that
any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is invalid,
void or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

13.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches by the
Parties of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled in law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction. The foregoing is in addition to any other remedy to which
any party is entitled at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties further
agree that nothing set forth in this _Section 13.9_ shall require any party
hereto to institute any Action for (or limit any partys right to institute
any Action for) specific performance under this _Section 13.9_ prior to or
as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article XII_ (and
pursuing damages after such termination). If any Party brings any action to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by
any other Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the
amount of time during which such action is pending, plus 20 Business Days or
(y) such

 



-116-  other time period established by the court presiding over such action. In
the event that a court of competent jurisdiction fails to grant specific
performance or other injunctive relief to any of KC Blocker, Management
Blocker or the Company as a remedy for any failure to perform or breach
hereunder, or in any circumstance in which damages are recoverable by any of
KC Blocker, Management Blocker or the Company hereunder, the Parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that KC Blocker, Management Blocker or the
Company, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive benefit of the bargain
and lost profits damages as redress for such failure to perform or breach.

 

13.10 _No Admission_. Nothing herein (including in the KC Blocker Disclosure
Schedule, the Management Blocker Disclosure Schedule, the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule) shall be deemed an admission by
Sellers, KC Blocker, Management Blocker or the Company any of their respective
Affiliates, in any Action or proceeding involving a third party, that such
third party is or is not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the
performance or observance of any term or provision of any contract.

 

13.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by any of the Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by electronic mail in
portable document format (.pdf) or by facsimile shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

13.12  _Sellers  Representative_.

(a) Each Letter of Transmittal shall provide that the Sellers Representative
shall be the agent and attorney-in-fact for each Seller with full powers and
authority (including full power of substitution) to act on behalf of such
Sellers regarding any matter relating to or under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, including for the purposes of (i) paying or accepting any
funds due to or from Purchaser, the Merger Subs, the Surviving Merger Sub, the
Surviving Company, Sellers or the Escrow Agent; (ii) making all determinations
and taking all actions in connection with any action or payments contemplated
by _Sections 2.10_ and _2.11_ and _Article XI_; (iii) executing and
delivering all agreements (including the Escrow Agreement), certificates,
receipts, consents, elections, instructions and other documents (including
any amendments thereto or waivers thereof) required or contemplated by, or
deemed necessary or advisable by the Sellers Representative in its sole
discretion in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (iv) taking all other things
and to performing all other acts required or contemplated by, or deemed
necessary or advisable by the Sellers Representative in its sole discretion
in connection with, this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. As the representative of Sellers under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Sellers Representative shall act as
the agent for Sellers, shall have authority to bind Sellers in accordance
with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and Purchaser, the Merger Subs
and the Escrow Agent may rely on such appointment and authority until the
receipt of notice of the appointment of a successor upon two (2) Business
Days prior written notice to Purchaser or the Escrow Agent. Purchaser and the
Escrow Agent may conclusively rely upon, without independent verification or
investigation, all decisions made by the Sellers Representative in

 



-117-  connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as applicable, in
writing and signed by an officer of the general partner of the Sellers
Representative. Each Letter of Transmittal shall provide that all of the
immunities and powers granted to the Sellers Representative thereby shall
survive the Closing Date and/or any termination of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) The Sellers Representative shall have no liability to Purchaser or the
Escrow Agent for any default under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as
applicable, by any of KC Blocker, Management Blocker or the Company. Except
for intentional common law fraud or willful misconduct on its part, the
Sellers Representative shall have no liability to any of KC
Blocker, Management Blocker, the Company or any Seller under this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement for any action or omission by the Sellers
Representative on behalf of Sellers.

 

(c) At the Closing, the Sellers Representative Expense Amount shall be paid
to an account specified by the Sellers Representative (the " _Sellers 
Representative Expense Fund_") to enable the Sellers Representative to
satisfy its obligations hereunder and out of which the Sellers Representative
may cause to be paid, or reimburse itself for the payment of, the Sellers
Representative Expenses incurred by the Sellers Representative in the
performance or discharge of its duties. The Sellers Representative shall have
sole and exclusive authority to disburse and pay amounts placed into the
Sellers Representative Expense Fund. Each Letter of Transmittal shall provide
that, from time to time after the Closing Date, in the event that the Sellers
Representative determines that any then-remaining balance of the Sellers
Representative Expense Fund is not sufficient to pay actual or anticipated
Sellers Representative Expenses incurred by the Sellers Representative in
the performance or discharge of its duties, each Seller shall be obligated,
within ten (10) days after delivery of written notice from the Sellers
Representative, to contribute to the Sellers Representative Expense Fund such
Sellers pro rata portion (based on the consideration payable in the Mergers)
of the aggregate additional amount to be deposited in the Sellers
Representative Expense Fund as the Sellers Representative determines is
necessary and which amount shall be set forth in such written notice and, in
addition, that the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to withhold
funds from any payment to the Sellers hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement
in the event that the Sellers Representative determines that any then-
remaining balance of the Sellers Representative Expense Fund may not be
sufficient to pay actual or anticipated Sellers Representative Expenses
incurred by the Sellers Representative in the performance or discharge of its
duties.

 

13.13 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_ _._ It is acknowledged by
each of the Parties hereto that KC Blocker and the Company have retained
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz (" _Sellers  Counsel_") to act as their
counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that
Sellers Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that none of the
other parties hereto has the status of a client of Sellers Counsel for
conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof.
Purchaser, the Merger Subs and the Transferred Entities and their respective
Affiliates hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective
directors, equityholders, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing in
connection with matters

 



-118-  related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby between
Purchaser, or any other matter regarding which Sellers Counsel has acted as
counsel for KC Blocker or its owners (or their Affiliates other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries), the Surviving Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company and/or its Affiliates on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
Sellers Counsel may represent Sellers in such dispute even though the
interests of Sellers may be directly adverse to Purchaser, the Surviving
Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or its Affiliates, and even though Sellers
Counsel may have represented KC Blocker, the Company or its Affiliates in a
matter substantially related to such dispute. Purchaser further agrees that,
as to all confidential communications among Sellers Counsel, Sellers, KC
Blocker, Management Blocker, the Company and/or its Affiliates that relate
to the negotiation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other matter regarding which Sellers Counsel has acted as
counsel for KC Blocker or its owners (or their Affiliates other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiairies) (" _Confidential Attorney-Client
Transaction Communications_ "), the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belong to Sellers and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Purchaser, the Surviving Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or any
of their Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, the Surviving
Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates and a third
party (other than Sellers, a Party to this Agreement or any of their
respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Company and its Affiliates may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of Confidential
Attorney-Client Transaction Communications by Sellers Counsel to such third
party or the use thereof by Sellers Counsel in connection with its
representation of a party in such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Purchaser, the Surviving Merger Sub, the Surviving Company nor its
Affiliates may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Sellerss Representative. This _Section 13.13 _shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Seller without the
express written consent of the Sellers Representative (it being expressly
agreed this _Section 13.13_ is intended for the benefit of the Sellers and
the Sellers Representative and may be enforced directly by the Sellers
Representative, for itself or on behalf of any of the Sellers).
