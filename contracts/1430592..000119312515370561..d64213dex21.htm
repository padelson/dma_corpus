related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby between Purchaser, or any other matter regarding which Sellers&#146; Counsel has acted as counsel for KC Blocker or its owners
(or their Affiliates other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), the Surviving Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and/or its Affiliates on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, Sellers&#146; Counsel may represent Sellers in such
dispute even though the interests of Sellers may be directly adverse to Purchaser, the Surviving Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or its Affiliates, and even though Sellers&#146; Counsel may have represented KC Blocker, the Company or its
