The Merger. 

3.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
Article 8, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation"). Such merger shall be governed by Section 251 of the DGCL.

3.2 Effective Time; Closing. Upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the closing of the Merger (the "Merger Closing") will take place (a) at the
offices of Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian, LLP, at
3570 Carmel Mountain Road, Suite 200, San Diego, California, as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in no event later than the third (3rd) business
day) after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article 8 (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions)
or (b) at such other time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and
the Company. The date on which the Merger Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Merger Closing Date." Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable
requirements of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly executed
by the Company and simultaneously with the Merger Closing shall be filed with
the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger
shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the date and time of such filing, or such later time as shall be agreed by
Parent and the Company and specified in such filing, being the "Effective
Time"). 

3.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

3.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law (subject to Section 7.7).

(b) The Bylaws of the Company shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until duly amended as provided therein or in the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable Law (subject to
Section 7.7).

3.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and, except as
determined by Parent or Purchaser prior to the Effective Time, the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

3.6 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holders of
any of the following securities:

(a) Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 3.6(b) and any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and shall
be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Per Share Amount (the "Merger Consideration")
payable to the holder of such Company Share, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 3.9. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent
appropriate for all purposes of this Article 3.

(b) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Company
Share owned by Purchaser, Parent, Murata or any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, Murata or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof,
and no payment or distribution shall be made and no consideration of any kind
shall be delivered with respect thereto. 

(c) Each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

3.7 Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; ESPP.

(a) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company Stock Options, each
outstanding Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is not an
Out-of-the-Money Option shall be cancelled at the Effective Time (such vested
and unvested Company Stock Options, the "ITM Options") and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Amount over the applicable exercise price of such ITM
Option by (y) the number of Company Shares subject to such ITM Option, less
all applicable deductions and withholdings required by law to be withheld in
respect of such payment. Payments in respect of ITM Options to employees and
former employees of the Company shall be remitted through the payroll system
of the Company. Payments in respect of ITM Options to non-employees shall be
remitted through the Company's accounts payable or (with the consent of the
Paying Agent) through the Paying Agent.

(b) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company Stock Options, each Company
Stock Option outstanding at the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested)
that has an exercise price per share equal to or greater than the Per Share
Amount (an "Out-of-the-Money Option") shall be cancelled at the Effective Time
for no consideration.

(c) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or holders of Company RSUs, each Company RSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the
Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive, an amount
in cash equal to (x) the Per Share Amount multiplied by (y) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU, less all
applicable deductions and withholdings required by Law to be withheld in
respect of such payment (the "RSU Consideration"). The right to receive the
RSU Consideration, or applicable portion thereof, by the holder of such right
shall vest and become payable in accordance with the original vesting schedule
of the corresponding Company RSU(s) to which the right relates so long as such
holder remains in continuous employment or service with the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or an affiliate of Parent through each
applicable vesting date in accordance with the original vesting schedule
applicable to each such Company RSU under the applicable equity plan award
agreement and any other applicable Contract that is in effect on the date
hereof; provided, that, in addition to any rights to accelerated vesting the
holder of such a right would be entitled to receive pursuant to the existing
terms of such award agreement or such Contract at any time following the date
hereof, in the event the employment or other service of the holder of such a
right is terminated during the one-year period commencing on the Effective
Time either (i) by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or an
affiliate of Parent, as the case may be, without Cause, or (ii) if applicable,
by such holder's resignation for Good Reason, the vesting of the right to
receive the RSU Consideration held by such holder shall be fully accelerated
at the time of such termination. In all 

events, the RSU Consideration, or applicable portion thereof, shall be paid
within 15 days following the date(s) on which it has become vested. From and
after the Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding Company RSUs, and the
former holders thereof shall be entitled only to the payment of the RSU
Consideration. Payments of the RSU Consideration for cancelled Company RSUs to
employees of the Company shall be remitted through the payroll system of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or affiliate of Parent, as the case
may be.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall to the extent and in the
manner required by the applicable Company Stock Plan provide notice (in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of an outstanding award
granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan describing the treatment of such
award in accordance with this Section 3.7. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take (or cause there to be taken, as the case may be) such
actions, shall obtain such consents, adopt (or cause there to be adopted) any
amendments of any Company Stock Plan and any awards thereunder, as may be
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.7. In
addition, the Company shall not commence any purchase periods under the ESPP
following the date of this Agreement, and prior to the Effective Time, shall
adopt (or cause there to be adopted) resolutions of the Board terminating the
ESPP.

3.8 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by the stockholders of the Company who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
are entitled to demand and shall have properly and validly demanded their
statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Company Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, "Dissenting Company Shares") shall
not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration unless such stockholders fail to perfect, effectively withdraw
or waive or otherwise lose the right to appraisal. Such Company Stockholders
shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting
Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL,
except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by the stockholders of the
Company who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or waived or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be
considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in Section 3.9.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
and shall not agree to, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to
settle any such demands for payment, or 

waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or take any
other action with respect to such demand, in respect of Dissenting Company
Shares.

3.9 Surrender of Company Shares; Stock Transfer Books.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with
such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), which shall provide for the
payment by the Paying Agent of the amounts payable under Section 3.6(a) in
accordance with the terms of this Section 3.9. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent the aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 3.6(a) (the
"Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
The Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent.
No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
Article 3, and to the extent that there are net losses with respect to any
such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount of such net losses,
which additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. No
investment of the Exchange Fund shall have maturities that could prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the
Paying Agent will be payable to Parent. The Surviving Corporation shall bear
and pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent,
incurred in connection with the payment of funds to holders of Company Shares.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") and to each
holder of record of book-entry shares representing shares of Company Common
Stock (the "Book-Entry Shares"), in each case whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.6(a), (i)
a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or the Book-Entry Shares shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for
use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with a duly completed
and validly executed letter of transmittal or receipt of an "agent's message"
by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate or book-entry entitle such holder to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 3 and the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
any cash 

payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 3. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be properly transferred and the
Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Article 3 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificates or book entries, and, after the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article 3, except as otherwise provided by applicable law.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or one of its Affiliates, upon
demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws, as general creditors thereof) for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

(e) None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the earlier of (i) two years
after the Effective Time and (ii) immediately prior to the date on which the
Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or book entry pursuant to this Article 3
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority, then any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or
the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, subject
to such Person's compliance with the exchange procedures set forth in Section
3.9(b) (other than the 

surrender of a Certificate), issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the

follows:

4.1 Organization and Qualification; Company Subsidiaries.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good

carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have, or would not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Section 4.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate

Company (each a "Company Subsidiary"). Each Company Subsidiary is duly
organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure, individually or in the aggregate, would not have, or would be
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Other than the Company Subsidiaries, the Company does not directly or
indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or
entity.

4.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has heretofore made
available to Purchaser a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation and the Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, each as

Company Shares, par value of one tenth of one cent ($0.001) each and 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value of one tenth of one cent ($0.001) each
("Company Preferred Stock").

(d) As of August 20, 2014,

shares of Company Restricted Stock;

(ii) no Company Shares were held in the treasury of the Company;

(iii) no Company Shares were held by any Company Subsidiary;

Company Warrants shall be exercised in full (or net exercised) and converted
into such number of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(vi) 436,609 Company RSUs were outstanding;

(ix) all outstanding Company Shares are validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and are issued free of any preemptive rights.

(e) Except as set forth above and except for changes since August 20, 2014
resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options or vesting of Company
RSUs outstanding on such date, there are no outstanding (i) options, warrants,
calls or other rights, Contracts, arrangements or commitments of any character
relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or
sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in (or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such equity interests), the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) shares of capital stock of or other
voting securities or ownership interests in the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or (iii) restricted shares, restricted share units, stock
appreciation rights, performance shares, contingent value rights, "phantom"
stock or similar securities or rights that are derivative of or provide
economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any
capital stock or other voting securities (including any bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness having voting rights or convertible into or
exchangeable for securities having voting rights) or ownership interests in
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) being referred to collectively as the "Company Securities").

(f) All Company Shares subject to issuance, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and

to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to the
voting of any capital stock of, or other equity interest in, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

(g) There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Shares or any other Company Securities or any capital stock of any Company
Subsidiary or to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any
other person, other than Tax withholdings and exercise price settlements upon
the exercise of Company Stock Options or vesting of Company RSUs. Each
outstanding share of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and 

nonassessable and was issued free of any preemptive rights, and each such
share is owned by the Company or another Company Subsidiary free and clear of
all Liens or Contracts or other limitations on the Company's or any Company

(h) Section 4.3(f) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a listing of (i) all

absent termination of employment or other acceleration; and (vi) with respect
to Company Stock Options, whether or not such Company Stock Option is intended
to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of
the Code. Each grant of a Company Stock Option was duly authorized no later

to be effective (the "Grant Date") by all necessary corporate action,
including, as applicable, approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted
and authorized committee thereof), or a duly authorized delegate thereof, and
any required stockholder approval by the necessary number of votes or written
consents. The ESPP was duly authorized prior to the date any award or right
was granted thereunder by all necessary corporate action, including, as
applicable, approval by the Company Board and shareholder approval by the
necessary number of votes or written consents. Each Company Stock Option and
each Company RSU was granted in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Company Stock Plan and all other applicable Law; each such grant intended to
qualify as an incentive and the per share exercise price of each Company Stock
Option was not less than the fair market value of a Company Share on the
applicable Grant Date. No awards or rights have been granted under the ESPP.
No Company Stock Option or Company RSU is subject to any tax, penalty or
interest under Section 409A of the Code. No award has been granted, or is
currently outstanding, under any Company Stock Plan other than the Company
Stock Options and the Company RSUs. No Company Stock Option or Company RSU has
been granted, or is currently outstanding, other than Company Stock Options
and Company RSUs granted under the Company Stock Plans. The Company has no
obligations under or with respect to the ESPP and no purchase period is in
effect thereunder on the date of this Agreement.

4.4 Authority Relative to this Agreement.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject in
the case of the Merger to obtaining the Required Stockholder Vote, to
consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate

filing of appropriate certificate of merger as required by the DGCL). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and

similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights

other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought.

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held on August 21, 2014,
at which all of the directors of the Company were present (i) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger

the Company and holders of Company Shares, (ii) approved, adopted and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions (such approval, adoption and
declaration having been made in accordance with the DGCL), and (iii) resolved
to recommend that the holders of Company Shares approve and adopt this

organizational documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
subject to obtaining the Company Required Approvals and the Required
Stockholder Vote, conflict with or violate any U.S. or non-U.S. law

order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction ("Law") applicable
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or assets of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii) subject
to obtaining the consents or delivering the notices that are required to be
listed in Section 4.5(a)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule, result in any breach
of or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default or breach) under, or (except with respect to
Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and the ESPP in connection with the
treatment of such awards under Section 3.7 of this Agreement) give to others
any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, or result in the loss of a material
benefit under, any Company Material Contract or material Permit to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or to which any property, right
or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or materially
delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Merger or (y) have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, waiting period expiration or termination, authorization or
permit of, or filing with or notification 

to, any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, except for (i) the
filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC, (ii) applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and
state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws"), (iii) any required pre-
merger notification under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and similar requirements in foreign

to this Agreement and the Transactions ((i) to (vii) collectively, the
"Company Required Approvals"), and (viii) any such consent, approval, waiting
period expiration or termination, authorization, permit, filing or
notification the failure of which to make or obtain would not, or would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate (A) prevent or
materially delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Merger or (B)
have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.6 Permits; Compliance. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is
in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, certifications,
approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction,
including with respect to any Environmental Laws, necessary for each of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties
or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the "Permits"),
except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of
the Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to (x) prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of
the Merger or (y) have a Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or
cancellation of any of the Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, and there have occurred no defaults under, violations of,
or events giving rise to a right of termination, amendment or cancellation of
any such Permits (with or without notice, the lapse of time or both), except
where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of any of the
Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
(x) prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Merger or

Subsidiary is, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary during the
past three (3) years has been, in conflict with, or in default, breach or

or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
bound or affected, or (ii) any Company Material Contract or material Permit to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or any property or asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is bound, except for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches
or violations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to (x) prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of
the Merger or (y) have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction alleging that it is not in
compliance in all material respects with any Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for all purposes of the Agreement, the Company does not make any 

representation or warranty (pursuant to this Section 4.6 or elsewhere in the
Agreement) regarding the effect of the applicable antitrust, merger control,
competition, or fair trade laws on its ability to execute, deliver, or perform
its obligations under the Agreement or to consummate the transactions
described in this Agreement as a result of the enactment, promulgation,
application, or threatened or actual judicial or administrative investigation
or litigation under, or enforcement of, any antitrust, merger control,
competition, or fair trade law with respect to the consummation of the
transactions described in the Agreement.

other documents required to be filed by it with, or furnished to, the SEC

of such amendment), contain, or if filed after the date hereof at the time of
the filing will not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. No Company Subsidiary has been or is
required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC.

(d) (i) Each of the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the

normal and recurring year-end adjustments). (ii) The unaudited financial
information contained in the SEC Reports (such unaudited financial information

(e) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as December 28, 2013,
including the notes thereto (the "2013 Balance Sheet"), neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of a nature
required by GAAP to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company or the notes thereto, except for (x) liabilities and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the date of the 2013 Balance Sheet that have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, and (y) liabilities and obligations incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or as required by this Agreement.

(f) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (and each former principal executive officer

under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the SEC Reports,
and the statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. For
purposes of this Section 4.7(d), "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX. The Company is in
compliance in all material respects with SOX.

arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where
the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Company's or such Company Subsidiary's published financial statements or
otherwise in the SEC Reports.

(h) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act) and
accounting designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes, including to provide reasonable assurance that: (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
asset accountability; (iii) access to assets that could have a material 

effect on the Company's financial statements is permitted only in accordance
with management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

(i) The Company has in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to
ensure that material information that is required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and made known to its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. None of Ernst and Young
LLP and all other independent public accountants of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountant of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of or in connection with any
disagreement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary on a matter of

scope or procedure. The Company is in compliance in all material respects with
the applicable listing and other rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC.

(j) The Company has furnished or made available to Parent copies of all

thereto. There are no outstanding unresolved issues with respect to the
Company or the SEC Reports noted in comment letters or other correspondence
received by the Company or its attorneys from the SEC, and there are no
pending (i) formal or, to the knowledge of the Company, informal
investigations of the Company by the SEC or (ii) inspection of an audit of the
Company's financial statements by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board. There has been no material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that the Company or any Company Subsidiary has engaged in improper or illegal
accounting or auditing practices or maintains improper or inadequate internal
accounting controls. No current or former attorney representing the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a material violation
of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the
Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company
Board or any committee thereof or to any director or executive officer of the
Company.

(k) To the knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to any law

Company's whistleblower hot line or equivalent system for receipt of employee
concerns regarding possible violations of Laws.

(l) The Company has heretofore furnished or made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of all amendments and modifications that have not been
filed by the 

Company with the SEC to all Contracts, documents and other instruments that
previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC and are currently in
effect.

4.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the date of the 2013 Balance
Sheet through the date of this Agreement, except as contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice. Since the date of the 2013 Balance Sheet through the date of
this Agreement (i) there has not been any event, condition, circumstance,
development, change or effect, having, or that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii)
none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has taken any action
that if taken between the date hereof and the Effective Time would constitute
a material breach of Section 6.1 (other than as set forth in Section 4.8 of
the Disclosure Schedule). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for all purposes of
this Agreement, the Company does not make any representation or warranty
(pursuant to this Section 4.8 or elsewhere in the Agreement) regarding the
effect of the applicable antitrust, merger control, competition, or fair trade
laws on its ability to execute, deliver, or perform its obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions described in this Agreement as a
result of the enactment, promulgation, application, or threatened or actual
judicial or administrative investigation or litigation under, or enforcement
of, any antitrust, merger control, competition, or fair trade law with respect
to the consummation of the transactions described in this Agreement.

4.9 Absence of Litigation. There is (i) no Action pending, or (ii) to the
knowledge of the Company, no inquiry or investigation pending or Action
threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any of their
respective directors or executive officers in such capacity, or any property
or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that, in each case, (A)
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside
Date the consummation of the Transactions or (B) has had, or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, none of their
respective directors or executive officers in such capacity nor any property
or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject to any consent
decree, settlement agreement or similar written agreement between the Company
and any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that is materially
adverse to the Company, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree,
determination or award of any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to (x) prevent
or materially delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Merger or
(y) be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

and complete copy of each Plan and all amendments thereto and has made
available to Purchaser a true and complete copy of each material document, if

Contract to provide compensation or benefits to any individual other than in
the ordinary course of business, or (iii) to modify, change or terminate any

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate
maintains, contributes to or has an obligation to contribute to, or has any

contract, plan or arrangement covering any current or former director,
employee, or consultant of the Company that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to any payment or benefit as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as provided in this Agreement or as set
forth in Section 4.10(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (alone or together with any other event which, standing alone, would
not by itself trigger such entitlement or acceleration) will not (i) entitle
any Person to any payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
or increase in benefits under or with respect to any Plan, (ii) otherwise
trigger any acceleration (of vesting or payment of benefits or otherwise)
under or with respect to any Plan, or (iii) trigger any obligation to fund any

entitled to receive a gross-up payment from the Company with respect to any

Subsidiaries have performed all material obligations required to be performed
by them under each Plan and are not in material default under or in material
violation of, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no material
default or material violation by any party to, any Plan. No Action is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business)
and to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists that is
reasonably likely to give rise to any such Action.

(e) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code (i) has timely received a favorable determination, notification or
advisory letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions applicable to the

qualified and to the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Plan, (ii) has a remaining period of time under
applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for
such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable
determination, or (iii) may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype plan.
Each trust established in connection with any Plan that is intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code (x) has

knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be likely to adversely affect the exempt status of any such trust,

IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to make any
amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination, or (z) may rely upon

otherwise permitted as an investment option with respect to any Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(f) There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA) with respect to any US Plan. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under, arising out of or by
operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course),
including any liability in connection with (i) the termination or
reorganization of any Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) the
withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists that could give rise to any
such liability. There are no administrative investigations, audits, inquiries
or proceedings pending, in progress or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened by the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, or other
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction with respect to any Plan.
With respect to each Plan, (i) no actions, suits or claims (other than routine
claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened that would result in a material liability to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, no
facts or circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any such actions, suits or claims.

(g) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates, except as would not
result in material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. All
such contributions are or were fully deductible for federal income tax
purposes in all material respects and no such deduction has been challenged or
disallowed by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists that could be expected to
give rise to any such challenge or disallowance, in each case, except as would
not result in material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

plan" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code), to the
knowledge of the Company, (i) such plan has been operated since January 1,

guidance promulgated thereunder to the extent such plan is subject to Section
409A of the Code and so as to avoid any tax, interest or penalty thereunder;
(ii) the document or documents that evidence each such plan have conformed to
the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the final regulations under
Section 409A of the Code since December 31, 2008; and (iii) as to any such
plan in existence prior to January 1, 2005 and not subject to Section 409A of

Representations and Warranties of Parent and Purchaser. 

Parent and Purchaser hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
the Company that:

5.1 Corporate Organization. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and
Purchaser is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent and Purchaser
from performing any of their material obligations under this Agreement.

5.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Each of Parent and Purchaser has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser
and the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the Transactions have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with
respect to the Merger, the filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable
against each of Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except that
(i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors' rights generally, and (ii) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought.

5.3 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not,
(i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
either Parent or Purchaser, 

(ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, waiting period terminations or
expirations, authorizations and other actions described in Section 5.3(b) have
been obtained and all filings and obligations described in Section 5.3(b) have
been made, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Purchaser
or by which any property or asset of either of them is bound or affected, or
(iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default or breach) under, or
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset
of Parent or Purchaser pursuant to, or result in the loss of a material
benefit under any Contract, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Purchaser is a party or by which Parent or
Purchaser or any property or asset of either of them is bound or affected,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent and Purchaser from performing any of
their material obligations under this Agreement.

(d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not,
require any consent, approval, waiting period termination or expiration,
authorization or permit of, or filing with, or notification to, any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, except for (i) applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and Blue Sky Laws, (ii) any required pre-merger notification under
the HSR Act, and similar requirements in foreign countries regarding antitrust
or competition matters and any associated consents, approvals, authorizations,
waiting period terminations, or permits (including those set forth on Section
4.5(b) of the Disclosure Schedule), (iii) the filing of appropriate
certificate of merger as required by the DGCL, (iv) notice to CFIUS pursuant
to the Exon-Florio Amendment and any associated determination or decision, and
(v) notice to the U.S. State Department, Directorate for Defense Trade
Controls (DTCC), under ITAR, relating to this Agreement and the Transactions,
and (vi) any such consent, approval, waiting period expiration or termination,
authorization, permit, filing or notification the failure of which to make or
obtain would not, or would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate (A) prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date the
consummation of the Merger or (B) otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from
performing their mutual obligations under this Agreement.

5.4 Financing. Parent has, and at the Effective Time, Parent shall have and
shall make available or cause one or more of its affiliates to make available
to Purchaser sufficient cash and other sources of immediately available funds
to purchase and pay for all of the Company Shares that may be converted into
the Per Share Amount in the Merger and to pay all fees and expenses in
connection therewith.

5.5 Absence of Litigation. There is no material Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, threatened against Parent, any subsidiary of
Parent, or any property or asset of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent, before
any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that is reasonably likely
to prevent or delay the consummation of any Transaction or otherwise prevent
or delay Parent or Purchaser from performing their material obligations under
this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any subsidiary of Parent nor any property
or 

asset of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent is subject to any material
continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written
agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, continuing
investigation by, any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, or any
order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that is reasonably likely to
prevent consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser
from performing their material obligations under this Agreement.

5.6 Purchaser. All of the outstanding capital stock of Purchaser is owned by
Parent. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its
incorporation or organization or the negotiation and consummation of this
Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions, Purchaser has not incurred any
obligations or liabilities, and has not engaged in any business or activities
of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any Contracts or arrangements
with any person or entity.

at any time during the last three (3) years has it been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203(c) of the DGCL (other
than as contemplated by this Agreement). Prior to the date hereof, neither
Parent nor Purchaser has taken, or authorized or permitted any Representatives
of Parent or Purchaser to take, any action that would reasonably be expected
to cause, Parent, Purchaser or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" to be
deemed an "interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

5.8 Vote Required. No vote of the holders of any of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement and the
Transactions.

5.9 Proxy Statement. The information supplied by Parent to the Company
specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, at the date first
mailed to stockholders of the Company, and at the time of the Stockholders'
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

not false or misleading, or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the
Stockholders' Meeting that shall have become false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser make no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by the Company or any of its
representatives for inclusion in any of the foregoing documents. The
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in Proxy Statement shall comply
in all material respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act

the DCGL) or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover
provision in the Company's organizational documents, in each case inapplicable
to any person (other than Parent, Purchaser or any of their affiliates) or any
Acquisition Proposal (and to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company
shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have
been heretofore granted to any such person or Acquisition Proposal under any
such provisions).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if at any time following
the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Required Stockholder Vote, in
response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) is, or
would reasonably be likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company may,
subject to compliance with Section 7.5, (x) furnish information regarding the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement;
provided, that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or
is provided to Parent prior to or promptly following the time it is provided
to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such 

Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition
Proposal, but only if and to the extent that in connection with the foregoing
clauses (x) and (y), (A) none of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall have breached or
taken any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in this
Section 7.5, (B) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and (C) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information to, or entering into discussions with, such Person, the Company
gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and of the
Company's intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
discussions with, such Person, and the Company receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement in a customary form that is no less
favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement, unless the
Company already has an executed confidentiality agreement in place with such
Person. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the obtaining the
Required Stockholder Vote, the Company may, to the extent the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach by the Company
Board of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, not enforce any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party for the sole purpose of allowing the other party
to such agreement to submit an Acquisition Proposal, or with respect to
another party that has submitted an Acquisition Proposal, solely with respect
to such submission, that will constitute, or is reasonably likely to lead to,
a Superior Proposal, that did not, in each case, result from a breach by the
Company of this Section 7.5; provided, however, that if the Company waives any
standstill or similar provision with respect to any Person, then the terms of
any standstill or similar provision in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
waived.

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, which did not result from
or arise in connection with a breach of this Section 7.5, made by a Third
Party that, if consummated, would result in such Third Party's (or its
stockholders') owning, directly or indirectly, greater than 50% of the equity
securities of the Company (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a
merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger)
or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and that (i) the Company Board determines in
good faith after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and its outside legal counsel to be more favorable from
a financial point of view (including potential tax benefits) and on an overall
basis, including the likelihood of consummation, to the Company's stockholders
than the Merger (after taking into account all terms and conditions of such
proposal and of this Agreement, including (1) any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise, including
pursuant to Section 7.5(b)(ii) or (iii), (2) whether the proposal is
reasonably capable of being completed by such Third Party (taking into
account, among other things, the expectation of obtaining required regulatory
approvals) and (3) if financing is required, whether such financing is
reasonably available to the Third Party).

(h) (i) Except as set forth in this Section 7.5, until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms hereof, neither 

the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (x) (A) withdraw, modify,
amend or qualify or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in
any manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation,
(B) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer
for the Company Common Stock within five (5) business days of the commencement
of such offer, (C) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing in clauses (A)-(C),
a "Change in Recommendation"), or (y) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose
to adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
Contract constituting or related to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 7.5) (including those that
require or are reasonably expected to cause, the Company to abandon,
terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise materially
impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Transactions) (any of the
foregoing, an "Acquisition Agreement").

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time prior to obtaining the
Required Stockholder Vote if an event, fact, development, circumstance or
occurrence that affects the business, assets or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries that was not known to the Company as of the date hereof (or,
if known, the consequences of which are not known to the Company Board as of
the date hereof) becomes known by the Company Board after the date hereof or
the material consequences thereof become known to the Company Board after the
date hereof and prior to obtaining the Required Stockholder Vote, effect a
Change in Recommendation; provided, however, that the Company Board may not
effect a Change in Recommendation unless the Company shall have provided prior
written notice to Parent at least four (4) calendar days in advance of its
intention to take such action, and prior to effecting such Change in
Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
during such four (4) calendar day period, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Change in
Recommendation is no longer necessary; and provided, further, that the Company
Board shall not be permitted to effect a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
this Section 7.5(b)(ii) with respect to or in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal (which shall be covered by and subject in all respects to Section
7.5(b)(iii)).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Required Stockholder Vote, the Company Board
may in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior
Proposal and that was made after the date of this Agreement and did not result
from or arise in connection with a breach of this Section 7.5, (A) make a
Change in Recommendation if the Company Board has concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of the
receipt of such Superior Proposal (after giving effect to 

all of the adjustments to this Agreement which may be offered by Parent during
the Notice Period), that failure to make such Change in Recommendation would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (B) cause the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g) in order to, concurrently with such
termination, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of the receipt of such Superior
Proposal, that failure to so terminate this Agreement would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; provided, that the Company shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company
pays by wire transfer of immediately available funds the Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 9.1(g); provided, further, that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.5(b)(iii) unless (x) the
Company has provided a written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior
Proposal") advising Parent that the Company has received a Superior Proposal,
and (y) Parent does not, within four (4) calendar days following its receipt
of the Notice of Superior Proposal (the "Notice Period"), make an offer that,
as determined by the Company Board, results in the applicable Acquisition
Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal (provided that, during the Notice
Period, the Company shall, if so requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith,
and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good faith, with
Parent with respect to any revised proposal from Parent in respect of the
terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), it being further
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require the delivery to Parent
of a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new Notice Period.

(i) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours advise Parent
orally and in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including
for the avoidance of doubt any request for information or other inquiry which
the Company could reasonably expect to lead to an Acquisition Proposal),
including the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
(including any changes or material updates thereto) and the identity of the
person making such Acquisition Proposal and attaching a copy of any such
written Acquisition Proposal, or if such Acquisition Proposal is provided
orally to the Company, the Company shall summarize in writing the terms of
such Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of doubt any such
request or other inquiry).

(j) Nothing contained in this Section 7.5 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) making any disclosure to the holders of Company Shares
if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to make such disclosure could reasonably
be expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law (provided that each such disclosure shall include a
public reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation), or (ii) taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange
offer by a Third Party as contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act or making a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act or under Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act; provided, that (x) any such disclosure, if the Company Board
expressly publicly 

reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such communication, or (y) any
"stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, shall not be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation; provided, further that this Section 7.5(d) shall not be deemed
to permit the Company's Board or any committee thereof to make a Change in
Recommendation except as expressly permitted by Section 7.5(d).

7.6 Employee Benefits Matters.

(a) If so directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Board will adopt (and will cause any other sponsor
of the applicable Plan to adopt), at least five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Time, resolutions terminating any and all Plans intended to qualify
as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code,
effective no later than the day immediately preceding the date the Company
becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in
Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent, and the
Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions have been adopted
by the Company Board or the board of directors of the Company Subsidiaries or
any other applicable Plan sponsor, as applicable. The Company shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent
may reasonably request.

(b) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date
that is the first anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date
of the Continuing Employee's termination of employment), the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and/or their respective subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall provide each Continuing Employee with (i) an annual base
salary (for salaried employees) or base hourly pay rate (for hourly employees)
that are no less than the base salary or base hourly pay rate, as applicable,
that are provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the date
hereof, and (ii) defined contribution retirement benefits and welfare benefits
(excluding severance) that are no less than the defined contribution
retirement benefits and welfare benefits that are provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the date hereof, provided that this undertaking
shall not obligate Parent to continue the employment of such Continuing
Employees for any period following the Effective Time, and such Continuing
Employees may be terminated by Parent at any time (except to the extent
otherwise restricted by Law and subject to any contractual arrangements
between the Company and any individual employee, as in effect on the date
hereof).

(c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility and levels of benefits (but not
benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan, retiree medical plan or frozen
benefit plan of Parent or vesting under any equity incentive plan) under any
employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries in which Company Employees
are eligible to participate following the Effective Time (each, an "Eligible
Plan"), Parent will credit (or cause to be credited) each Continuing Employee
with his or her years of service with the Company before the Effective Time,
to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing will not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a 

duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, Parent will, subject in each case to receipt of any required consent
of the applicable Plan provider, cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Eligible Plans, (ii) for purposes of each Eligible Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
Eligible Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) for the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each Continuing Employee with any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Eligible Plan.

(d) Parent will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in
accordance with their terms, the individual agreements listed on Section
7.6(d) of the Disclosure Schedule following the Effective Time.

(e) On the first payroll date in the month following the month in which the
Merger Closing Date occurs (provided that such date shall not be sooner than
the first payroll date in January 2015), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay a cash bonus to each Continuing Employee who
remains on the Company's payroll as of the Merger Closing Date and is a
participant in the Company's Incentive Bonus Plan equal to a prorated portion
of each such Continuing Employee's annual target bonus in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable deductions and
withholdings.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall (x) create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or service provider or former service provider (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
in any respect, including in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment), or create any such rights in any such persons in respect of any
benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Plan or any
employee or service provider program or arrangement of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries (including any Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time),
or (y) constitute or be construed to constitute an amendment to any of the
compensation or benefit plans maintained for or provided to employees or other
persons prior to or following the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement
shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate any
such plans or arrangements of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including any
Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time).

7.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to any indemnification, exculpation or advance of expense or
similar agreement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in favor of any
present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the
Company and any Company Subsidiary (the "Indemnification Agreements") (and all
other indemnification agreements of the Company that are on terms
substantially similar to the Indemnification Agreements) and any
indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses 

provisions under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) as in effect immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement; provided, that such obligations shall be subject to any limitation
imposed from time to time under applicable Law.

(j) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and for six (6) years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide officers' and directors' liability, fiduciary
liability and similar insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each
Indemnified Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the Company's
DandO Insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement as
well as covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person under ERISA;
provided, that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.7(b), the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in the
aggregate in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its
last full fiscal year, which amount the Company has disclosed to Parent prior
to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, and prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may, with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), purchase a "tail" directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy, covering the same persons and
providing the same terms with respect to coverage and premium amount as
aforesaid, and that by its terms shall provide coverage until the sixth annual
anniversary of the Effective Time, and upon the purchase of such insurance
Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 7.7(b) shall be deemed satisfied for so long as such
insurance is in full force and effect and covers the matters that would
otherwise be covered pursuant to Section 7.7(b).

(k) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.7 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

(l) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.

7.8 Anti-Takeover Statutes. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and Company Board
shall grant such reasonable approval and take such reasonable action as
necessary so that such transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Law on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

7.9 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent and Purchaser in writing of: (i) any representation or warranty made by
the Company 

contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the
conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) would not, or would reasonably not be
expected to, be satisfied, or such that the consummation of the Transactions
is expected to be materially delayed or (x) any failure of the Company to
comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it under this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(b) would not, or
would reasonably not be expected to, be satisfied, or such that the
consummation of the Transactions is expected to be materially delayed; (ii)
the occurrence or existence of any Effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect; and (iii) other than as disclosed pursuant to Section 7.10,
any Actions commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or
Parent and any of its affiliates, as the case may be, that, if pending on the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to any Section of this Agreement or that relate to the consummation
of the Transactions. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company in writing
of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Purchaser contained in
this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent or
Purchaser to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it
under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in
Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(b) would not, or would reasonably be expected
to, be satisfied, or such that the consummation of the Transactions is
expected to be materially delayed.

7.10 Litigation. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that shall be instituted or
threatened in writing against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise
challenge the legality of or seek damages in connection with this Agreement or
any Transaction. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the others of any new
action, suit, proceeding or investigation that is instituted or threatened in
writing against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, Purchaser or
Parent, as the case may be, that would have been listed in Section 4.9 of the
Disclosure Schedule or otherwise disclosed, if such action, suit, proceeding
or investigation had arisen prior to the date hereof. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate at Parent's expense in (but not control)
the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation or claims against the
Company or any of its directors relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions. The Company shall not settle or make an offer to settle any
litigation against the Company or any director by any stockholder relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions, without the prior written consent of
Parent; provided, further, that after receipt of the Required Stockholder
Vote, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and, if requested by Parent, use
its reasonable best efforts to settle any unresolved stockholder litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, in accordance
with Parent's direction, except that in no event shall the Company be required
to agree to any such settlement that would require the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking any action, or to pay any
amount, prior to the Merger Closing.

7.11 Consents and Approvals.

(r) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly (x) prepare and file all necessary documentation and (y) effect
all applications, notices, petitions and filings (including, to the extent
necessary, any notification required by the HSR Act, as more specifically 

addressed in Section 7.12) and (z) obtain all permits, consents, waiting
period expiration or terminations, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities that are necessary and reasonably deemed
advisable by both parties to consummate the Transactions, including those set
forth on Section 4.5(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, the CFIUS Approval and
notice to the U.S. State Department, Directorate for Defense Trade Controls
under ITAR, relating to this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company shall
also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents required to be
listed on Section 4.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. The parties hereto shall
consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all such permits,
consents, approvals, waiting period expiration or terminations and
authorizations, and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the Transactions. Parent and the Company
shall each, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions.
Parent and the Company, with respect to any threatened or pending preliminary
or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule,
regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of the
parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, shall use
reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation
thereof, as the case may be.

(s) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of any of the Transactions relating to any such
consent or approval.

(t) This Section 7.11 is subject to, in all respects, the provisions of
Section 7.12(b) below.

7.12 HSR Act Filing, International Antitrust Notifications and Other
Governmental Approvals and Notices.

(j) As promptly as reasonably possible after the date of this Agreement and in
any event within fifteen (15) business days, if required by any Law, each of
Parent and the Company shall, or shall cause their ultimate parent entity as
that term is defined in the HSR Act and its implementing regulations to, file
with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of
the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") a pre-merger
notification in accordance with the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the
other Transactions pursuant to this Agreement. As promptly as reasonably
possible after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within fifteen
(15) business days, each of the Company and Parent shall file an antitrust
notification in any other jurisdiction if required by any Law, including as
set forth on Section 4.5(b) of the Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of
doubt, if only one antitrust notification is required in a jurisdiction,
Parent shall be responsible for making such filing as promptly as reasonable
possible after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within fifteen
(15) business days. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish promptly to
the FTC, the Antitrust Division and any other requesting Governmental
Authority any additional information requested by any of them pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other antitrust or related Law in connection with such filings.
To the extent permitted by Law, each of Parent and the Company shall consult
in advance and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in 

connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act
or any foreign or other antitrust Law. Parent and the Company shall cooperate
fully with each other in connection with the making of all such filings or
responses. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Authority or by any applicable law, each party hereto will permit authorized
representatives of the other parties to attend any meeting, communication, or
conference with any Governmental Authority in connection with such proceedings
under or relating to the HSR Act or any foreign or other antitrust Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall provide to
the other (or the other's respective advisors) upon request copies of all
correspondence between such party and any Governmental Authority relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties may, as they deem
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials
provided to the other under this Section 7.12 as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written
consent of the party providing such materials.

(k) Subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions or restrictions
required by Law, Parent and Company will notify the other promptly upon the
receipt of (i) any comments, questions, or requests for information or
documents from any Governmental Authority in connection with any filings made
pursuant to Section 7.12(a) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) any request by any Governmental Authority for amendments or
supplements to any filings made pursuant to any Laws relating to an
investigation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Whenever any
event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
any filing made pursuant to this Section, or whenever a Governmental Authority
requests information or documents related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each party hereto will promptly inform the other of such
occurrence or request and cooperate in filing or producing promptly with the
applicable Governmental Authority such amendment, supplement, information or
documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party hereto
shall provide to the other (or the other's respective advisors) upon request
copies of all correspondence between such party and any Governmental Authority
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties
hereto may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively
sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section 7.12 as "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient
without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In
addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone
calls, and meetings with a Governmental Authority regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall include representatives of both parties.
Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with
each other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any
Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by or on behalf of any party.

(l) Each of the parties hereto shall exercise reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate 

with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the CFIUS Approval, including (i) within fifteen (15) business days
after the date of this Agreement, make the draft filing with CFIUS
contemplated under 31 C.F.R. § 800.401(f) with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and engage in the pre-notice consultation process with
CFIUS, (ii) following such pre-notice consultation, as promptly as practicable
and, in any event, within five (5) business days of CFIUS notification that
the draft filing meets all requirements of 31 C.F.R. § 800.402 of the
regulations and is, accordingly, complete, file with CFIUS a voluntary notice
as contemplated by 31 C.F.R. § 800.401(a) and in the case of Parent and

the Company and the Company subsidiaries to provide, all financial information
regarding the Company and the Company subsidiaries that Parent and Purchaser
may reasonably request, including unaudited and audited balance sheets and

required to assist in the preparation of pro forma financial statements by

other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, and (y) in connection with any actions by the

substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any
business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be
expected to: (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially
increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority seeking or entering an Order
prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions; (iii) materially increase
the risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or

shall be automatically extended an additional four (4) months if all of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 8 (other than Section 8.1(c))
shall have been satisfied or waived pursuant to the terms hereof as of the
initial Outside Date (prior to such extension, "Outside Date" shall mean
December 22, 2014, and from and after such extension, "Outside Date" shall
mean April 22, 2015); provided, further, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party

issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or
ruling or other Law that (x) makes acceptance for payment of, or payment for,

prohibited, or (y) enjoins Purchaser and the Company from consummating the
Merger, and, in each case, such order, injunction, judgment, judicial
decision, decree or ruling or Law shall have become final and non-appealable;
provided, however, that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement shall
have used its reasonable best efforts to have such order, injunction,
judgment, judicial decision, decree or ruling avoided or lifted; or

(vi) CFIUS shall have notified the parties that it intends to recommend that
the President disapprove, block, or deny approval to the Merger; or

not be 

satisfied; provided, however, if such breach or inaccuracy is capable of being
cured prior to the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) the date that is
twenty (20) business days from the date the Company is notified in writing by

(l) By either Parent or Purchaser, if following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, there shall have occurred a Material Adverse Effect that is

of a tender or exchange offer or public announcement or public notice of an
Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party after written request from Parent to
do so; (iv) the Company shall have failed to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (it being agreed that the delivery of a
Notice of Designated Superior Proposal and any amendment or update to such
notice and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
and public disclosure with respect thereto shall not, by itself, give rise to
a right for Parent to terminate this Agreement); or (vi) the Company or the
Company Board shall publicly propose to do any of the actions specified in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this Section 9.1(e); or

the date that is twenty (20) business days from the date Parent is notified in
writing by the Company of such breach, the Company may not terminate the
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(f) (x) prior to such date if Parent and
Purchaser are taking reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy and
(y) following such date if such inaccuracy or breach is cured at or prior to
such date; or

(o) By the Company in accordance with Section 7.5(b)(iii), but only if the
Company shall have complied with its obligations under Section 7.5 and is
otherwise permitted to accept the applicable Superior Proposal pursuant to
Section 7.5(b)(iii), provided that the Company, 

concurrently with such termination, (x) enters into the definitive agreement
providing for the implementation of such Superior Proposal and (y) pays the
Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Section 9.3; or

(p) By Parent, Purchaser or the Company, if the Stockholders' Meeting shall
have been held and completed, and approval and adoption of this Agreement by
the stockholders of the Company referred to in Section 7.1(a) shall not have
been obtained at such Stockholders' Meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(h) shall not be available to any party whose
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
substantial or primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure to obtain such
approval and adoption of the stockholders.

9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there
shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or their
respective officers, directors, stockholders, or affiliates; provided, that,
(a) Section 7.4(b) (Confidentiality), Section 7.16 (Public Announcements),
Section 9.3 (Fees), Section 10 (General Provisions) and this Section 9.2 shall
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement,
and (b) such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any
fraud or willful breach of its representations or warranties or covenants
hereunder. A termination of this Agreement shall not cause a termination of
the Confidentiality Agreement or any other agreement between the parties. For
the purpose hereof, the term "willful breach" shall mean a breach that is a
consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge
(actual or constructive) that the taking of such act would, or would be
reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

9.3 Fees and Expenses.

(k) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by Parent, Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) or
Section 9.1(h), so long as, (x) an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party shall
have been publicly announced after the date hereof and prior to such
termination, and (y) within 12 months after such termination (A) the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
(B) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (with all references to 20% in the
definition thereof being treated as references to 50.1% for purposes of this
Section 9.3(a));

(ii) by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(e);

(iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(g); or

(iv) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c) if the Company is
then in material breach of its covenants or agreements, so long as in each
case, (x) an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party shall have been publicly
announced after the date hereof and prior to such termination, and (y) within
12 months after such termination (A) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (B) an Acquisition
Proposal 

is consummated (with all references to 20% in the definition thereof being
treated as references to 50.1% for purposes of this Section 9.3(a)).

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee,
which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
The Termination Fee shall be paid (x) in the circumstances described in clause
(i) above, promptly (but in no event later than two (2) business days)
following the first to occur of the events giving rise to the obligation to
make such payment, (y) in the circumstances described in clause (ii) above,
within four (4) business days of the termination, and (z) in the circumstances
described in clause (iii) above, concurrently with and as a condition to the
termination.

(l) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Purchaser pursuant
to Section 9.1(c), then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds), within five (5) business days of the Company's
receipt of a detailed written itemization of Parent's Expenses, Expenses
actually incurred by Parent and/or Purchaser on or prior to the termination of
this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the total Expenses
to be paid by the Company to Parent exceed one and a half million dollars
($1,500,000) (the "Expense Cap").

(m) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 9.1(f), then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds), within five (5) business days
of Parent's receipt of a detailed written itemization of the Company's
Expenses, Expenses actually incurred by the Company on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the
total Expenses to be paid by Parent to the Company exceed the Expense Cap.

(n) [RESERVED]

(o) Except as set forth in this Section 9.3, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not any Transaction is consummated.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Purchaser shall be responsible for the
payment of all antitrust filing fees, including the filing fee under the HSR
Act; provided, in the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or
Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(c), then the Company shall pay to Parent (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds), within five (5) business days
of such termination, such filing fees.

(p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent
and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its affiliates
that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts,
expenses and resources expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The Company acknowledges
and hereby agrees that the provisions of this Section 9.3 are an integral part
of the Transactions, and that, without such provisions, the Parent would not
have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amounts due 

pursuant to Section 9.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
Purchaser commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for
the amounts set forth in Section 9.3 or any portion thereof, the Company shall
pay to the Parent or Purchaser its reasonable and documented out of pocket
costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of
Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment.

(q) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parent's receipt
of payment of the Termination Fee and Expenses pursuant to this Section 9.3
(plus, in the case the Termination Fee is not timely paid, the amounts
described in the second sentence of Section 9.3(c)), in circumstances in which
the Termination Fee and/or Expenses are payable, shall constitute the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy of Parent and Purchaser and their respective
affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, trustees,
officers, employees, agents or affiliates (the "Parent Related Parties")
against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively, the "Company Related Parties")
for all any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements), judgments,
inquiries and fines suffered in respect of this Agreement (including in
respect of any breach, whether or not willful and intentional, of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or the failure of the Merger
to be consummated) or the Transactions in such circumstances, and upon payment
of the Termination Fee and/or Expenses to Parent pursuant to this Section 9.3,
none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation to any of the Parent Related Parties relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions, other than as a result of fraud; provided,
however, this Section 9.5(g) shall not limit the right of the parties hereto
to specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.6 prior to
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee and/or Expenses on more than one occasion.

exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms hereof without posting a bond or undertaking, in
addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

10.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law. All actions and proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court
of Chancery, or if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, then the
Federal courts located in the State of Delaware (collectively, the "Delaware
Courts"). The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Delaware Courts for the purpose of any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably
waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any
such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum,
that 

the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the
Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

10.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. Each of the
parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.8.

10.9 General Interpretation.

(m) The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

(n) Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to Sections, Articles,
Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules shall be deemed to refer to Sections, Articles,
Annexes, Exhibits or Schedules of or to this Agreement, as applicable.

(o) Unless otherwise indicated, the words "include," "includes" and
"including," when used herein, shall be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words "without limitation."

(p) The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document.

(q) The phrase "made available to Parent" when used herein, shall mean that
the subject documents were uploaded to the electronic data room maintained by
the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement or were otherwise
provided to Parent.

10.10 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action
taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any time
prior to the Effective Time; provided, that, in the event that this Agreement
has been adopted by the stockholders of the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires the
approval of the stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law or the rules of
the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, without such approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

10.11 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any
other party hereto, 

(b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of any other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c)
waive compliance with any agreement of any other party or any condition to its
own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is
specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

10.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by
facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Purchaser and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
