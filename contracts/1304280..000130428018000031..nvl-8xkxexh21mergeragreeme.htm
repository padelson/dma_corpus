Days after) the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each Stockholder a letter of transmittal, including
instructions (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent prior to the Effective Time) (a "Letter of Transmittal") for the
surrender of book-entry shares of Common Stock ("Book-Entry Shares") or
certificates representing shares of Common Stock (the "Certificates"), which
will specify that delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree and
include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Book Entry Shares
or Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the
Per Share Merger Consideration and the payments, if any, set forth in Section
3.5(g) and Section 8.2(f)(ii), in each case, in accordance with the provisions
hereof, with respect to the shares of Common Stock formerly represented
thereby. If, after the Effective Time, a Dissenting Stockholder effectively
withdraws its demand for, fails to perfect, or loses its, appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares,
Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent
additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of

demand for, failed to perfect, or lost its, appraisal rights pursuant to 





Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company
and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Paying Agent
to (i) deliver a Letter of Transmittal to the Stockholders of the Company at
least five (5) Business Days prior to, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after, the Effective Time, and (ii) assuming delivery to the
Paying Agent of a Letter of Transmittal and surrender of the related Book-
Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with this Section 3.2(b) by any
such Stockholder prior to the Closing Date, pay to such Stockholder the Per
Share Merger Consideration in respect of such Stockholder's shares on the
first (1st) Business Day following the Closing Date.

(ii) Payment for Shares. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of a Letter of
Transmittal by any Stockholder, duly completed and validly signed in
accordance with its instructions, and surrender of Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented such shares of Common Stock (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) (other than with respect to Excluded Shares), such
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
in respect of such shares, and the Book-Entry Shares or Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be delivered upon compliance
with the procedures described above, may be issued to the transferee if the
Paying Agent receives documents reasonably required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer taxes have been
paid or that transfer taxes are not applicable. All cash paid as Per Share
Merger Consideration upon the surrender of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the applicable shares of Common
Stock. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable as provided
above.

(b) Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Stockholders for one (1) year after the Effective

Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation. Any Stockholder (other than with
respect to Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article
III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) for, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of the applicable Per Share
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for such Stockholder's
shares of Common Stock upon surrender of its Book-Entry Shares or Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof). Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of shares of Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(c) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration in 





respect of the number of shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

Section 3.3 No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock. The merger
consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to all
shares of Common Stock (and all Options and all RSUs), and after the Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Common Stock (or Options or
RSUs) that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the Stockholders shall cease to have any rights with respect
to shares of Common Stock, all Optionholders shall cease to have any rights
with respect to Options and all RSU Holders shall cease to have any rights
with respect to RSUs, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Book-Entry Shares or Certificates that

Commercial Margin for such Earn-Out Period, and based on such calculation,
Parent's proposed calculation of the Earn-Out Consideration for such Earn-Out
Period. At the Stockholders 





Representative's reasonable written request, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees, agents
and representatives to, provide reasonable assistance during regular business
hours to the Stockholders Representative and its agents in their review of the
Proposed Earn-Out Statement and shall provide the Stockholders Representative
and its agents access at reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably
necessary for such purpose and for the other purposes set forth in this
Section 3.5, subject to execution of any applicable customary access letters
required by accountants. The Commercial Margin and Earn-Out Consideration for

3.5, shall be deemed to be the final and binding calculations of the
Commercial Margin and Earn-Out Consideration for such Earn-Out Period for all
purposes of this Agreement.

Representative disputes the accuracy of a Proposed Earn-Out Statement, the
Stockholders Representative shall notify Parent in writing of its objections
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Proposed Earn-Out Statement
(each, an "Earn-Out Review Period") and shall set forth, in writing and in
reasonable detail, the reasons for the Stockholders Representative's
objections (subject to the following proviso, an "Earn-Out Notice of
Disagreement"); provided, however, that an Earn-Out Notice of Disagreement
shall include only objections based on (1) the failure of the calculations set
forth on the applicable Proposed Earn-Out Statement to be prepared in a manner
consistent with the applicable defined terms of Earn-Out Consideration and
Commercial Margin or (2) mathematical errors in the computation of any amount
set forth on the applicable Proposed Earn-Out Statement. Any component of a
Proposed Earn-Out Statement as to which no objection is raised in an Earn-Out
Notice of Disagreement shall be deemed final and binding on the parties for
all purposes of this Agreement.

(c) Initial Method of Resolution. During the fifteen (15) days immediately
following the delivery of an Earn-Out Notice of Disagreement, Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to any matter specified in such
Earn-Out Notice of Disagreement. During such period, Parent and the
Stockholders Representative and their respective agents shall each have
reasonable access to the other party's working papers, trial balances and
similar materials prepared in connection with the other party's preparation of
the applicable Proposed Earn-Out Statement and the applicable Earn-Out Notice
of Disagreement, as the case may be; provided, that such access will be
subject to the execution of any applicable customary access letters required
by accountants. The matters set forth in any such written resolution executed
by Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall be final and binding on
the parties on the date of such written resolution for all purposes of this
Agreement.

(d) Dispute Resolution Procedure. If, at the end of such fifteen (15) day
period specified in Section 3.5(c) (or such longer period agreed to between
Parent and the Stockholders Representative), Parent and the Stockholders
Representative have not been able to resolve, in writing, all differences that
they may have with respect to any matter specified in the applicable Earn-Out
Notice of Disagreement, Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall
submit to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreed
to by Parent and the 





Stockholders Representative, or if Parent and the Stockholders Representative
are unable to agree on a nationally recognized independent accounting firm,
then a nationally recognized independent accounting firm that is assigned by
the American Arbitration Association (the "Accounting Firm"), for review and
resolution of solely those matters specified in such Earn-Out Notice of
Disagreement that remain in dispute (and as to no other matter), and the
Accounting Firm shall reach a final, binding resolution of such matters, which
final resolution shall not be subject to collateral attack for any reason and
shall be (i) in writing and signed by the Accounting Firm, (ii) within the
range of the amount of each item in dispute contested by the Stockholders
Representative and Parent on an item by item basis, (iii) furnished to Parent
and the Stockholders Representative as soon as practicable after the items in
dispute have been referred to the Accounting Firm, which shall not be more
than sixty (60) days after such referral, (iv) made in accordance with the
applicable defined terms of Earn-Out Consideration and Commercial Margin, and
(v) conclusive and binding upon the parties on the date of delivery of such
written resolution for all purposes of this Agreement. The scope of the
disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to fixing
mathematical errors and determining whether the items in dispute were
determined in accordance with the applicable defined terms of Earn-Out
Consideration and Commercial Margin. Parent and the Stockholders
Representative agree to execute, if requested by the Accounting Firm, a
reasonable engagement letter in customary form. Parent and the Stockholders
Representative agree to cooperate in good faith with the Accounting Firm and
promptly provide all documents and information reasonably requested by the
Accounting Firm so as to enable it to make such determination as quickly and
as accurately as practicable. The procedure outlined in this Section 3.5(d) is
referred to as the "Earn-Out Dispute Resolution Procedure".

(e) Final Earn-Out Statement. A Proposed Earn-Out Statement shall become a
"Final Earn-Out Statement" on the earlier of (w) the first (1st) day following
the end of the applicable Earn-Out Review Period, if an Earn-Out Notice of
Disagreement has not been delivered to Parent by the Stockholders
Representative, (x) the date upon which the Stockholders Representative
acknowledges in writing that it has no objections to a Proposed Earn-Out
Statement, (y) the date of resolution of all matters set forth in the
applicable Earn-Out Notice of Disagreement pursuant to Section 3.5(c) and (z)
the date upon which the Accounting Firm reaches a final, binding resolution of
solely those matters specified in the applicable Earn-Out Notice of
Disagreement pursuant to Section 3.5(d) . The date on which a Proposed Earn-
Out Statement shall become a Final Earn-Out Statement pursuant to the
immediately foregoing sentence is referred to as a "Final Earn-Out
Determination Date".

(f) Earn-Out Dispute Resolution Expenses. Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Earn-Out Dispute Resolution Procedure. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated to and borne by Parent and
the Stockholders Representative based on the inverse of the percentage that
the Accounting Firm's determination (before such allocation) bears to the
total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the
Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to
$1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Stockholders
Representative's position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by
Parent and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Stockholders Representative. 





(g) Payment of Earn-Out Consideration. No later than the tenth (10th) Business
Day following the Final Earn-Out Determination Date for any Earn-Out
Consideration, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid (subject to reduction,
offset or deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Account, in each case, in accordance
with Section 8.2(d)), the amount of the Earn-Out Consideration (if any) for
such Earn-Out Period (i) to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the
Stockholders and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation for payroll processing and
distribution at the next administratively practicable payroll date to each
Optionholder of In the Money Options and RSU Holder, in each case, on a pro-
rata basis (calculated based on the shares of Common Stock, In the Money
Options, and RSUs, held by each Stockholder, Optionholder of In the Money
Options and RSU Holder, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective
Time). For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate amount of Earn-Out
Consideration paid or payable for all Earn-Out Periods shall not exceed the
Maximum Earn-Out Amount. Any amount paid in respect of the Earn-Out
Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.5(g) shall be treated by the parties
as an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes, except to the extent
otherwise required by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the
Stockholders Representative acknowledge they may from time to time discuss
settling the amount and payment of the Earn-Out Consideration prior to any
Final Earn-Out Determination Date.

(h) Earn-Out Period Operations. Parent hereby covenants and agrees that,
during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2020, Parent (i) shall in good faith cause each of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to operate their respective businesses in the ordinary
course of business; (ii) shall maintain separate books and records with
respect to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the extent
necessary to calculate the Commercial Margin and (iii) shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, take or cause to be taken any action with the
intent to reduce the amount of Commercial Margin for purposes of calculating
the Earn-Out Consideration; provided that this Section 3.5(h) shall in no way
delay, prohibit or otherwise impact any integration, cost reduction or similar
matters undertaken or proposed to be undertaken by Parent and its Affiliates
after the Closing.

(i) Trigger Event. Upon the occurrence during any Earn-Out Period of any
direct or indirect transfer (whether by sale, merger, consolidation, share
exchange, recapitalization, liquidation or similar transaction, including a
sale of the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its Subsidiaries) to a
third party of all or a material portion of the consolidated assets of the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' North American business segment as described
in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (such
transfer, a "Trigger Event"), then as a condition to such Trigger Event, and
in order to prevent the dilution of the benefits or potential benefits
intended to inure to the Stockholders, Optionholders and RSU Holders in
respect of the Earn-Out Consideration, Parent shall pay the Earn-Out
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.5(g) concurrently with (but
expressly conditioned upon) the consummation of such Trigger Event, with the
Earn-Out Consideration being equal to the Maximum Earn-Out Amount minus any
Earn-Out Consideration previously paid at such time in respect of any prior
Earn-Out Period.

(j) Earn-Out Procedures Prior to Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties acknowledge and agree that an Earn-Out Period may end prior to the
Closing and, therefore, the procedures in this Section 3.5 shall need to be
adjusted in good faith by the parties to reflect 





that, among other things, Parent shall not be able to prepare the Proposed
Earn-Out Statement for such Earn-Out Period prior to the Closing. In such
circumstance and until the Closing occurs, (i) the provisions of this Section
3.5 which are applicable to Parent with respect to preparation of the Proposed
Earn-Out Statement and the dispute resolution procedures in this Section 3.5
shall instead apply to the Company and (ii) the provisions of this Section 3.5
which are applicable to the Stockholders Representative with respect to access
to the Company, review of the Proposed Earn-Out Statement and the dispute
resolution procedures in this Section 3.5 shall instead apply to Parent, in
each case, mutatis mutandis. In addition, Parent shall be under no obligation
whatsoever to pay any Earn-Out Consideration until the Closing and,
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.5(g), the parties agree that if
any Final Earn-Out Determination Date should occur prior to the Closing Date,
any Earn-Out Consideration that would otherwise have been payable in
accordance with Section 3.5(g) shall instead be paid at the Closing (subject
to reduction, offset or deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Account, in each case,
in accordance with Section 8.2(d)).

Section 3.6 Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a
Stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares (the "Dissenting Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Stockholders") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost its right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right, such holder's shares of Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive,
as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such
share, in accordance with Section 3.1, without interest. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice and a copy of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
Stockholders' rights of appraisal, and, at Parent's expense, Parent shall have
the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal by Stockholders under the DGCL, so long as
Parent does not create any pre-Closing obligations of the Company. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

Section 3.7 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amount otherwise payable under this Agreement any Tax required by Law to
be deducted and withheld therefrom, and shall timely remit such Tax to the
applicable Taxing Authority. Upon becoming aware of any such withholding
obligation, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, shall provide commercially reasonable notice to the
Person with respect to which such withholding obligation applies, and shall
reasonably cooperate with such Person to obtain any available reduction of or
relief from such deduction or withholding. Any Tax 





withheld and remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority in accordance with
this Section 3.7 shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such withholding was made.

Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational
documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.

SEC Filings; Internal Controls and Procedures. 

(a) Since January 1, 2016, the Company has filed with the SEC all forms,
reports, schedules, statements, certificates and other documents required to
be filed or furnished by it with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act") and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act") (all such forms, reports, schedules, statements,
certificates, and other documents filed or furnished by the Company since
January 1, 2016, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of the time of filing with
the SEC: (i) each of the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (as the case may be), and (ii) none of the Company SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The Company has made available to Parent correct and
complete copies of all SEC comments received from January 1, 2016 to the date
hereof and the Company's responses thereto. There are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in any comment letters from the staff of the SEC received
from January 1, 2016 to the date hereof by the Company relating to the Company
SEC Documents. As of the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Documents, to

procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The
Company\'s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide
reasonable assurances that all material information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company\'s management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\'s internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for the year ended December 31, 2014, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective. The Company has
disclosed to Parent (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the
Company\'s ability to report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Company\'s internal control over financial reporting,
in each case, that was disclosed to the Company\'s auditors or the audit
committee of the Company's Board of Directors in connection with its most
recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to the
date hereof.

Section 4.7 Financial Statements. The consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries contained in the Company SEC Documents have been
prepared in accordance 





with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods presented, except
as otherwise noted therein and subject, in the case of interim unaudited
financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments which were not and will
not be material, either individually or in the aggregate. Such consolidated
financial statements fairly present, in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and the results of their operations, their cash flow and changes in their
stockholders equity for the periods reflected therein, except as otherwise
noted therein and subject, in the case of interim unaudited financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments which will not be material, either
individually or in the aggregate. Such consolidated financial statements

Subsidiaries has any liabilities, obligations or commitments of a nature
(whether asserted or unasserted, known or unknown, absolute or contingent,

required to be reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet in
accordance with GAAP, other than (i) liabilities set forth on Schedule 4.8,

date of the Company Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax liabilities

Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto).

(d) No jurisdiction in which the Company and its Subsidiaries do not file Tax

acknowledge and agree that except for the representations and warranties
contained in Article IV (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules hereto),
neither the Company nor any other Person makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries or

Regulatory Approvals. 

(a) Parent and, where applicable, the Company shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as

practicable and advisable after the date of this Agreement (and with respect
to the HSR Act, no later than ten (10) Business Days from the date of this
Agreement), and any filing fees associated therewith shall be paid by the
Parent and such initial filings from Parent and the Company shall request
early termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii)
agree not to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Body not to consummate the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other party not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (iii)
subject to applicable Law, furnish to the other party as promptly as
reasonably practicable all information required for any application or other
filing to be made by the other party pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) respond

supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information or
documentation that may be requested by, the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the
European Commission ("Commission") or by any other Governmental Body in
respect of such Antitrust Filings, this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (v) promptly notify the other party in advance of any
material communication between that party and the FTC, the DOJ, the Commission
or any other Governmental Body in respect of any Antitrust Filings or
investigation, inquiry or other Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby and of any material or substantive
communication received or given in connection with any Proceeding by a private
party relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, (vi) subject to
applicable Law, discuss with and permit the other party to review in advance,
and consider in good faith the other party's reasonable comments in connection
with, any Antitrust Filing or communication to the FTC, the DOJ, the
Commission or any other Governmental Body or, in connection with any
Proceeding by a private party to any other Person, relating to any Antitrust
Filing or investigation, inquiry or other Proceeding relating to this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, (vii) not 





participate or agree to participate in any meeting, telephone call or
discussion with the FTC, the DOJ, the Commission or any other Governmental
Body in respect of any Antitrust Filing, investigation or inquiry relating to
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Body, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting, telephone call or discussion, (viii) subject to
applicable Law, furnish the other party promptly with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications between them and their Affiliates

with any Antitrust Filings and in connection with resolving any investigation
or other inquiry of any Governmental Body under the HSR Act, the EUMR or any
other Antitrust Law with respect to any such Antitrust Filing, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) resolve, avoid or eliminate impediments or
objections, if any, that may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or (ii) avoid the commencement of
any Proceeding or the entry of any Order that would prevent, prohibit,
restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, so
as to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated hereby
expeditiously and in any event prior to the End Date.

(c) If required to obtain approval from the applicable Governmental Body under
the Applicable Antitrust Laws, Parent shall propose, negotiate, commit to and
effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale,
divesture, disposition or license, and otherwise take or commit to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parent's or its Subsidiaries'
or Affiliates' freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or its
or their ability to retain, one or more of the assets, properties, businesses,
product lines, or services of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
interest or interests therein, or effective as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries (each a "Divestiture Action");
provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 6.4 or otherwise in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent be
required to take a Divestiture Action if such Divestiture Action, individually
or in the aggregate, would involve assets, properties, businesses, product
lines or services of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or effective as
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, that
generated net sales revenues, measured on an aggregate basis for all such
assets, properties, businesses, product lines or services, in excess of
$1,200,000,000 during the twelve (12) months ended December 31, 2017
(excluding from such calculation net sales revenue of any ancillary assets,
properties, businesses, product lines or services required to be made
available on a transitional basis necessary for the operation of, but not
required to be sold, divested, or disposed of in connection with, the assets,
properties, businesses, product lines or services sold pursuant to the
applicable Divestiture Action). The Company shall not take or agree to take
any Divestiture Action without the prior written request of Parent. In
addition, the Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, overturned or
terminated, any 





Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would restrain,
prevent, or delay the Closing prior to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including by pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing set forth in this
Section 6.4 or otherwise in this Agreement shall (i) require, or be construed
to require, Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
agree to a Divestiture Action unless such agreement or action shall be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or (ii) require, or be
construed to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries to take
any Divestiture Action involving assets, properties, businesses, product lines
or services of Parent or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries (other than,
effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries) in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to compliance with the provisions of
this Section 6.4, Parent shall have the right to determine, direct and have
control over the strategy and process by which the parties will seek required
approvals under the Antitrust Laws and to control the defense or prosecution
of any claims, actions or proceedings relating thereto, including all matters
relating to any Divestiture Actions.

(d) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with,
or by purchasing assets of or equity in, any Person or portion thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, other than such actions
taken in the Ordinary Course of Business, if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or
consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay beyond the
End Date in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any consent, approval, authorization, declaration, waiver, license,
franchise, permit, certificate or order of any Governmental Body necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period, in each case, the receipt,
expiration or termination of which is a condition to Closing pursuant to
Article VII, (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Body
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or (iii) delay beyond the End Date the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) The parties shall cooperate to submit a joint voluntary notice to CFIUS
with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. The parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to comply at the earliest practicable time, and in any
event no later than required by CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency, with any
request for additional information, documents or other materials, and will use
their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with
the CFIUS notice and in connection with resolving any investigation or other
inquiry of CFIUS or any CFIUS member agency. The parties shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly inform the other party of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, CFIUS
or any CFIUS member agency regarding any such filings, provided that no party
shall be required to share communications containing its confidential business
information if such confidential information is unrelated to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties shall undertake reasonable best
efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action, and do, or cause
to be done all things necessary or advisable to obtain CFIUS Clearance as soon
as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the End Date, including,
but not limited to, executing a letter 





of assurance or entering into another form of mitigation agreement with CFIUS
or CFIUS member agencies on terms, conditions, or measures sought by CFIUS,
provided however, that neither party shall be required to take or agree to
take any undertaking that is not conditioned on the consummation of the
Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent or its
Affiliates be obligated to execute any settlements, undertakings, consent
decrees, stipulations, or other agreements with CFIUS or CFIUS member agencies
that would (i) limit Parent's or its Affiliates' ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) require the sale,
divestiture, or other disposition of, one or more of the assets, properties,
product lines, or services or any interests therein of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case, that is material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), (iii) constrain the conduct of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) in a material and adverse
manner, (iv) remove (A) oversight, management and control by Parent or its
Affiliates, or (B) physical or other access by them to, assets, books and
records, businesses or operations of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, in the case of each of clauses (A) or (B), which are material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), or (v) require Parent or
its Affiliates to hold their ownership interests in the Surviving Corporation
through proxy holders or in a voting trust

(f) If CFIUS informs the parties orally or in writing that CFIUS has
recommended or intends to recommend in a report that the President of the
United States prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
may, at its discretion, withdraw the joint voluntary notice and the Company
shall cooperate with Parent in withdrawing the joint voluntary notice.
However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the parties hereby agree to
withdraw and refile the joint voluntary notice with CFIUS one (1) time if
CFIUS presents the parties with the option of doing so upon expiration of the
CFIUS investigation period. The parties shall cooperate and consider any
subsequent opportunities to withdraw and refile the joint voluntary notice
with CFIUS consistent with the terms of this Section 6.4.

anything in this Agreement (including Section 6.5(b) and Section 6.5(c)) to
the contrary, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (A) be

good faith determined that such representation, warranty or certification is

this Section 6.5(c) and in connection with the Debt Financing Documents to the
extent any such action could reasonably be expected to result in personal
liability of any kind to any such director, officer or employee.

Section 6.7

|

Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who
at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each,
an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the "Indemnitees") with respect to all
claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement) and expenses (including reasonable fees
and expenses of legal counsel) (collectively, "Losses") in connection with any
claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of
the Company), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in
part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director, officer or employee of
the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in
the Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plans)), in
each case under (A) 





or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim,
suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted
by Law and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to
the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided
in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the
organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as currently in effect. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and the Surviving Corporation to,
pay any expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) of
any Indemnitee under this Section 6.7 (including in connection with enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 6.7)
reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with investigating or
defending any such to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; provided, however,
that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected
without the Surviving Corporation's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(b) Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and control
the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or
omissions covered under this Section 6.7 (each, a "Claim") with counsel
selected by Parent, which shall be reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee;
provided, however, that Indemnitee shall be permitted to participate in the
defense of such Claim at its own expense. Each of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of
any Claim and shall provide access to properties (including the Real Property)
and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

(c) For the six (6)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any additional
persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms and scope with
respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (provided
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may (i) substitute therefor policies,
issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) obtain as of the
Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time). In no event will Parent or the
Surviving 





Corporation be required to expend for each covered year an amount in excess of
300% of the current annual premium for such insurance (the "Maximum Premium").
If such insurance coverage is terminated, cancelled, cannot be obtained at
all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation will maintain such insurance as can be
obtained for the remainder of the six-year period for a premium not in excess
of the Maximum Premium. True and complete copies of current and effective
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies have been provided to
Parent.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this
Section 6.7 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing
to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.7).

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,

set forth in this Section 6.7.

Parent, as applicable, public disclosure is otherwise required by applicable
Law (including applicable securities Laws) or by the applicable rules of any
stock exchange on which Parent lists securities, provided that, to the extent
required by applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use

Section 6.9

Employment and Employee Benefits. 

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to
provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company
Employees") for the period of twelve (12) months immediately following the
Closing Date, (i) at least the same level of base salary and hourly wages as
in effect on the Closing Date, and (ii) benefits that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits provided by the Company and its
Affiliates to Company Employees prior to the Closing Date; provided, however,
that no defined benefit pension, post-retirement 





medical, equity-based, retention, change-in-control or other special or non-
recurring compensation or benefits provided prior to the Closing Date shall be
taken into account for purposes of this covenant. From and after the Closing
Date, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall honor, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms, all
employment, retention and severance agreements and all severance, incentive
and bonus plans, programs and arrangements as in effect on the Closing Date
that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the
Company, subject to the terms and conditions, including the amendment and
termination provisions, thereof. Parent or one of its Affiliates shall
recognize the service of the Company Employees with the Company and its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent and its Affiliates
in connection with any pension or welfare benefit plans and policies
(including vacations, paid time-off, and holiday policies) maintained by
Parent or one of its Affiliates (each, a "Parent Plan") which is made
available following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its Affiliates for
purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility, benefit entitlement and
benefit accrual, provided that service credit shall not be required with
respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan, or to the
extent that service credit would result in a duplication of benefits. Parent
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, to the extent commercially and
administratively practicable, (i) waive, or cause its insurance carriers to
waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company
Employees under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)
which is made available to Company Employees following the Closing Date by
Parent or one of its Affiliates, and (ii) provide credit to Company Employees
for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such
employees under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries during the portion of the relevant plan year
including the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.9 to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any Parent Plan or Company Benefit Plan, or shall
limit the right of Parent or one of its Affiliates or the Surviving
Corporation to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Parent Plan or Company
Benefit Plan following the Effective Time. If (i) a party other than the
parties hereto makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in
this Agreement as an amendment to any Parent Plan or Company Benefit Plan, and
(ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such plan even though not
explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then, solely with respect to
such plan, such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no
amendatory effect with respect thereto.

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 6.9 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and
that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any
third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including,
without limitation, any current or former employees or directors of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or
any Parent Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued
employment with Parent or any of its Affiliates or to any particular term or
condition of employment. 





Section 6.10 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting any party's
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand that (i)
nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other party\'s operations
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, each of the
Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete and independent control and supervision over its
operations.

Section 6.11 Takeover Statutes. If any "moratorium", "control share
acquisition", "fair price", "supermajority", "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and their respective
boards, shall cooperate and grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.12 Exchangeable Notes. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall,
or shall cause Aleris International, Inc. to, (i) issue a notice of
conditional redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount
of the Exchangeable Notes (other than such notes that are surrendered for
exchange prior to the Closing), pursuant to the Exchangeable Notes Indenture,
(ii) issue all notices required to be issued by the Exchangeable Notes
Indenture in connection with the consummation of the Merger relating to the
exchange of the Exchangeable Notes for shares of Common Stock prior to the

permit any of its Affiliates or any of its or their representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or
continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person
concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements
or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause all of
its and their representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated,
all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes
hereof, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) concerning (i) a
merger, consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange or other
business combination transaction involving the Company; (ii) the issuance,
acquisition or sale of shares of capital stock or other equity securities of
the Company; or (iii) the sale, lease, exchange 





or other disposition of any significant portion of the Company\'s properties
or assets, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.15 Parent Vote and Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this

cause to be executed and delivered a written consent of the sole member of
Merger Sub approving this Agreement in accordance with the DLLCA, and provide
a copy of such written consent to the Company.

delivered the Stockholder Consent and is entitled to such notice under the
DGCL, which notice will include an information statement, describing in all

of record of capital stock of the adoption and approval of this Agreement by
the Board of Directors of the Company and the Company's receipt of the
Stockholder Consent.

event within 15 Business Days of the date hereof, provide evidence that the
Drag Notice (a) has been issued by the Majority Stockholders in accordance
with the terms of the Stockholders Agreement and (b) requires the Stockholders
to vote in favor of or deliver consents with respect to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby and waive any dissenter's rights, appraisal
rights or similar rights in accordance with the Stockholders Agreement. The
Company shall, and, if applicable, shall cause the Majority Stockholders to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) solicit the consent of each
Stockholder to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) cause each
Stockholder to waive any dissenter's rights, appraisal rights or similar
rights with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii)
otherwise enforce the provisions set forth in Article III of the Stockholders
Agreement with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

Business Days prior to the Closing Date), solicit from each "disqualified
individual" with respect to the Company (within the meaning of Section 280G(c)
of the Code) who may receive any payments or benefits that would constitute a
"parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code),
a waiver of such disqualified individual's rights to some or all of such
payments or benefits (the "Waived 280G Benefits") so that all remaining
payments and/or benefits, if any, shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), and to accept in
substitution for the Waived 280G Benefits the right to receive such remaining
payment or benefit only if approved by the stockholders of the Company in a
manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, with each such
waiver identifying the specific Waived 280G Benefits and providing that if
such stockholder approval is not obtained, such payments shall not be made and
such disqualified individual shall have no right or entitlement with respect
thereto, and (b) as soon as practicable after the date hereof (but in no event
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) submit 





to a stockholder vote (along with adequate disclosure satisfying the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder) the right of any such "disqualified individual" to
receive the Waived 280G Benefits. Prior to soliciting such waivers and
approval, the Company shall provide the determination of which payments may be
deemed to constitute parachute payments and the drafts of such waivers and
approval materials to Parent for its reasonable review and comment no later
than seven (7) Business Days prior to soliciting such waivers and soliciting
such approval. If any of the Waived 280G Benefits fail to be approved as
contemplated above, such Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided.

reasonably acceptable to Parent that a vote of the stockholders of the Company
was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.18
and that either (i) the requisite number of votes of the Stockholders of the
Company was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the "280G
Approval") or (ii) the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence,

Indemnification. 

(a) On the Closing Date, Parent, the Stockholders Representative and the
Company shall enter into an escrow agreement, in a form to be mutually agreed
(acting in a reasonable manner), with the Escrow Agent, effective as of the
Closing Date (the "Escrow Agreement"). Any amounts required to be deposited by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(d) shall be held in an account (the "Indemnity
Escrow Account") administered by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. All costs, fees, charges and expenses assessed by the Escrow
Agent to maintain the Indemnity Escrow Account as required hereunder, and any
and all penalties, obligations and liabilities associated therewith or arising
therefrom, shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 8.2, Parent and its
Affiliates and their respective representatives and permitted assigns (each, a
"Parent Indemnitee") shall be indemnified against any Identified Losses (as
defined in Schedule 8.2(b)) required to be paid by the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a final resolution with the relevant
Governmental Body (a "Resolution") of any or all of the matters described in
Schedule 8.2(b) (the "Indemnifiable Matters"). The right of the Parent
Indemnitees to indemnification for Identified Losses shall be satisfied solely
by: (i) disbursements from the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to Section
8.2(f) and (ii) reductions in the Earn-Out Consideration pursuant to Section
8.2(d).

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary:

(i) Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) for any Identified Losses unless and until the aggregate amount
of Identified Losses exceeds the Deductible, after which Parent Indemnitees
shall be indemnified only to the extent of such excess (such excess, the
"Indemnifiable Losses"); and 





(ii) in no event shall Parent Indemnitees be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2(b) for any Indemnifiable Losses in excess of EUR
8,541,000 (the "Indemnity Cap").

(d) At any time Earn-Out Consideration is required to be paid pursuant to
Section 3.5(g), Parent shall (without duplication):

(i) if there has been a Resolution of any of the Indemnifiable Matters prior
to such time that resulted in Indemnifiable Losses and for which the Parent
Indemnitees have not been and will not be indemnified in full through
disbursements from the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to Section 8.2(f)(i),
reduce the amount of such Earn-Out Consideration by the amount of such
Indemnifiable Losses (up to an amount equal to the Indemnity Cap less any
reductions or deposits previously made pursuant to this Section 8.2(d)); and

(ii) if there has not been a Resolution of all of the Indemnifiable Matters
prior to such time, deposit or cause to be deposited in the Indemnity Escrow
Account at such time (and such Earn-Out Consideration shall be reduced by) an
amount equal to the lesser of (x) such Earn-Out Consideration and (y) an
amount equal to the Indemnity Cap less any reductions or deposits previously
made pursuant to this Section 8.2(d) or any reductions concurrently made
pursuant to Section 8.2(d)(i);

provided, that the aggregate amount of reductions and deposits pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall in no event exceed the Indemnity Cap; and
at the time that such aggregate amount is equal to the Indemnity Cap, any
further Earn-Out Consideration shall be paid to the Paying Agent and the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 3.5(g).

(e) The Surviving Corporation shall manage the Indemnifiable Matters in
accordance with past practice and use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any Indemnifiable Losses, and shall:

(i) notify the Stockholders Representative of any substantive communications
received from any Governmental Body, court or other tribunal relating to the
Indemnifiable Matters within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of such
communications;

(ii) provide the Stockholders Representative with a copy of any substantive
written or electronic communications or documents received from any
Governmental Body, court or other tribunal relating to any Indemnifiable
Matter within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of such written or
electronic communications or documents;

(iii) retain and maintain all books and records, annexes, software, data, work
papers and other documents and information relating to any Indemnifiable
Matter until a Resolution of the Indemnifiable Matters occurs;

(iv) to the extent reasonably requested by the Stockholders Representative,
promptly provide the Stockholders Representative (or any advisor thereto) with
reasonable cooperation and access to any documents or information relating to
any Indemnifiable 





Matter, including by making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide explanation of documents or information relating to any
Indemnifiable Matter;

(v) consult with the Stockholders Representative prior to making any material
or strategic decisions relating to any Indemnifiable Matter; and

(vi) refrain from settling or compromising any Indemnifiable Matter without
the Stockholders Representative's prior written consent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(f) Within fifteen (15) Business Days following a Resolution that occurs after
any amount has been deposited into the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall provide a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement,
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Indemnity Escrow Account (i)
to the applicable Parent Indemnitee an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the
Indemnifiable Losses resulting from such Resolution to which such Parent
Indemnitee is entitled pursuant to this Section 8.2 (less any prior
disbursements in respect of the Indemnifiable Matters pursuant to the next
sentence) and (y) the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Account, and then (ii)
only if all of the Indemnifiable Matters have been subject to Resolution, (A)
to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Stockholders and (B) to
the Surviving Corporation for payroll processing and distribution at the next
administratively practicable payroll date to each Optionholder of In the Money
Options and RSU Holder, in each case, on a pro-rata basis (calculated based on
the shares of Common Stock, In the Money Options, and RSUs, held by each
Stockholder, Optionholder of In the Money Options and RSU Holder, as
applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time) any funds remaining in
the Indemnity Escrow Account after the disbursement to the applicable Parent
Indemnitee. For the avoidance of doubt, if certain portions or aspects of the
Indemnifiable Matters are finally resolved prior to the complete Resolution of
all Indemnifiable Matters, then the amount of Indemnifiable Losses resulting
from such Resolution shall be disbursed from the applicable Indemnity Escrow
Account to Parent within fifteen (15) Business Days following such resolution.

(g) The Parent Indemnitees (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) shall take all actions set forth in Schedule 8.2(g).

(h) For Tax purposes, (i) any disbursements from the Indemnity Escrow Account
to the Stockholders (by way of the Paying Agent), and (ii) any reduction in
the amount of the Earn-Out Consideration pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be
treated as adjustments to the purchase price, except to the extent otherwise
required by Law.

7.2(b), and (B) by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if
such breach or failure is capable of being cured by the End Date, Parent or

forthwith be given to the other party, and this Agreement shall terminate, and
the Merger contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, without further action by

pursuant to Section 9.2, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect

other party hereto, except: (i) that no such termination shall relieve Parent
of any liability of Parent under Section 9.5 of this Agreement, including
payment of Parent Termination Fee One or Parent Termination Fee Two and other
amounts if payable pursuant to Section 9.5; (ii) the provisions of Section
6.8, this Section 9.4, Section 9.5, Article X and Article I hereof and the

termination; and (iii) that, subject to Section 9.5(e), no such termination
shall relieve any party of any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by
the other party, to the extent such liabilities or damages were the result of
fraud, intentional or willful breach of any provisions hereof.

Termination Fees and Expenses. 

(a) In the event that:

(i) (A) one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(c) or Section
7.1(d) has not been satisfied, in each case, as a result of (x) an Order of a
Governmental Body issued with respect to an Applicable Antitrust Law or (y) a
failure to obtain the approvals of the applicable 





Governmental Bodies, or a failure of any applicable waiting periods to have
expired or terminated, in each case, as required under the Applicable
Antitrust Laws by the End Date, (B) all of the other conditions set forth in
Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.1(c) (excluding any Order by a Governmental Body
with respect to the Applicable Antitrust Laws, any other Antitrust Law or
CFIUS) and 7.1(e) have been satisfied (other than the conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but which conditions would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of termination of this Agreement)
and (C) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant
to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(c); or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.2(e) or
Section 9.2(f);

then, in each case, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company or
its designee an amount equal to $150,000,000 ("Parent Termination Fee One") as
promptly as possible (but in any event within two (2) Business Days after such
termination), by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(b) In the event that (A) one or more of the conditions set forth in Section
7.1(c) or Section 7.1(d) has not been satisfied, in each case, as a result of
(x) an Order of a Governmental Body issued with respect to an Antitrust Law
(other than the Applicable Antitrust Laws), (y) a failure to obtain the
approvals of the applicable Governmental Bodies, or a failure of any
applicable waiting periods to have expired or terminated, in each case, as
required under the Antitrust Laws (other than the Applicable Antitrust Laws)
by the End Date, or (z) a Deemed CFIUS Order or a failure to obtain CFIUS
Clearance by the End Date, (B) all of the other conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 have been satisfied (other than the conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing but which conditions would be satisfied if
the Closing Date were the date of termination of this Agreement) and (C) this
Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
9.2(a) or Section 9.2(c), then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Company or its designee an amount equal to $25,000,000 ("Parent Termination
Fee Two") as promptly as possible (but in any event within two (2) Business
Days after such termination), by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(c) In the event that Parent fails to pay either Parent Termination Fee One or
Parent Termination Fee Two, as applicable, when due and in accordance with the
requirements of this Agreement, Parent shall reimburse the Company for costs
and expenses actually incurred or accrued by the Company (including fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement
of this Section 9.5, together with interest on such unpaid Parent Termination
Fee One or Parent Termination Fee Two, as applicable, commencing on the date
that Parent Termination Fee One or Parent Termination Fee Two, as applicable,
became due, at a rate equal to three percent (3%) per annum. Such collection
expenses shall not otherwise diminish in any way the payment obligations
hereunder.

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 9.5 are an integral part of the
transaction contemplated hereby, (ii) the damages resulting from termination
of this Agreement under circumstances where Parent Termination Fee One or
Parent Termination Fee Two is payable are uncertain and incapable of 





accurate calculation and, therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section
9.5(a) or Section 9.5(b), as applicable, are not a penalty but rather
constitute amounts akin to liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, and
(iii) without the agreements contained in this Section 9.5, the parties hereto
would not have entered into this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.2 in circumstances in
which either Parent Termination Fee One or Parent Termination Fee Two are
payable pursuant to this Section 9.5, then the Company's receipt of Parent
Termination Fee One or Parent Termination Fee Two, as applicable, pursuant to
the preceding clauses (a) and (b), and the payment of any amounts due pursuant
to the preceding clause (c), shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
of the Company against (1) Parent and Merger Sub; (2) the former, current and
future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company
interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, assignees of any Person named in clause (1); and (3) any future
holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
assignees of any of the foregoing for any claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement) and expenses arising under or in connection with this Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or breach or failure to
perform hereunder or in any other agreement contemplated hereby or alleged to
have been made in connection herewith or otherwise. In the event that both
Parent Termination Fee One and Parent Termination Fee Two are payable pursuant
to this Section 9.5, then Parent shall be obligated only to pay Parent
Termination Fee One and shall not be obligated to pay Parent Termination Fee
Two. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will (i) the
Company be entitled to receive, nor will Parent be required to pay, both
Parent Termination Fee One and Parent Termination Fee Two or (ii) any
provision of this Section 9.5(e) limit or prevent the Company's right to seek
equitable relief pursuant to Section 10.11.

ARTICLE X.

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 10.1 Expenses. Each party to this Agreement shall bear its respective
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including legal, accounting, financial advisor and other
professional fees). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall be solely
responsible for and shall pay all of the filing fees required pursuant to the
HSR Act and in connection with any other Antitrust Filings and filings to
obtain CFIUS Clearance.

Section 10.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the schedules and
exhibits hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, and each other agreement,
document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby or to be executed in
connection with the transactions contemplated 





hereby, represent the entire understanding and agreement between the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede
all prior agreements among the parties respecting the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define
their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the other agreements, documents, instruments
and certificates contemplated hereby, and the parties hereto expressly
disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not
expressly set forth in this Agreement or any of the agreements, documents,
instruments or certificates contemplated hereby.

Section 10.3 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the
party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification
or waiver is sought; provided, however, that after receipt of the Stockholder
Consent, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law require
further approval of the Stockholders, the effectiveness of such amendment or
waiver shall be subject to the approval of the Stockholders. No action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action
of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing
waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.

Section 10.4 Governing Law. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement, including all claims
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including any claim or
cause of action based upon, arising out of, or relating to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement
to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 10.5 Jurisdiction and Venue. Any litigation against any party to this
Agreement arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement shall be
brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (unless
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, in which case, in any state or federal court within
the State of Delaware) (together with the appellate courts thereof, the
"Chosen Courts") and each of the parties hereby submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for the purpose of any such litigation. Each
party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert (a) any objection
which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such litigation in any
Chosen Court, (b) any claim that any such litigation brought in any Chosen
Court has been brought in an inconvenient 





forum and (c) any claim that any Chosen Court does not have jurisdiction with
respect to such litigation. To the extent that service of process by mail is
permitted by applicable Law, each party irrevocably consents to the service of
process in any such litigation in such courts by the mailing of such process
by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address for notices
provided for herein.

Section 10.6 Notices. All notices and other communications under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered
personally by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when sent by
facsimile (with written confirmation of transmission) or (iii) one (1)
Business Day following the day sent by overnight courier (with written
confirmation of receipt), in each case at the following addresses and

have specified by notice given to the other party pursuant to this provision):

Section 10.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 10.8 Binding Effect; Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as contemplated by
Section 3.1 (with respect to the Stockholders' right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration) and Section 3.4 (with respect to the Optionholders'
right to receive the Option Cancellation Amount and the RSU Holders' right to
receive the RSU Payment Amount), nothing in this Agreement shall create or be
deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity
not a party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, subject to the provisions of Section 6.9(c), the Company shall have
the right to enforce the rights of the Stockholders, the Optionholders and the
RSU Holders to pursue damages in the event of Parent's or Merger Sub's willful
and material breach of this Agreement. In addition, the Company shall have the
right, but not the obligation to enforce any rights of the Stockholders, the
Optionholders and the RSU Holders under this Agreement. No assignment of this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any party,
directly or indirectly (by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment
without the required consents shall be void, except that Parent or Merger Sub
may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in
whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of their Affiliates at any
time (provided that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or
Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter, or change any
obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Sub).

Section 10.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

Section 10.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by
jury in respect of any Proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under
or in connection with this Agreement, any Company Documents, or any
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party hereto (i) certifies
that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) 





acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Company Documents, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.10.

Section 10.11 Performance. The parties agree that Parent and Merger Sub would
suffer irreparable damage in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages or legal remedies, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Therefore, it is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies, each party shall
be entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by any
other party and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other party, and
appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection
therewith. Each of the parties hereto hereby waive: (i) any defenses in any
action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate; and (ii) any requirement to post a bond or other security
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

Section 10.12 Stockholders Representative.

(a) The Stockholders Representative shall be the agent and attorney-in-fact
for each of the Stockholders, the RSU Holders and the Optionholders under this
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms of this Section 10.12. In the event of the resignation, death or
incapacity of the Stockholders Representative, a successor Stockholders
Representative reasonably satisfactory to Parent shall thereafter be appointed
by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and such successor Stockholders
Representative.

(b) The Stockholders Representative is hereby authorized and empowered to act
for, and on behalf of, any or all of the Stockholders, the RSU Holders and the
Optionholders (with full power of substitution in the premises) in connection
with such matters as are reasonably necessary for the consummation and
administration of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby, including
executing and delivering all agreements, amendments, certificates, receipts,
consents, elections, instructions and other documents contemplated by, or
deemed by the Stockholders Representative to be necessary or desirable in
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the other agreements
contemplated hereby and thereby and the transactions contemplated herein or
therein. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on such appointment
and to treat the Stockholders Representative as the duly appointed attorney-
in-fact of each Stockholder, RSU Holder and Optionholder. Notices given to the
Stockholders Representative in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement shall constitute notice to the Stockholders, RSU Holders and the
Optionholders for all purposes under this Agreement.

(c) The appointment of the Stockholders Representative is an agency coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable and any action taken by the Stockholders
Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this Section 10.12 shall
be effective and absolutely binding on each Stockholder, RSU Holder and
Optionholder notwithstanding any contrary action of or direction 





from such Stockholder, RSU Holder or Optionholder, except for actions or
omissions of the Stockholders Representative constituting willful misconduct
or gross negligence. The death or incapacity, or dissolution or other
termination of existence, of any Stockholder, RSU Holder or Optionholder shall
not terminate the authority and agency of the Stockholders Representative.
Parent, Merger Sub and any other party to any document contemplated by this
Agreement in dealing with the Stockholders Representative may conclusively and
absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any act of the Stockholders
Representative as the act of the Stockholder, RSU Holder or Optionholder.

(d) The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder,
RSU Holder, Optionholder or to any other Person (other than Parent or Merger
Sub), with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Stockholders Representative in its role as Stockholders Representative under
or in connection with this Agreement, unless such action or omission results
from or arises out of willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of
the Stockholders Representative, and the Stockholders Representative shall not
be liable to any Stockholder, RSU Holder or Optionholder in the event that, in
the exercise of his or its reasonable judgment, the Stockholders
Representative believes there will not be adequate resources available to
cover potential costs and expenses to contest a claim made by Parent or Merger
Sub.

(e) The Stockholders Representative may act pursuant to the advice of counsel
with respect to any matter relating to this Agreement and shall not be liable
for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such
advice. The Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any
Order, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to
it hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the
correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the
service thereof. The Stockholders Representative may act in reliance upon any
instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the
Person purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or execute
any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized
to do so. The Stockholders Representative may conclusively presume that the
undersigned representative of any party hereto which is an entity other than a
natural person has full power and authority to instruct the Stockholders
Representative on behalf of that party unless written notice to the contrary
is delivered to the Stockholders Representative.

(f) Upon any disbursement of amounts from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the
Stockholders, the Optionholders and the RSU Holders or the payment of any
Earn-Out Consideration to Stockholders, the Optionholders and the RSU Holders,
the Stockholders Representative shall receive reimbursement from, and be
indemnified from, the Earn-Out Consideration or the amounts disbursed from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable, for any and all expenses, charges and
liabilities, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the
Stockholders Representative in the performance or discharge of its duties
pursuant to this Section 10.12.
