           (a) On or around the tenth Business Day preceding the Closing Date,
Seller shall in good faith estimate the Adjusted Working Capital as of the last
calendar day of the immediately preceding calendar month (the "Seller's
Estimated Adjusted Working Capital") and deliver to Purchaser in accordance with
Section 12.4 a notice specifying Seller's Estimated Adjusted Working Capital and
the basis, in reasonable detail, for such calculation. Purchaser shall have
seven (7) Business Days to review Seller's Estimated Adjusted Working Capital
during which time Seller shall in good faith assist Purchaser in such review.
After such seven Business Day review period shall have terminated, either (i)
the parties shall have, acting in good faith, mutually agreed on an estimate of
the Adjusted Working Capital as of the last calendar day of such immediately
preceding month (the "Agreed Estimated Adjusted Working Capital") or (ii)
Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall have, acting in
good faith, each determined an estimate of the Adjusted Working Capital as of
the last calendar day of such immediately preceding month (the determination
closest to the amount of $38,000,000 being hereinafter referred to as the
"Default Estimated Adjusted Working Capital").

                                      -22-
<PAGE>   28
           (b) Following the determination of the Agreed Estimated Adjusted
Working Capital or the Default Estimated Adjusted Working Capital, as the case
may be, the Closing Payment shall be adjusted as follows:

                      (i) in the event the Agreed Estimated Adjusted Working
           Capital or the Default Estimated Adjusted Working Capital, as the
           case may be, exceeds the amount of $33,500,000, then the Closing
           Payment shall be adjusted upward by an amount equal to such excess;
           and

                      (ii) in the event that the Agreed Estimated Adjusted
           Working Capital or the Default Estimated Adjusted Working Capital, as
           the case may be, is less than the amount of $33,500,000, then the
           Closing Payment shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to such
           shortfall.

     2.5   Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price
shall be subject to further adjustment after the Closing as specified in this
Section 2.5:

           (a) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60)
calendar days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller the
Closing Balance Sheet, together with a certificate of Purchaser certifying that
the Closing Balance Sheet was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
basis consistent with the preparation of the Reference Balance Sheet.

           (b) Subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.5(b), the Closing
Balance Sheet delivered by Purchaser to Seller shall be deemed to be and shall
be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.

                      (i) Seller may dispute any amounts reflected on the
           Closing Balance Sheet to the extent the net effect of such disputed
           amounts in the aggregate would affect the Adjusted Working Capital
           but only on the basis that the amounts reflected on the Closing
           Balance Sheet were not prepared in accordance with the same GAAP
           applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Reference
           Balance Sheet; provided, however, that Seller shall have notified
           Purchaser in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount
           thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the

                                      -23-
<PAGE>   29
           basis for such dispute, within thirty (30) calendar days of
           Purchaser's delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet to Seller, and
           provided, further, if during the thirty (30) day period specified in
           the preceding proviso Seller shall request access to the work papers
           of Purchaser relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance
           Sheet, Purchaser shall provide such work papers to Seller within ten
           (10) days following Seller's request therefor, and in such event the
           running of the thirty (30) day period within which Seller may notify
           Purchaser in writing of items contained in the Closing Balance Sheet
           that Seller disputes shall be suspended from the date of Seller's
           request for access to Purchaser's work papers until the date on which
           all such requested work papers have been provided. In the event of
           such a dispute, Seller's Accountants and Purchaser's Accountants
           shall attempt to reconcile the differences, and any resolution by
           them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and
           conclusive on the parties hereto. If Seller's Accountants and
           Purchaser's Accountants are unable to reach a resolution with such
           effect within ten (10) calendar days after receipt by Purchaser of
           Seller's written notice of dispute, Seller's Accountants and
           Purchaser's Accountants shall submit the items remaining in dispute
           for resolution to a "Big Five" independent accounting firm other than
           Seller's Accountants or Purchaser's Accountants mutually acceptable
           to Purchaser and Seller (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), which
           shall, within thirty (30) calendar days after such submission,
           determine and report to Purchaser and Seller upon such remaining
           disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and
           conclusive on Seller and Purchaser. The fees and disbursements of the
           Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Seller and
           Purchaser in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such
           remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting
           Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
           determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total
           amount of such disputed items so submitted.

                      (ii) In acting under this Agreement, Purchaser's
           Accountants, Seller's Accountants and the Independent Accounting Firm
           shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

                                      -24-
<PAGE>   30
           (c) The Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed final for the purposes
of this Section 2.5 upon the earlier of (1) the failure of the Seller timely to
notify Purchaser of a dispute, (2) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to
Section 2.5(b)(ii), by Purchaser's Accountants and Seller's Accountants, and (3)
the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii), by the
Independent Accounting Firm. Within three (3) Business Days of the Closing
Balance Sheet being deemed final, a Purchase Price adjustment shall be made as
follows:

                      (i) In the event that the Agreed Estimated Adjusted
           Working Capital or the Default Estimated Adjusted Working Capital, as
           the case may be, exceeds the Adjusted Working Capital reflected on
           the final Closing Balance Sheet, then the Purchase Price shall be
           adjusted downward in an amount equal to the full amount by which such
           Agreed Estimated Adjusted Working Capital or Default Estimated
           Adjusted Working Capital, as the case may be, exceeds the Adjusted
           Working Capital shown on the final Closing Balance Sheet. Purchaser
           shall deliver written notice to Seller specifying the amount of such
           downward adjustment of the Purchase Price, and Seller shall, within
           three (3) Business Days of receipt of such notice, pay such amount to
           Purchaser in immediately available funds.

                      (ii) In the event that the Adjusted Working Capital
           reflected on the final Closing Balance Sheet exceeds the Agreed
           Estimated Adjusted Working Capital or the Default Estimated Adjusted
           Working Capital, as the case may be, then the Purchase Price shall be
           adjusted upward in an amount equal to the full amount by which the
           Adjusted Working Capital shown on the final Closing Balance Sheet
           exceeds such Agreed Estimated Adjusted Working Capital or Default
           Estimated Adjusted Working Capital, as the case may be, and Purchaser
           shall, within three Business Days of such determination, pay the
           amount of such excess to Seller by wire transfer in immediately
           available funds.

     2.6   Contingent Consideration. In addition to the consideration set
forth in Sections 2.1 and 2.7 hereof, for the twelve-month period commencing on
the day immediately following the Closing Date and running through the first
anniversary of the Closing, and thereafter for each twelve-month period through
the seventh anniversary of the Closing (each

                                      -25-
<PAGE>   31
such twelve-month period, a "Contingent Consideration Pay Period"), Seller shall
be entitled to receive from Purchaser, subject to the provisions of this Section
2.6, an additional cash payment calculated in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 2.6 (the "Contingent Consideration").


           (a) The Contingent Consideration for a particular Contingent
Consideration Pay Period shall be calculated by multiplying the nominal annual
production capacity, in metric tons, of the Plant, as specified below, by a rate
to be determined based upon the average LME Aluminum High Grade Cash Settlement
Quotation, per metric ton (the "Settlement Quotation"), as published in Platt's
Metals Week for the applicable Contingent Consideration Pay Period (the
"Contingent Consideration Rate"), as set forth below:

                      (i) during the first and second Contingent Consideration
           Pay Periods, the Contingent Consideration Rate shall be determined in
           accordance with Part I of Schedule 2.6(a); and

                      (ii) during the third through the seventh Contingent
           Consideration Pay Periods, the Contingent Consideration Rate shall be
           determined in accordance with the Part II of Schedule 2.6(a);

provided, however, that the total amount of Contingent Consideration payable
pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall not exceed Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000)
in the aggregate. In the event that Platt's Metals Week shall cease reporting
the Settlement Quotation or shall no longer be in general use in the industry as
a benchmark for the actual pricing of sales of aluminum, then Seller and
Purchaser shall agree on a suitable substitute indicator for determining the
market price of aluminum. For purposes of this Section 2.6, the nominal
production capacity of the Plant shall be two hundred thirty-five thousand
(235,000) metric tons per annum.

           (b) Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller the Contingent
Consideration due, if any, under this Section 2.6 within thirty (30) calendar
days after the close of the Contingent Consideration Pay Period with respect to
which such Contingent Consideration is due. Such payment shall be made in each
case by bank draft, certified check or wire transfer.

                                       26
<PAGE>   32


              2.7 Assumption of Debt. As further consideration for the sale and
transfer of the Shares and Additional Assets being effected hereby, at Closing,
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser designated by Purchaser shall assume the
obligations of Seller or Seller's Affiliate with respect to the Assumed
Indebtedness and the Assumed Liabilities. In connection with such assumption,
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser designated by Purchaser and Seller or
Seller's Affiliates, as applicable, shall enter into an assignment and
assumption agreement, in form and substance acceptable to Purchaser and Seller,
on and as of the Closing Date.

       2A. TRANSACTIONS PRIOR TO CLOSING


       2A.1 Partial Redemption of Shares. . Prior to the Closing, Southwire
shall cause Metalsco to redeem one hundred twenty (120) shares, subject to
adjustment, of the outstanding capital stock of Metalsco (the "Redeemed
Shares"), such that after such redemption and on the Closing Date the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Metalsco shall consist of eight hundred eighty
(880) shares, subject to adjustment, all of which shall constitute the Shares
for all purposes hereunder. In consideration for the redemption of the Redeemed
Shares, Metalsco shall (a) surrender and return to Southwire that certain
promissory note of Southwire issued and delivered in payment for certain assets
of Metalsco heretofore purchased by Southwire (the "Note"), which Note shall be
marked "Paid In Full and Satisfied," (b) transfer and assign to Southwire one
thousand (1,000) shares of the capital stock of Forte Power Systems, Inc.
("Forte"), which shares constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of that company, and (iii) transfer and assign to Southwire all Unwanted
Property. Southwire shall tender certificates representing the Redeemed Shares
to Metalsco for cancellation on the records of Metalsco against delivery of the
Note marked "Paid in Full" and delivery by Metalsco of instruments of transfer
for the shares of Forte and the Unwanted Property.

              3.12 Real Estate Matters.

                     (a) The Real Property constitutes all of the real property
(other than the Closed Potliner Disposal Areas), including buildings,
improvements and fixtures, owned or otherwise held by any of Seller, Metalsco,
Skyliner or NSA and utilized in the conduct of the Business as conducted
presently and as of December 31, 1999 and Metalsco, Skyliner and NSA neither
lease nor own any other real property.

                     (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.12(b), there is no
material violation of any Legal Requirement (including, without limitation, any
building, planning or zoning Legal Requirement) relating to any of the Real
Property or the Closed Potliner Disposal Areas. Seller has made available to
Purchaser true and correct copies of each deed for each parcel of Real Property
and all the title insurance policies, if any, title reports, surveys,
certificates of occupancy, environmental reports and audits, appraisals,
Permits, other title documents and other documents in the possession of the
Seller or its Affiliates relating to or otherwise affecting the Real Property.
Each of Seller, Metalsco, Skyliner or NSA, as the case may be, is in peaceful
and undisturbed possession of each of its parcels of Real Property and the
Closed Potliner Disposal Areas and there are no contractual or legal
restrictions that preclude or restrict the ability to use the premises for the
purposes for which they are currently being used. All existing water, sewer,
steam, gas, electricity, telephone and other utilities required for the
construction, use, occupancy, operation and maintenance of the Real Property are
adequate for the conduct of the Business as it has been and currently is
conducted. There are no material latent defects or material adverse physical
conditions affecting any of the Real Property or any of the facilities,
buildings, structures, erections, improvements, fixtures, fixed assets and
personalty of a permanent nature annexed, affixed or attached to, located on or
forming part of the Real Property. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.12(b), no
portion of the Real Property has been leased or subleased to any other Person.

                     (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.12(c), all the Real
Property is occupied under a valid and current certificate of occupancy or
similar permit (if one is required), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not require the issuance of any new or amended certificate of
occupancy and, to the Knowledge of Seller, Metalsco, Skyliner and NSA

                                      -40-
<PAGE>   46
after due inquiry, there are no facts that would prevent any of the Real
Property from being occupied and used after the Closing in the same manner as
immediately prior to the Closing.

                     (d) All improvements on the Real Property were constructed
in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements (including, but not limited
to, any building, planning or zoning Legal Requirements) affecting the Real
Property and no improvements on the Real Property and none of the current uses
and conditions thereof violate any applicable deed restrictions or other
applicable covenants, restrictions, agreements, existing site plan approvals,
zoning or subdivision regulations or urban redevelopment plans as modified by
any duly issued variances, and no permits, licenses or certificates pertaining
to the ownership or operation of all improvements on the Real Property, other
than those which are transferable with the Real Property, are required by any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Business.

                     (e) Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 3.12(e),
there have been no improvements of a value in excess of $10,000 in the aggregate
made to or construction on any Real Property within the applicable period for
the filing of mechanics' liens.

              3.13 Assets.

                     (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13, Seller or NSA, as
the case may be, owns, leases or has the legal right to use all of the assets,
properties, including real property and personal property, whether tangible or
intangible, and rights which are used or intended for use in or in connection
with the Business, including, without limitation, the Owned Intellectual

Business, and, with respect to contract rights, is a party to and enjoys the
right to the benefits of all contracts, agreements and other arrangements used
or intended to be used in or relating to the conduct of the Business, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other Legal Requirement affecting creditors' rights generally and
by other equitable principles, including, without limitation, those limiting the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies. Other than the Additional Assets, which are owned or held by Seller as
of the date hereof and will be transferred to Purchaser or an Affiliate or
assignee of Purchaser designated by Purchaser on the Closing Date, all of the
assets described

                                      -41-

                                      -42-
<PAGE>   48
       commitments, and sales and purchase orders, and under all commitments,
       bids and offers (to the extent such offers are transferable), used in, or

                           (ix) all municipal, state and federal Permits,

       and interest in, to and under all other assets, rights and claims of
       every kind and nature used in the Business.


Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13, Seller or NSA, as the case may be, has and
NSA will have as of the Closing Date good and marketable title to, or, in the
case of leased or subleased Assets, valid and subsisting leasehold interests in,
all the Assets, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for Permitted
Encumbrances.

                     (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or any Exhibit hereto or any Schedule furnished hereunder, the
Assets shall not include, and neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser

                           (i) All claims, causes of action, choses in action,
       rights of recovery and rights of set-off of any kind (including rights to

       Date, that are listed on Schedule 3.13(b) (as of the date of this
       Agreement or supplementally prior to the Closing Date) which (x) have
       been asserted on or prior to the Closing Date by Seller or any of its
       Affiliates and (y) which seek to recover for the account or benefit of
       Seller or any of its Affiliates all or a portion of any loss, cost,
       damage, expense or liability actually suffered or incurred by, or any
       amounts actually paid in repair, remediation, reconstruction or
       settlement (in each case, including reasonable attorneys' and
       consultants' fees) by, Seller or any of its Affiliates and not reflected
       as an asset on the Closing Balance Sheet;


                                      -43-
<PAGE>   49
                           (ii) all credits with respect to patronage capital

       Contract for the time period up to and including the Closing Date;

                           (iii) the Closed Potliner Disposal Areas; and

                           (iv) the equipment comprising the Current Groundwater
       Recovery and Treatment System.

                     (c) The Assets, including the Material Contracts (taken
together with the Shared Services Agreement, the Environmental Access and
Cooperation Agreement, the Aluminum Supply Agreement and the Power Supply
Agreements) constitute all the properties, assets and rights as are necessary in
and for the conduct of the Business as presently conducted. Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.13(c), all of the Assets with a replacement value in excess of
$5,000 and that (other than replacement parts or equipment) have been used in
the Business during the last twelve (12) months are and will be as of the
Closing Date in good repair and operating condition and suitable for the
purposes for which they are used or intended without the necessity of any
repairs, the costs of which are reasonably likely to exceed with respect to any
such Asset individually $10,000 or with respect to all such Assets $25,000 in
the aggregate, and, since the date of the Reference Balance Sheet, Seller has
and will have as of the Closing Date caused the Assets to be maintained in
accordance with NSA's normal maintenance standards consistent with past practice

license or other fees imposed in respect of the Assets as a result of, or
arising from, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for any applicable transfer, sales and use, recording,
documentary, stamp or other similar

                                      -44-
<PAGE>   50
taxes or fees related to or arising out of such assignment, transfer, conveyance
or delivery of the Assets which will be paid as provided for in Section 6.3(h).

              3.14 The Business.

                     (a) As a result of this Agreement and the transactions
provided for herein, Purchaser will acquire direct or indirect beneficial
ownership of all of the Assets.

                     (b) The Business will be operational on the Closing Date in
substantially the same manner as conducted immediately prior to the date hereof.

              3.15 Customers. Listed on Schedule 3.15(a) are the names and
addresses of, and contact persons for, the ten (10) most significant customers,
by revenue, of the Business (other than Southwire) for the calendar years 1997,
1998 and 1999, the aggregate amount for which each such customer was invoiced
for each such year and the discounts provided, if any.

              3.16 Product Warranties. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.16, no
product manufactured or sold by the Business is subject to any express warranty
or any other warranty other than any warranties that are implied by applicable
Legal Requirements.

              3.17 Tax Matters. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.17:

                     (a) Metalsco, Skyliner, and NSA (the "Companies"), and each
entity which has at any time been a member of an affiliated group within the
meaning of Code Section 1504(a) which included within such group any of the
Companies (such affiliated entities together with the Companies collectively as
the "Company Affiliated Group") have timely filed each Tax Return that they were
required to file. Each such Tax Return was correct and complete in all respects.
All Taxes owed by any member of the Company Affiliated Group (whether or not
shown on any Tax Return) have been paid in full for each taxable period during
which any of the Companies was a member of the Company Affiliated Group. No
member of the Company Affiliated Group is the beneficiary of any extension of
time that is currently in effect within which to file any Tax Return. No claim
has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where any member of the
Company Affiliated Group does not file Tax Returns that any member of the
Company Affiliated Group is or may be subject to Taxes by that jurisdiction.
There are no

                                      -45-
<PAGE>   51
liens on any of the assets of any of the Companies that arose in connection with
any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax.

                     (b) There is no dispute or claim, pending or Threatened,
concerning any Liability for Taxes of any member of the Company Affiliated Group
for any taxable period during which any of the Companies was a member of the
Company Affiliated Group either (1) claimed or raised by any authority in
writing, or (2) as to which the Seller and any member of the Company Affiliated
Group has Knowledge. Schedule 3.17 lists all federal, state, local, and foreign
income Tax Returns filed with respect the members of the Company Affiliated
Group for taxable periods for which the applicable statute of limitations has
not expired, and indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited, and
indicates those Tax Returns that currently are the subject of audit. The Seller
has delivered to, or made available to, the Purchaser correct and complete
copies of all federal, state and local income Tax Returns, examination reports,
and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the members of
the Company Affiliated Group since January 1, 1993. Neither the Seller nor any
director or officer (or employee or agent responsible for Tax matters) of any
member of the Company Affiliated Group expects any authority to assess any
additional Taxes against any member of the Company Affiliated Group for any
taxable period during which any of the Companies was a member of the Company
Affiliated Group.

                     (c) No member of the Company Affiliated Group has waived
any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of
time (where such waiver or extension is currently in effect) with respect to a
Tax assessment or deficiency.

                     (d) Neither the Seller nor any member of the Company
Affiliated Group has Knowledge of any proposed or Threatened reassessments of
any property owned by any member of the Company Affiliated Group or other
proposals that could increase the amount of Tax to which any member of the
Company Affiliated Group would be subject.

                     (e) None of the Companies has made any payments, or is
obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any agreement that under
certain circumstances could obligate it to make any payments that will not be
deductible under Code Section 280G.


                                      -46-
<PAGE>   52
                     (f) None of the Companies has filed a consent under Code
Section 341(f) concerning collapsible corporations. None of the Companies has
been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of
Code Section 897(c)(2) during the applicable period specified in Code Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii). Each member of the Company Affiliated Group has disclosed on
their federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that are reasonably
likely to give rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within
the meaning of Code Section 6662.

                     (g) The Seller will make available to the Purchaser prior
to Closing the following information with respect to each Company as of the most
recent practicable date (as well as on an estimated pro forma basis as of the
Closing giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby): (1) the basis of each Company in its assets, and (2) the amount of each
Company's net operating loss, net capital loss, unused investment or other
credit, unused foreign Tax credit, or excess charitable contributions.

                     (h) The unpaid Taxes of the Company Affiliated Group for
which the Companies would have Liability for Taxes do not, as of the Closing
Date, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (excluding any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the face of the Closing Balance Sheet.

              3.18 Employee Benefits.

                     (a) Schedule 3.18 lists every Employee Benefit Plan. A
complete and accurate copy of each Employee Benefit Plan (or, if not written, a
written summary of its material terms) and a complete and accurate copy of each
material document prepared in connection with each such Plan, has been provided
to or been made available to Purchaser prior to the Closing Date, including,
without limitation, (i) a copy of each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii)
each summary plan description, (iii) the most recently filed IRS Form 5500 and
(iv) the most recently prepared actuarial report and financial statement in
connection with each such Plan, if applicable. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.18 there are no other Employee Benefit Plans, whether formal or informal and
whether or not in writing


                                      -47-
<PAGE>   53
                     (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.18, neither Seller
nor any entity that together with Seller is considered a single employer within
the meaning of Section 414 of the Code ("ERISA Affiliate"), sponsors,
contributes to, or is obligated under Title I or IV of ERISA to contribute to a
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA Section 3(35)). Neither Seller nor
any ERISA Affiliate of NSA has had an "obligation to contribute" (as defined in
ERISA Section 4212) to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA Sections
4001(a)(3) and 3(37)(A)).

                     (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.18, all the Employee
Benefit Plans and the related trusts, to the extent applicable, have been
administered in material compliance with (i) the provisions of such Employee
Benefit Plans, (ii) the provisions of ERISA, (iii) provisions of the Code
relating to qualification and tax exemption under Code Sections 401(a) and
501(a) or otherwise applicable to secure intended tax consequences, (iv)
applicable state or federal securities laws, and (v) all other applicable Legal
Requirements and collective bargaining agreements, and neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates has received any notice from any Governmental Body questioning or
challenging such compliance. All available Governmental Authorizations for the
Employee Benefit Plans have been obtained, including, but not limited to, timely
determination letters on the qualification of any Employee Benefit Plan subject
to Code Section 401(a) and tax exemption of related trusts, as applicable under
the Code, and all such Governmental Authorizations continue in full force and
effect. A copy of the most recent determination letter has been delivered to
Purchaser, and nothing has occurred since the date of such letter which will or
could give rise to disqualification of any such Employee Benefit Plan or loss of
tax exemption or to any tax under Section 511 of the Code.

                     (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.18, there are no
unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the
Employee Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits which are payable in the
ordinary course and no litigation has been commenced with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan.

                     (e) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be
made with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan have been made on or before their
due dates. All such

                                      -48-
<PAGE>   54
contributions which have been deducted for income tax purposes have not been
challenged or disallowed by any government entity.

                     (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.18, the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any
current or former employee of Seller to severance pay, unemployment compensation
or any payment contingent upon a change in control or ownership of Seller, or a
sale of assets or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount, of any compensation due to any such employee or former employee.

              3.19 Compliance With Laws; Permits.

                     (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19(a), and except for
matters relating to compliance with Environmental Laws (the compliance with such
Environmental Laws being solely the subject of Section 3.24 hereof) and matters
relating to the Real Property and improvements thereon (the compliance with
Legal Requirements relating to the Real Property and improvements thereon being
solely the subject of Section 3.12 hereof):

                           (i) Seller or NSA, as the case may be, has and at
       Closing NSA shall have in effect all Permits or licenses (other than such
       Permits or licenses the failure to have in effect could not give rise to
       Liabilities in excess of $25,000 in the aggregate) necessary to operate
       and carry on the Business as presently conducted and to own and operate
       the Assets and there are no defects in any of such Permits or licenses
       and as of the Closing Date none of such Permits or licenses shall have
       been allowed to lapse or terminate;

                           (ii) the Business has been and continues to be
       conducted in accordance in all material respects with all Governmental
       Orders, and to the Knowledge of Seller, Metalsco, Skyliner and NSA, all
       Legal Requirements, applicable to the Business or the Assets; and

                           (iii) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has
       received (A) written notification or communication from any Governmental
       Body (x) asserting that any or all of them are not in compliance with any
       Legal Requirement which such

                                      -49-
<PAGE>   55
       Governmental Body enforces or administers, (y) threatening to revoke any
       Permit necessary for the conduct and operation of the Business, or (z)
       requiring a Person to enter into or consent to the issuance of a cease
       and desist order, formal agreement, directive, commitment or memorandum
       of understanding with respect to the operation of the Business, or (B) to
       the Knowledge of Seller, Metalsco, Skyliner and NSA, any oral
       notification or communication that has overtly threatened any such
       assertion, revocation or requirement, other than such of the foregoing
       which has been resolved to the satisfaction of the applicable
       Governmental Body and which will require no further action on the part of
       Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates.

                     (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19(b), all Permits
held or used by Seller and its Affiliates in connection with, or required for,
the Business, are either (i) held by NSA or Metalsco or (ii) transferable to the
Purchaser, an Affiliate of the Purchaser, or NSA and on the Closing Date will be
duly and validly transferred to the Purchaser, an Affiliate of the Purchaser, or
NSA, as the case may be, and in full force and effect upon the Closing.

       6. COVENANTS OF PURCHASER

              6.1 Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents.

                     (a) Purchaser shall make an appropriate filing, if
necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof and supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act. Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of any communication it
or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to
the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit Seller to review
in advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental
Authority.

                     (b) Purchaser shall cooperate and use reasonable best
efforts to assist the Seller in giving the notices and obtaining the consents
and estoppel certificates referred to in Section 5.9(b); provided, however, that
Purchaser shall have no obligation to give any guarantee or other consideration
of any nature in connection with any such notice, consent or estoppel
certificate or to consent to any change in the terms of any Material Contract
which Purchaser may reasonably deem adverse to the interests of Purchaser or the
Business.

                     (c) Purchaser shall use its best efforts to negotiate the
assumption by Purchaser of the Power Contract with the existing power supplier

              6.2 Labor Negotiations. From and after the date hereof, Purchaser
shall, acting in good faith, use reasonable commercial efforts to reach
agreement with the Union on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement
(which agreement shall be satisfactory to Purchaser in its sole discretion)
which shall be entered into by Purchaser with the Union as representative of the
workers employed by Purchaser at the Plant, the effectiveness of which shall be
a condition to the obligations of Purchaser hereunder, as set forth in Section

              6.3 Certain Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between Purchaser and the Seller for certain Tax
matters following the Closing Date:

                     (a) Returns and Payments. Purchaser shall prepare and file
or otherwise furnish in proper form to the appropriate Governmental Body (or
cause to be prepared and filed or so furnished) in a timely manner all Tax
Returns of the Companies after the Closing Date that are due on or before
(including extensions thereof) or relate to any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date, and which have not been filed on or before the Closing
Date. The Purchaser shall do the same for the Tax Returns of the Companies after
the Closing Date with respect to any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date and ending after the Closing Date. With respect to any Tax Return required
to be filed by the Purchaser with respect to the Companies, the Purchaser shall
provide the Seller and its Representatives with a copy of such completed Tax
Return and a statement certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return
that is allocable to Seller pursuant to Section 6.3(b), together with
appropriate supporting information and schedules at least fifty (50) days prior
to the due date (including extensions) for the filing of such Tax Return, and
the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return
that is allocable to the Seller pursuant to Section 6.3(b) in immediately
available funds in order that the Tax shown on such Tax Return will be timely
paid. The Seller and its Representatives shall have the right to review and
comment on such Tax Return and statement prior the filing of such Tax Return.
The Seller and the Purchaser agree to consult and resolve in good faith any
issue arising out of the review of any such Tax Return. In the event the parties
are unable to resolve any dispute within twenty (20) days following the delivery
of such Tax Return by the filing party to the non-filing party, the parties
shall resolve their dispute by jointly requesting that a mutually acceptable
accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") which is not the past or then current
principal auditor of the Purchaser or the Seller to resolve any issue at least
five (5) days before the due date of such Tax Return, in order that such Tax
Return may be timely filed and the Tax shown on such Tax Return to be timely
paid. The scope of the Accounting Firm's review shall be limited to the disputed
items. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between Seller and Purchaser in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally


                                      -74-
<PAGE>   80
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such
disputed items so submitted. With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed
by the Purchaser with respect to the Companies, the Purchaser shall provide the
Seller and its Representatives with a statement certifying the amount of tax
preparation fees paid by the Purchaser that is allocable to the Seller pursuant
to Section 6.3(b), and the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the amount of such
tax preparation fees that is allocable to the Seller pursuant to Section 6.3(b)
in immediately available funds within five (5) days of the receipt of such
statement.

                     (b) Tax Indemnity. Provided that the Purchaser or a member
of the Purchaser Affiliated Group makes a written demand for indemnification
against the Seller setting forth in reasonable detail the amount and the basis
for such amount ("Written Demand"), Seller shall indemnify and hold the
Purchaser harmless from and against all Taxes (including reasonable attorneys'
and accountants' fees and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection therewith) of the members of the Company Affiliated Group with
respect to all Pre-Closing Periods (as defined below), to the extent such Taxes
are not reflected in the reserve for Liability for Taxes (excluding any reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) shown on the face of the Closing Balance Sheet, or to the extent the
Seller has not paid to the Purchaser the amount of such Taxes pursuant to
Section 6.3(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if there is a good faith
dispute arising out of the Written Demand, the Seller and the Purchaser agree to
consult and resolve in good faith any dispute arising out of any such Written
Demand. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute within
twenty (20) days following the delivery of such Written Demand by the Purchaser
to the Seller, the parties shall resolve their dispute by jointly requesting the
Accounting Firm to resolve any issue. The scope of the Accounting Firm's review
shall be limited to the disputed items. The parties agree to be bound by the
determination of the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall make any such
determination within twenty-five (25) days after submission of the dispute. The
fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated
between Seller and Purchaser in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of
such remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm
that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so
submitted. For purposes of this section, "Pre-Closing Period" shall mean all
periods ending on or before the

                                      -75-
<PAGE>   81
Closing Date, and with respect to periods beginning before the Closing Date and
ending after the Closing Date, shall mean the portion of such period allocable
to the Seller. For purposes of this Section, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to
the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the
case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts,
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire taxable period, and (y) in the case of any
Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date.
Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date shall be taken into account in accordance with Section 6.3(d)
below. For purposes of this Section, with respect to any Tax Return that is due
on or before (including extensions thereof) or relate to any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date, all tax preparation fees (including
reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and other reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection therewith) paid by the Purchaser with respect to
such Tax Return shall be allocable to the Seller. For purposes of this Section,
with respect to any Tax Return that relates to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, the tax preparation
fees (including reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and other reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith) allocable to the Seller
shall be deemed to be the amount of such tax preparation fees (including
reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and other reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection therewith) multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the taxable period ending
on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire taxable period.

                     (c) Time of Payment. The Seller shall make the
indemnification payment for any amounts for which Purchaser makes a Written
Demand pursuant to Section 6.2(b) within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the
Written Demand, provided, however, that if the Seller disputes any aspect of the
Written Demand and such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm as provided
in Section 6.2(b), then the Seller shall make the indemnification

                                      -76-
<PAGE>   82
payment within five (5) days of receipt of the final determination by the
Accounting Firm with respect to any disputes.

                     (d) Tax Refunds and Credits. The Purchaser or any entity
which has at any time been a member of an affiliated group within the meaning of
Code Section 1504(a) which included within such group the Purchaser (such
affiliated entities together with the Purchaser, collectively a "Purchaser
Affiliated Group") shall, within forty-five (45) days following receipt of any
Tax refund, credit or offset, pay to the Sellers the amount of any Tax refund or
credit or offset (including any interest paid or credited or any offset allowed
with respect thereto), but reduced by any Taxes that the Purchaser or any member
of the Purchaser Affiliated Group shall be required to pay with respect thereto,
received or used, in the case of a credit or offset, by the Purchaser or any
member of the Purchaser Affiliated Group of Taxes (i) relating to taxable
periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (including any
Taxes allocated to such period under Section 6.3 except to the extent such Tax
refund, credit or offset is based on a net operating loss carryback within the
meaning of Code Section 172), or (ii) attributable to any amount paid by the
Sellers under Section 6.3. The amount of any refunds or credits or offsets
(including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) received by the
Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Affiliated Group shall be for the
account of the Purchaser if (i) the refund, credit or offset is of Taxes
relating to taxable periods that begin after the Closing Date (including any
Taxes allocated to such period under Section 6.3) or (ii) the refund, credit or
offset is of Taxes relating to taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or
before the Closing Date (including any Taxes allocated to such period under
Section 6.3) to the extent such Tax refund, credit or offset is based on a net
operating loss carryback within the meaning of Code Section 172. The Purchaser
may, for its own account, claim a refund, credit or offset that relates to an
adjustment to a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date that arises
from an adjustment to a taxable period beginning on or after the Closing Date,
provided, however, that the Seller must consent to any such refund claim, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld. For purposes of the foregoing,
withholding of consent shall be reasonable if such refund claim could reasonably
be expected to have a material tax cost or otherwise result in a Material
Adverse Effect on the Seller, provided however, that such refund claim will not
reasonably be expected to have a material tax cost or other Material Adverse
Effect on the Seller to the extent such refund claim is based on a net operating
loss carryback within the meaning of Code Section 172. The

                                      -77-
<PAGE>   83
Purchaser shall, if the Seller so requests and at the Seller's expense, cause
the relevant entity to file for and use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and expedite the receipt of any refund to which the Seller is entitled
under Section 6.3; provided, however, that the Purchaser must consent to any
such refund claim, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. For purposes
of the foregoing, withholding of consent shall be reasonable if such refund
claim could reasonably be expected to have a material tax cost or otherwise
result in a Material Adverse Effect to the Purchaser or a member of the
Purchaser Affiliated Group, provided however, that such refund claim will not
reasonably be expected to have a material tax cost or other Material Adverse
Effect on the Seller to the extent such refund claim is based on a net operating
loss carryback within the meaning of Code Section 172.

                     (e) Allocation of Purchase Price to Shares and Additional
Assets. Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller a proposed allocation of the purchase price (together with the
Assumed Indebtedness and other capitalizable costs) to the Shares and the
Additional Assets. If the Seller in good faith disagrees with the proposed
allocation, the Seller and Purchaser will attempt in good faith to promptly
agree on allocations. If the parties cannot resolve any such dispute within
thirty (30) Business Days of the delivery of such allocations, the items
remaining in dispute shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm. The Seller and
Purchaser shall be bound by the allocation of such items as determined by the
Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall make any such determination within
thirty (30) Business Days after submission of the remaining disputed items.

                           (1) Purchaser and Seller agree to file all Tax
       Returns consistent with the allocations described in Section 6.3(e) and
       not to take any position inconsistent therewith for any Tax purpose.

                           (2) The fees and disbursements of the Independent
       Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Seller and Purchaser in the
       same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed
       items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is
       unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the
       Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such disputed
       items so submitted.


                                      -78-
<PAGE>   84
                           (3) If any of the allocations described in Section
       6.3(e) are disputed by any Tax authority, the party receiving notice of
       such dispute shall promptly notify the other party of such dispute, and
       the Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good faith in responding to
       such challenge in order to preserve the effectiveness of such allocation.

                     (f) Contests. After the Closing Date, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall promptly notify the other party in writing upon receipt of
written notice of the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on the Seller, the Purchaser or
any member of the Purchaser Affiliated Group which, if determined adversely to
the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, would be grounds for indemnification by
the other party under Section 6.3. Such notice shall contain factual information
(to the extent known to the notifying party) describing the asserted Liability
for Taxes in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other
document received from any Tax authority in respect of any such asserted
Liability for Taxes. If the indemnitee under Section 6.3 fails to give the
indemnitor under Section 6.3 prompt notice of an asserted Liability for Taxes as
required by this Section 6.3(f), then the indemnitor shall not have any
obligation to indemnify for any loss arising out of such asserted Liability for
Taxes but only to the extent that failure to give such notice results in a
detriment to the indemnitor.

                           (1) In the case of an audit or administrative or
       judicial proceeding that relates to periods ending on or before the
       Closing Date, the Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense, to
       control the conduct of such audit or proceeding, but only to the extent
       that such audit or proceeding relates to a Tax for which the Seller has a
       potential indemnification obligation under Section 6.3; provided,
       however, that if the results of such contest could reasonably be expected
       to have a material Tax cost to the Purchaser or any member of the
       Purchaser Affiliated Group for any taxable period including or ending
       after the Closing Date, then the Seller and the Purchaser shall, each at
       its own expense, jointly control the defense and settlement of any such
       contest and each party shall cooperate with the other party at its own
       expense and there shall be no settlement or closing or other agreement
       with respect thereto without the consent of the other

                                      -79-
<PAGE>   85
       party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and, if the
       Seller does not assume the defense of any such audit or proceeding, the
       Purchaser may defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate,
       including, but not limited to, settling such audit or proceeding;
       provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not settle any such audit or
       proceeding without the consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
       unreasonably withheld. If the Seller chooses to control the contest, the
       Purchaser shall promptly empower and shall cause the members of the
       Purchaser Affiliated Group or other party promptly to empower (by power
       of attorney and such other documentation as may be appropriate) such
       Representatives of the Seller as they may designate to represent the
       Purchaser or the members of the Purchaser Affiliated Group or other party
       or its successor in the contest insofar as the contest involves an
       asserted Liability for Taxes for which the Seller would be liable under
       Section 6.3. The Purchaser shall have sole control over the defense and
       settlement of any contest relating to taxable periods or portions thereof
       that begin on or after the Closing Date (including, subject to Section
       6.3(f)(2) hereof, any Taxes allocated to such period under Section 6.3 or
       relating to taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
       Closing Date provided the Taxes to which such contest relates are Taxes
       for which Seller is not liable under Section 6.3 hereof, provided,
       however, that if the results of any such contest otherwise controlled by
       the Purchaser could reasonably be expected to have a material Tax cost or
       otherwise result in a Material Adverse Effect to the Seller, then the
       Seller and the Purchaser shall jointly control the defense and settlement
       of any such contest and each party shall cooperate with the other party
       at its own expense and there shall be no settlement or closing or other
       agreement with respect thereto without the consent of the other party,
       which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                           (2) With respect to periods beginning before the
       Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, (i) each party may
       participate in an audit or proceeding which relates to any such period
       and (ii) such audit or proceeding shall be controlled by that party which
       would bear the burden of the greater portion of the sum of the adjustment
       and any corresponding adjustments that may

                                      -80-
<PAGE>   86
       reasonably be anticipated for future Tax periods; provided that neither
       party shall settle any such audit or proceeding without the consent of
       the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
       principle set forth in the preceding sentence shall govern also for
       purposes of deciding any issue that must be decided jointly (in
       particular, choice of judicial forum) in situations in which separate
       issues are otherwise controlled hereunder by the Purchaser and the
       Seller.

                           (3) The Purchaser and the Seller agree to cooperate,
       and the Purchaser agrees to cause the members of the Purchaser Affiliated
       Group to cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any claim in
       any audit or proceeding.

                           (4) The Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser of
       the commencement of any claim, audit, examination or other written change
       or adjustment received by the Seller, in each case relating to the
       members of the Company Affiliated Group, by any Tax authority which could
       reasonably be expected to affect the Liability of the Purchaser or the
       members of the Purchaser Affiliated Group for a material amount of Taxes,
       and the Seller shall keep the Purchaser informed of the progress thereof.
       The failure to provide such notice shall not affect the indemnification
       obligations under this Section 6.3 unless the indemnified party is
       materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

                     (g) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar agreements with respect to or involving the Companies shall be
terminated by Companies as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the
Companies shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder and Seller
should indemnify the Purchaser and the Purchaser Affiliated Group for any such
Liability.

                     (h) Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such similar taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement, shall be
paid and shared equally by the Seller and the Purchaser when due, and the Seller
will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration


                                      -81-
<PAGE>   87
and other such similar taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law,
Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation.

                     (i) Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Seller and
the Purchaser will provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other in facilitating an appraisal
of the shares and the Additional Assets, preparing and filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a Liability for Taxes or a
right to a refund of Taxes, participating in or conducting any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes or making representations to or furnishing
information to parties subsequently desiring to purchase all or a part of the
Companies from the Purchaser. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of retained and relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating
to rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities. The Seller shall make its
employees available on a basis mutually convenient to both parties to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder. Neither the
Seller nor the Purchaser shall destroy, or cause the members of the Company
Affiliated Group to destroy, any Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the members of
the Company Affiliated Group for each taxable period first ending after the
Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) six months
after the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, including extensions, or (ii)
six years following the due date (including extensions) for such Tax Returns.
Any information obtained under this Section 6.3(i) shall be kept confidential
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

                     (j) Adjustment to Purchase Price. The Seller and the
Purchaser agree to treat all payments made under this Section 6.3 as adjustments
to the purchase price for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof.

                     (k) Survival. The covenants and obligations of parties
under this Section 6.3, and the representations and warranties of the Seller in
Section 3.17, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and
effect until the expiration of all statutes of limitations

                                      -82-
<PAGE>   88
on assessment or collection of Tax plus sixty (60) days with respect to any
Taxes that would be indemnifiable by the Seller under this Agreement.

                     (l) Tax Elections. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Seller shall not without prior written consent of the Purchaser
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld) make, or cause or permit to be
made, any Tax election not consistent with prior practices that could be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

              6.4 Environmental Cooperation and Access. From and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser will cooperate with Seller with respect to Seller's
obligations with respect to Environmental Matters related to the Real Property
or the Closed Potliner Disposal Areas, including but not limited to the Record
of Decision and any consent decree or Order issued with respect thereto;
provided that each of Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to ensure that (i) the performance by Seller of its obligations with
respect to Environmental Matters related to the Real Property or the Closed
Potliner Disposal Areas, including but not limited to the Record of Decision and
any consent decree or Order issued with respect thereto and Purchaser's
cooperation therewith shall not unduly interfere with the operation of the Plant
and the conduct of the Business; and (ii) the operation of the Plant and the
conduct of the Business shall not unduly interfere with the performance by
Seller of its obligations with respect to Environmental Matters related to the
Real Property or the Closed Potliner Disposal Areas, including but not limited
to the Record of Decision and any consent decree or Order issued with respect
thereto. To effect the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller shall enter into the
Environmental Access and Cooperation Agreement pursuant to which Purchaser shall
agree to provide Seller and its authorized agents access to, and certain rights
with respect to, portions of the Real Property as may be reasonably necessary to
enable Seller to carry out its obligations with respect to Environmental Matters
related to the Real Property or the Closed Potliner Disposal Areas, including
but not limited to the Record of Decision and any consent decree or Order issued
pursuant to the Record of Decision.


                                      -83-
<PAGE>   89
              6.5 Non-Solicitation. From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall not solicit or make any offer of employment or otherwise offer any
incentive to leave the employ of Seller to any employee of Seller.

              6.6 Financing. Purchaser covenants and agrees to use good faith
efforts to obtain financing sufficient in amount, when taken together with
capital funds otherwise available to Purchaser, to enable Purchaser to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions on the terms provided for herein.

              6.7 Post-Closing Actions.

                     (a) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing Date, it
shall not solicit or importune, and will not cause or permit any Affiliate of
Purchaser to solicit or importune, any Governmental Body to require or perform
any investigation, Remedial Action, correction of noncompliance or other action
relating to any Environmental Matter relating to the Real Property unless
required by any Environmental Law, Governmental Body, Order or third party

       7. EMPLOYEE MATTERS

              7.1 Employees.

                     (a) Hourly Employees. Effective upon Closing, Purchaser
will offer employment to all hourly Employees other than those hourly Employees
who have informed NSA or Seller that they will not return to NSA upon the
expiration of any applicable leave. Such employment will be on terms and
conditions acceptable to Purchaser and agreed to with the Union.

                     (b) Salaried Employees. Effective upon Closing, Purchaser
shall offer or cause to be offered employment as of the Closing Date to salaried
Employees on substantially the same terms, in the aggregate, as such Employees
were employed by NSA or any NSA Affiliate on the date of Closing. All salaried
Employees accepting Purchaser's offer of employment are referred to herein as
"Hired Salaried Employees." Purchaser shall recognize or cause to be recognized
a Hired Salaried Employee's length of service with NSA or an NSA Affiliate for
eligibility and vesting, but not benefit calculation, purposes under Purchaser's
or its Affiliate's employee benefit programs and for purposes of entitlement to
receive vacation days, sick days and holiday pay to the extent accrued and
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet, in accordance with the policies of
Purchaser. Purchaser shall allow all Hired Salaried Employees to take any
accrued but unused vacation days and sick days under policies of NSA or an NSA
Affiliate for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs. For purposes
of deductible limits and out-of-pocket annual maximums under their welfare plans
in the year in which the

                                      -85-
<PAGE>   91
Closing occurs, Purchaser or its Affiliate shall credit each Hired Salaried
Employee with any actual applicable deductibles satisfied and amounts paid
toward out-of-pocket annual maximums under the same type of benefit plan in
which such Hired Salaried Employee was participating on the date of this
Agreement.

                     (c) Salaries and Wages; Other Liabilities. Southwire shall
be responsible for paying all salaries and wages for all Employees for the time
period ending at 7:00 p.m. CST on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time") and
all bonuses and benefits payable to any Employees on or prior to the Effective
Time, together with all withholdings required by federal, state or local law
with respect to such salaries, wages and benefits. Southwire shall be
responsible for paying all post-retirement benefits of retired Employees who
have retired or who retire prior to or on the Closing Date. Seller shall retain
all liabilities relating to the agreements identified on Schedules 3.25(b) and
(c). In addition, it is the intent of the parties that all Hired Employees who
retire at any time after the Closing Date shall receive all benefits to which
they may be entitled as of the Closing Date under any pre-existing annuity
contract, and that such annuity contracts shall not be the responsibility of
Purchaser. Purchaser shall be responsible for paying (i) all bonuses of all
Hired Employees for the period from January 1, 2000 until the Effective Time
that become payable after the Effective Time but only to the extent the same are
accrued and reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet, (ii) all bonuses but not
contributions to 401(k) Plans for periods prior to the Effective Time of all
Hired Employees accruing from and after the Effective Time for the year ending
December 31, 2000 whether or not accrued or reflected on the Closing Balance
Sheet, (iii) all costs and liabilities for holiday pay and vacation time for the
Hired Employees for service during periods after the Effective Time, and (iv)
holiday pay and vacation time for Hired Employees for periods occurring prior to
the Effective Time that become payable after the Effective Time but only to the
extent accrued or reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet.

              7.2 Employee Benefit Plans. Effective as of the Closing Date,
Hired Employees shall cease to be eligible to actively participate in the
Southwire Company Profit Sharing and Retirement Plan and Trust (the "Southwire
401(k) Plan"). Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or
make available a defined contribution plan for Hired Employees ("Purchaser's
Defined Contribution Plan"). Purchaser shall credit Hired Employees

                                      -86-
<PAGE>   92
for their period of service with NSA or NSA Affiliate for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under the Purchaser's Defined Contribution Plan. If the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement does not
constitute a distribution event under the Southwire 401(k) Plan for a Hired
Employee, then, within a reasonable period of time after the Closing Date,
Southwire shall cause and Purchaser shall agree to accept a transfer from the
Southwire 401(k) Plan to Purchaser's Defined Contribution Plan of an amount
equal to the aggregate account balances held under the Southwire 401(k) Plan for
Hired Employees. Such transfer of assets shall comply with the applicable
requirements of the Code and ERISA. In addition, as part of such transfer,
Purchaser's Defined Contribution Plan shall accept any promissory notes that are
outstanding as of the Closing Date with respect to any Hired Employee who has
taken a participant loan from the Southwire 401(k) Plan.

              7.3 Medical Coverage. No Hired Employee (or eligible dependent
thereof) who is eligible and who elects to be covered under any medical or
disability insurance plan of Purchaser or its Affiliate shall be excluded from
coverage under such plan on the basis of a pre-existing condition that was not
also excluded under the applicable Southwire or NSA medical or disability
insurance plan. To the extent that a Hired Employee has satisfied in whole or in
part any annual deductible or paid any out-of-pocket or co-payment expenses
under a medical insurance plan of Southwire or NSA for a plan year, such
individual shall be credited therefor under the corresponding provisions of the
corresponding plan of Purchaser or its Affiliate in which such individual
participates after the Closing Date.

              renovation or demolition in any area of the Real Property that is
              or has been capped (including capping by soil or existing
              structures) in connection with, or the use of which is restricted
              pursuant to, the Record of Decision or any other Environmental
              Matter with respect to the Real Property for which Seller is

       claims as of the Closing Date, including without limitation those
       described in items 3 through 9 on Schedule 3.20; provided, however,
       Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party
       with respect to bonuses, costs and liabilities to be paid by Purchaser as
       provided in Section 7.1(c); or

                           (v) Liabilities relating to the Employee Benefit

       failure to comply with laws relating to bulk transfers or bulk sales with
       respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

       page 307).


provided, however, in no event shall "Loss" include lost profits or other
incidental or consequential damages unless recovered by a third party from the
Person seeking indemnification hereunder.

                     (b) To the extent that Seller's undertakings set forth in
this Section 11.2 may be unenforceable under applicable law, Seller shall
contribute the maximum amount that it is permitted to contribute under
applicable Legal Requirement to the payment and satisfaction of all Losses
incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified Party.

              11.3 Indemnification by Purchaser.

                     (a) Subject to Section 11.1, Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (each a "Seller Indemnified Party")
for any and all Losses actually suffered or incurred by them, arising out of or
resulting from:

                           (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made
       by Purchaser contained in this Agreement; or

                           (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by
       Purchaser contained in this Agreement; or

                           (iii) Liabilities resulting in Section 11.4 Losses
       (as hereinafter defined), to the extent such Section 11.4 Losses are
       allocated to Purchaser in accordance with Section 11.4; or


                                      -97-
<PAGE>   103
                           (iv) any liabilities or obligations resulting from or
       arising out of the conduct of the Business after the Closing Date, except
       for any liabilities or obligations with respect to which Seller is
       obligated to indemnify a Purchaser Indemnified Party; or

                           (v) the Assumed Indebtedness and the Assumed
       Liabilities.

                     (b) To the extent that Purchaser's undertakings set forth
in this Section 11.3 may be unenforceable, Purchaser shall contribute the
maximum amount that it is permitted to contribute under applicable Legal
Requirement to the payment and satisfaction of all Losses incurred by a Seller
Indemnified Party.

              11.4 Allocation of Certain Losses. To the extent that Liabilities
under Environmental Laws relate to or arise from any on-site disposal or Release
of Hazardous Materials which occurred prior to the Closing and which is not
Known to Seller as of the Closing Date, indemnification for Losses arising out
of or resulting from such Liabilities (each a "Section 11.4 Loss") shall be
allocated between Seller and Purchaser as set forth in the following paragraph;
it being agreed by Seller and Purchaser that, in the case of a dispute with
respect to any Liabilities under Environmental Laws that relate to or arise from
any on-site disposal or Release of Hazardous Materials, as to whether the
on-site disposal or Release occurred (a) prior to the Closing or (b)
post-Closing, it shall be a presumption in such dispute, rebuttable by Seller,
that any such disposal or Release occurred prior to the Closing, if such
disposal or Release becomes Known during the period from the Closing Date
through the day prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, and it shall
be a presumption in such dispute, rebuttable by Purchaser, that any such
disposal or Release occurred post-Closing, if such disposal or Release becomes
Known at any time on or after the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

              Seller shall be responsible for 55% and Purchaser shall be
responsible for 45% of all Section 11.4 Losses which relate to or arise from
on-site disposals or Releases of Hazardous Materials which occurred prior to the
Closing Date but were not Known to Seller as of the Closing Date and which
become Known during the period from the Closing Date through the day prior to
the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible for 45%
and

                                      -98-
<PAGE>   104
Purchaser shall be responsible for 55% of Section 11.4 Losses which relate to or
arise from on-site disposals or Releases of Hazardous Materials which occurred
prior to the Closing Date but were not Known to Seller as of the Closing Date
and which become Known during the period from the fourth anniversary of the
Closing Date through the day prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date.
From and after the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall have no
responsibility for Section 11.4 Losses (whether based on breach of
representation and warranty or otherwise), and Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for, and shall indemnify Seller against all Section 11.4 Losses,
which relate to or arise from on-site disposals or Releases of Hazardous
Materials which occurred prior to the Closing Date but were not Known to Seller
as of the Closing Date and which become Known on or after the sixth anniversary
date of the Closing Date.

              11.5 Certain Limitations.

                     (a) Except as set forth in the last sentence of this
Section 11.5, the Seller shall be obligated to indemnify a Purchaser Indemnified
Party only when the aggregate of all Losses suffered or incurred by all
Purchaser Indemnified Parties as to which a right of indemnification is provided
under this Article 11 exceeds Three Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Dollars
($375,000) (the "Threshold Amount"). After the aggregate of all such Losses
exceeds the Threshold Amount, the Seller shall be obligated to indemnify all
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for all Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount
suffered or incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified Party as to which a right of
indemnification is provided hereunder. Except as set forth in the next
succeeding sentence, the aggregate liability of Seller under this Article 11
shall not exceed Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (the "Maximum
Amount"). Notwithstanding the above, the Threshold Amount and Maximum Amount
limitations shall not apply to the indemnification obligations of the Seller
pursuant to Sections 6.3, 11.2(a)(iii) and 11.2(a)(viii), and the payment of
amounts by the Seller pursuant to such Sections shall not count toward the
calculation of the Threshold Amount or Maximum Amount.

                     (b) In the event that any Purchaser Indemnified Party shall
receive any payment from any other Person under any insurance policy,
indemnification agreement, warranty or other similar right in satisfaction of or
recovery for any claim relating to a Loss with respect to

                                      -99-
<PAGE>   105
which such Purchaser Indemnified Party was indemnified by and received payment
thereon from Seller, then such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall pay over to
Seller, after deducting all costs and expenses incurred by such Purchaser
Indemnified Party in recouping such payment, the amount of such payment to the
extent it represents a double recovery with respect to such Loss.
Notwithstanding the above, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be under any
obligation to assert or pursue any such claim relating to any Loss.

              11.6 Notification of Claims.

                     (a) A party that may be entitled to be indemnified pursuant
to Section 11.2 or 11.3 (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify the
party liable for such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of
any pending or threatened claim or demand which the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement, describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand; provided, however, that
the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this Section 11 except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. Subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to defend in good faith claims as hereinafter provided, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy or contest its obligations under this Section
11 within 30 days after the receipt of written notice thereof from the
Indemnified Party.

                     (b) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that
may result from such claim or demand, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such claim or demand at its
expense and through counsel and consultants of its choice if it gives notice of
its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the
receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense and retain separate counsel
and consultants at its own cost and expense, without prejudice to the rights of
the parties to control the defense of their respective interests. In the event
the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against
any such claim or demand as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's
possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the
Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any
such claim or demand, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party,
at the

                                     -100-
<PAGE>   106
Indemnifying Party's expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and
information in the Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified
Party. No such claim or demand may be settled by the Indemnifying Party without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

              11.7 Indemnification Agreements. The parties hereto agree that to
the extent Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, on the one hand, or this
Agreement, on the other hand, Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, shall be entitled to seek indemnification under any
one or more of such agreements; provided that to the extent a claim is made
under one or more of such agreements, the validity of such claim shall be
determined separately under each such agreement and to the extent valid under
more than one such agreement, Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party
may in its sole discretion elect under which agreement or agreements Seller
shall make such indemnification payment (and any amounts payable in respect of
such claim shall be determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the agreement or agreements designated by Purchaser and such amounts paid shall
not be taken into consideration for purposes of determining the deductible or
the maximum amount recoverable under any other agreement); provided that any
recovery in respect of such claim shall be limited to the amount of Loss in
respect of such claim.

              11.8 Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
expressed or implied herein, no claim may be asserted by any Seller Indemnified
Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party based upon the breach of any representation
or warranty contained herein after the last day of the period set forth in
Section 11.1 above for which the representation or warranty that is the subject
of such claim survives.


                                     -101-
<PAGE>   107
              11.9 Exclusive Remedies; Materiality. If the Closing occurs, the
remedies provided in this Article 11 constitute the sole and exclusive remedies
for recoveries against another party for breaches of the representations and
warranties in Sections 3 and 4 and for the matters specifically listed in
Sections 11.2 and 11.3 as being indemnified against (whether any claim based on
the facts and circumstances giving rise to such right of indemnification could
also be made in contract, breach of warranty, tort or otherwise). Purchaser's or
Seller's rights to claim indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2 or 11.3 for a
fact or event described in either such Section shall not be affected (except as
specifically described therein and in Section 11.4 with respect to certain
Environmental Matters) by Purchaser's or Seller's Knowledge of such fact or
event on or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
expressed or implied herein, following the adjustment to the Purchase Price
contained in Section 2.5(b)(ii), Purchaser shall have no right to such
indemnification under this Article 11 for breaches of representations or
warranties contained in Sections 3.9 and 3.10 hereof.

              11.10 Satisfaction of Indemnification Obligations. Subject to the
limitations and procedures set forth above, claims for indemnified Losses shall
be satisfied as follows:

                           (i) By Southwire. Southwire shall satisfy its
       liability for indemnification Losses by paying the amount of such
       liability to Purchaser as Purchaser directs.

                           (ii) By Purchaser. Purchaser shall satisfy its
       liability for indemnification Losses by paying the amount of such
       liability to Southwire as Southwire directs.

              11.11 Indemnity Support.

                     (a) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser an
irrevocable letter of credit (the "Indemnity Support") in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit I, payable in the amount of Fifteen Million Dollars
($15,000,000) issued in favor of Purchaser, such amount only to be reduced in
accordance with Section 11.11(d) below. Such Indemnity Support shall be issued
by a U.S. chartered bank with equity capital of at least $1,000,000,000 and with
a long-term deposit rating of A- or better from Standard & Poor's Ratings
Service (S&P) (or its

                                     -102-
<PAGE>   108
equivalent from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's)) (such bank, the
"Indemnity Support Issuer"). If the Indemnity Support Issuer's long-term deposit
rating falls below BBB+ from S&P (or its equivalent from Moody's) after issuance
of the Indemnity Support and the Indemnity Support is not replaced by Seller,
not later than 30 days following receipt by Seller of written notice of such
reduced rating, with a letter of credit in the form of Exhibit I issued by a
bank with a rating which meets the requirements of the immediately preceding
sentence, then Purchaser shall have the right to draw on the Indemnity Support
in full. The Indemnity Support may be drawn upon by Purchaser in its discretion
in the event of any Losses which may be subject to the indemnification
provisions of Section 11.2(a)(iii) or Section 11.2(a)(viii). The Indemnity
Support shall provide that it may be drawn upon by the Purchaser upon delivery
to the Indemnity Support Issuer of a certificate in the form attached as Annex B
to the Indemnity Support. The Indemnity Support shall provide that the amount of
such support may be reduced upon delivery to the Indemnity Support Issuer of a
certificate from Seller in the form attached as Annex D to the Indemnity
Support. The Indemnity Support shall further provide that the Purchaser shall be
entitled to draw the full amount of the Indemnity Support if within thirty (30)
days prior to the expiration date of the then current Indemnity Support, such
Indemnity Support has not been renewed or replaced by support meeting the
requirements hereof in an amount equal to the then current amount thereof (or a
reduced amount in accordance with Section 11.11(d)).

                     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 11.11(c), Seller
covenants and agrees to deliver within 15 days after the end of the relevant
fiscal quarter to Purchaser additional Indemnity Support, in the form of Exhibit
I and issued by an Indemnity Support Issuer meeting the requirements set forth
in Section 11.11(a), payable in the amount of Fifteen Million Dollars
($15,000,000), which shall be in addition to the Indemnity Support provided
pursuant to Section 11.11(a), if, at the end of any fiscal quarter of Seller,
the net worth of Seller and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis ("Seller's
Consolidated Net Worth") shall be equal to or less than Two Hundred Fifty
Million Dollars ($250,000,000), as shown on Seller's consolidated balance sheet
as of the end of such quarter prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied. This additional Indemnity Support may subsequently be terminated
(subject to reinstatement if the condition in the first sentence of this
paragraph (b) should again apply) if, following the quarterly period at the end
of which Seller's Consolidated Net Worth was less than $250,000,000, the
Seller's Consolidated Net Worth was greater than $250,000,000 as of the end of
any two (2)

                                     -103-
<PAGE>   109
consecutive quarterly periods. For the Term (as hereinafter defined), within
thirty (30) days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of
each fiscal year of Seller, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a certificate,
signed by Seller's Chief Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer,
certifying that Seller's Consolidated Net Worth as of the end of such fiscal
quarter either exceeds $250,000,000 or is equal to or less than that amount, as
shown on Seller's consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. Within sixty (60) days
after the end of each fiscal year of Seller, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a
certificate, signed by Seller's Independent Accountant, certifying that Seller's
Consolidated Net Worth as of the end of such fiscal year either exceeds
$250,000,000 or is equal to or less than that amount, as shown on Seller's
consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal year prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied.

                     (c) Seller may in its sole discretion substitute a portion
of the Indemnity Support required hereunder for coverage of Environmental
Matters by obtaining and maintaining an insurance policy covering any and all
Environmental Matters which may be the subject of indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.2(a)(iii) or Section 11.2(a)(viii). Any such insurance policy shall
be provided by an insurance carrier having a rating of A or better from A.M.
Best, and such policy shall name Purchaser as an insured party. The amount,
scope and terms of any such insurance policy shall be satisfactory to Purchaser
in its reasonable discretion.

                     (d) The Indemnity Support delivered to Purchaser at the
Closing and any additional Indemnity Support delivered to Purchaser pursuant to
Section 11.11 (b), shall have a duration of seven (7) years from the Closing
Date (the "Term"), either by its terms or by providing for automatic renewal,
and shall be irrevocable. The amount of the Indemnity Support shall not be
reduced, except as provided in Section 11.11(b) and except in accordance with
this Section 11.11(d).

                           (i) The amount of the Indemnity Support may be
       reduced, in the amounts specified in each of clauses (A) and (B) below,
       at any time, so long as (x) Seller's Consolidated Net Worth, as certified
       by Seller's Chief Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer, is in
       excess of Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000), (y)

                                     -104-
<PAGE>   110
       Seller shall have complied with all of its obligations for
       indemnification under this Section 11, and (z) any of the following
       events shall have occurred:

                                   (A) the amount of the Indemnity Support then
               outstanding may be reduced by the amount of Five Million Dollars
               ($5,000,000), in the event that Seller obtains a policy of
               insurance from an insurance provider having a rating of A or
               better from A.M. Best, naming Purchaser as an additional insured
               thereunder (without obligation for the payment of any premium)
               and providing for the payment of all costs which may be incurred
               in connection with (1) the remediation activities required under
               the Record of Decision, or (2) the remediation activities
               required with respect to the plant site of the Gaston Copper
               Recycling Corporation in South Carolina (or Ten Million Dollars
               ($10,000,000) in the aggregate in the case of both (1) and (2)),
               and shall have provided to Purchaser reasonably satisfactory
               evidence thereof; and

                                   (B) the amount of the Indemnity Support then
               outstanding may be reduced by the corresponding amount indicated
               on Schedule 11.11(d), in each instance (the amount of such
               reductions not to exceed Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) in the
               aggregate), in the event that Seller shall have obtained a final
               judgment or settlement, and shall have satisfied in full its
               obligations, if any, with respect thereto, in each of the
               Environmental Matters listed on Schedule 11.11(d), and shall have
               provided to Purchaser reasonably satisfactory evidence thereof;

The reductions in the Indemnity Support permitted by clauses (A) and (B) above
may be cumulative; provided, however, that at no time prior to the end of the
Term shall the amount of the Indemnity Support be reduced to less than Three
Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (or Eighteen Million Dollars ($18,000,000) so long
as the additional Indemnity Support has been issued and not subsequently reduced
as provided in Section 11.11(b) above). The amount of the Indemnity Support
shall be increased from its then current level by the amount of Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (but not to exceed the applicable maximum Indemnity
Support amount of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) pursuant to Section
11.11(a) or Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) pursuant to Section 11.11(b),
as the case may be) in the event that Seller or any of

                                     -105-
<PAGE>   111
its Affiliates, or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, shall become subject to
any Liability for Environmental Matters which was not known or had not been
asserted as of the Closing Date and which may be or becomes the subject of a
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(iii) or (viii). Upon the
occurrence of any such event, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof in
writing.

                     (e) The rights of Purchaser with respect to the Indemnity
Support provided for in this Section 11.11 shall be without prejudice to any
other rights that Purchaser may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and
Purchaser's election not to draw on the Indemnity Support in any instance shall
not be deemed to be a waiver of any of such other rights of Purchaser or any
further rights Purchaser may have with respect to the Indemnity Support.

       12. GENERAL PROVISIONS

              12.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
