by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Code_ "), or under any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent amounts are so

 withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made.

invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a

investment of such Exchange Fund shall be limited to cash and cash
equivalents, direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations
fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government and
money market funds comprised primarily of cash, cash equivalents and such
obligations and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to the holders of Common
Units converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to this _Article
III_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid promptly to Parent.

Merger Consideration with respect to each Restricted Unit that becomes vested
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_, along with any corresponding accrued
but unpaid distributions with respect to the DERs related to any Restricted
Units, which unpaid distributions, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
constitute Merger Consideration. Immediately upon the vesting of such
Restricted Units, the DERs associated therewith shall be cancelled and cease
to exist.

take all actions necessary to terminate the Partnership Incentive
Compensation Plan, such termination to be effective at the Effective Time, and

different number of units or a different class or series by reason of the

of units or similar transaction, the distributions under this _Article III_
 and _Section_ __ _ 6.17_, the Merger Consideration and any other similar
dependent item, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of such unit distribution, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, combination, exchange of
units or similar transaction and to provide the holders of Common Units the
same economic effect as contemplated hereby prior to such event.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the limitations in _Section_ __

Partnership, the Partnership GP or any of their duly authorized

pertaining to the Partnership, or entering into or participating in
discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material and intentional
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ (a " _Receiving Party_ "), if, and only
to the extent that (i) the GP Board, after consultation with the GP Conflicts
Committee, determines in its good faith judgment (A) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (B)
that failure to take such action would be a breach of its duties to the
Partnership Unaffiliated Unitholders under applicable Law, as modified by the
Partnership Agreement, or the Partnership Agreement and (ii) prior to
furnishing or making available any such non-public information to such
Receiving Party, the Partnership receives from such Receiving Party an

Information Statement (the taking of any action described in clauses (i) or
(ii) being referred to as a " _Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 



29

    

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that (a) any
violation of the restrictions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ by the Partnerships Subsidiaries or the
Representatives of any of the Partnership, the Partnership GP or
the Partnerships Subsidiaries, will be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_ by the Partnership and the Partnership GP and (b) no act
or failure to act by Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives,
and no violation caused by or at the explicit direction of Parent, shall be a
violation or breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ by the Partnership or the
Partnership GP.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Written Consent being delivered and becoming effective, and
subject to compliance in all material respects with this _Section_ __ _
6.3(d)_, the GP Board, after consulting with the GP Conflicts Committee, may
(x) make a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_, in each case:

(i) in response to an Intervening Event, if the GP Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with the GP Conflicts Committee) that the failure to
take such action would be a breach of its duties to the Partnership
Unaffiliated Unitholders under applicable Law, as modified by the Partnership
Agreement, or the Partnership Agreement;

(ii) if the GP Board has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying
in reasonable detail the material events giving rise to the Intervening Event
at least five Business Days in advance of its intention to take such action
with respect to a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change, or to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_, as the case may be,
unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are
fewer than five Business Days prior to the expected date of the delivery and
effectiveness of the Written Consent, in which case such notice shall be
provided as far in advance as practicable (the period inclusive of all such
days, the " _Partnership Intervening Event Notice Period_ "); and 

(iii) if, during the Partnership Intervening Event Notice Period, the GP Board
has negotiated and has used its reasonable best efforts to cause its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate, with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate, in its sole discretion) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
the failure to effect such Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_, as the case
may be, would not be a breach of its duties to the Partnership Unaffiliated
Unitholders under applicable Law, as modified by the Partnership Agreement, or
the Partnership Agreement; provided, however, that the GP Board or the GP
Conflicts Committee, as applicable, shall take into account all changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in determining whether the
failure to make, or in the case of the GP Conflicts Committee, recommend a
Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_, as the case may be, would be a
breach of its duties to the Partnership Unaffiliated Unitholders under
applicable Law, as modified by the Partnership Agreement, or the Partnership
Agreement.

 



30

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Written Consent being delivered and becoming effective, and
subject to compliance in all material respects with this _Section_ __ _
6.3(e)_, the GP Board, after consulting with the GP Conflicts Committee, may,
in addition to  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_, make a Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change:

(i) in response to a Superior Proposal, if the GP Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with the GP Conflicts Committee) that the failure to
take such action would be a breach of its duties to the Partnership
Unaffiliated Unitholders under applicable Law, as modified by the Partnership
Agreement, or the Partnership Agreement;

(ii) if the GP Board has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying
in reasonable detail the reasons for such action at least five Business Days
in advance of its intention to take such action with respect to a Partnership
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless at the time such notice is otherwise
required to be given there are fewer than five Business Days prior to the
expected date of the delivery and effectiveness of the Written Consent, in
which case such notice shall be provided as far in advance as practicable (the
period inclusive of all such days, the " _Partnership Superior Proposal
Notice Period_ "); and

(iii) if, during the Partnership Superior Proposal Notice Period, the GP
Board has negotiated and has used its reasonable best efforts to cause its
financial advisors (if any) and outside legal counsel to negotiate, with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate, in its sole
discretion) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the failure to effect such Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change would not be a breach of its duties to the
Partnership Unaffiliated Unitholders under applicable Law, as modified by the
Partnership Agreement, or the Partnership Agreement; provided, however, that
the GP Board, or the GP Conflicts Committee, as applicable, shall take into
account all changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
determining whether the failure to make, or in the case of the GP Conflicts
Committee, recommend a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change would be a
breach of its duties to the Partnership Unaffiliated Unitholders under
applicable Law, as modified by the Partnership Agreement, or the Partnership
Agreement.

(f) In addition to the other obligations of the Partnership set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the Partnership shall promptly advise Parent and the GP
Board, orally and in writing, and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any
information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought
to be initiated or continued with, the Partnership in respect of any
Acquisition Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent and the GP
Board, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with
such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter
shall promptly keep Parent and the GP Board reasonably informed of all
material developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals,
offers, inquiries or requests (and the Partnership shall promptly provide
Parent and the GP Board with copies of any additional written materials
received by the Partnership or, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, that the
Partnership has

 



31

    

 delivered to any third party making an Acquisition Proposal that relate to
such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such
proposals, offers, inquiries or requests. 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_ shall be
deemed to give the Partnership any right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_.

Section 6.4 _Consummation of the Merger_. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and each of the Partnership and the Partnership GP, on
the other hand, shall cooperate with the other and use, and shall cause each
of their respective Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing

Subsidiary of Parent that agrees to be bound by the Support Agreement, sell,
transfer, assign, tender in any tender or exchange offer, pledge, encumber,
hypothecate or similarly dispose of (by merger, by distribution, by operation
of Law or otherwise), either voluntarily or involuntarily, or enter into any
Contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the
sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation or other
disposition of (by merger, by distribution, by operation of Law or
otherwise), any Common Units owned by VTDC as of the date hereof, (B) deposit

of Parent.

Section 6.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release or releases
with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably agreed

32

    

 Thereafter, neither the Partnership nor Parent shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent
not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or by
any applicable listing requirement of, or agreement with, the NYSE or other
national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
Party proposing to make such release (in which case such Party shall
not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other Party); provided,
however, that the Partnership shall not be required by this _Section_ __ _
6.5_ to consult with any other Party with respect to public announcements in
connection with a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change but nothing in
this proviso shall limit the obligations of the Partnership, the Partnership
GP, the GP Board or the GP Conflicts Committee under _Section_ __ _ 6.3_;
provided, further, that each Party and their respective Affiliates may make
statements that are consistent with statements made in previous press

and its Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, Contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Partnership shall not be required to disclose any information to Parent if
such disclosure would, in the opinion of the Partnerships legal counsel, be
reasonably likely to (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege or (ii) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date hereof; provided, however, that the
Partnership shall take all reasonable measurers to disclose such information
in a manner that would not jeopardize or contravene such privilege, Law, duty
or contractual right.

 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, solely to the extent that the
Partnership or the Partnership GP or any applicable Subsidiary thereof would
be permitted to indemnify an Indemnified Person immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and the Partnership GP jointly and
severally agree to (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless against any cost or
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, settlements, fines and other
sanctions, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding, and provide
advancement of expenses with respect to each of the foregoing to, all
Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
(ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of officers and
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses contained in the Organizational Documents of the
Partnership and the Partnership GP immediately prior to the Effective Time and
ensure that the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity and the
Partnership GP or any of their respective successors or assigns, if
applicable, shall, for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement 

 



33

    

 of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers,
employees and agents of the Partnership and the Partnership GP than are
presently set forth in such Organizational Documents. Any right of an
Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_ shall not be
amended, repealed, terminated or otherwise modified at any time in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Person as provided
herein, and shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Person and their
respective heirs and representatives against the Surviving Entity and the
Partnership GP and their respective successors and assigns.

 

(b) Parent shall maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the
Partnerships current directors and officers liability insurance policies
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Indemnified Persons (provided that Parent may substitute therefor
policies with reputable carriers of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons);
provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be required to expend
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_ more than an amount per year equal
to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Partnership or the Partnership
GP for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent would be
required to expend more than the Maximum Amount, Parent shall obtain the
maximum amount of such insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. If
the GP Board in its sole discretion elects, then, in lieu of the obligations
of Parent under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_, the Partnership may (but shall
be under no obligation to), prior to the Effective Time, purchase a six-year "
_tail policy_ " with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to
have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to
have been committed by such Indemnified Persons in their capacity as such.

 

(c) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall
be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Partnership and the Partnership GP or any
indemnification agreements, or the DLLCA and DRULPA. The provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby for a period of six years and are expressly intended to
benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and
representatives; provided, however, that in the event that any claim or
claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.7_ are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of all such claims. If the Surviving Entity and/or
the Partnership GP, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other
Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity or
the Partnership GP shall assume the obligations of the Surviving Entity and
the Partnership GP set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

 

Section 6.8 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __
_ 8.2_, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby including all legal, accounting, financial
advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of third parties
incurred by a Party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective Party incurring such fees
and expenses, except Parent and the Partnership shall each bear and pay one
half of the

 



34

    

 expenses, other than the expenses of financial advisors or outside legal
advisors, incurred in connection with the preparation, printing, filing and
mailing of the Partnership Information Statement and Schedule 13E-3.

Section 6.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Partnership and the Partnership GP shall, with Parents and Merger Subs
cooperation, take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Common Units
(including derivative securities with respect to Common Units) resulting from
the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Partnership to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

Section 6.10 _Termination of Trading and Deregistration_. The Partnership
will cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the
NYSE to enable (a) the delisting of the Common Units from the NYSE and the
termination of trading of the Common Units on the Closing Date and prior to
the Effective Time and (b) the deregistration of the Common Units under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event no more than ten days after the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.11 _GP Conflicts Committee_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action intended to cause the
Partnership GP to, without the consent of a majority of the then existing
members of the GP Conflicts Committee, eliminate the GP Conflicts
Committee, revoke or diminish the authority of the GP Conflicts Committee or
remove or cause the removal of any member of the GP Conflicts Committee,
either as a member of the GP Board or the GP Conflicts Committee. For the
avoidance of doubt, this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall not apply to the
filling, in accordance with the provisions of the Partnership GP LLC
Agreement, of any vacancies caused by the resignation, death or incapacity of
any such director.

 

Section 6.12 _Performance by the Partnership GP_. The Partnership GP shall
cause the Partnership and its Subsidiaries to comply with the provisions of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that actions or inactions by the Partnership, the Partnership GP and their
respective Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be breaches or violations
or failures to perform by the Partnership, the Partnership GP and their
respective Subsidiaries of any of the provisions of this Agreement if such
action or inaction was or was not taken, as applicable, at the explicit
direction of Parent, its Affiliates or their respective duly authorized
Representatives.

Section 6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. The Partnership, the Partnership GP and
Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to (a) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if any Takeover Statute
becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all
action necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise
minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the transactions.

 



35

    

Section 6.14 _No Rights Triggered_. The Partnership and the Partnership GP
shall take all steps necessary to ensure that the entering into of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or
related hereto and any other action or combination of actions do not and will
not result in the grant of any Rights to any Person under the Partnership
Agreement or under any material agreement to which the Partnership or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party.

 

Section 6.15 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each Party shall give prompt
notice to the other Parties of (a) any fact, event or circumstance known to
such Party that (i) would, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, result in any Partnership
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) could cause
or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein, (b) any change in the Partnerships
financial condition or business that has resulted, or would result, in a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect and (c) any Proceedings, to the extent
such Proceedings relate to this Agreement or the Merger or could result in a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 6.16 _Transaction Litigation_. The Partnership shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
against the Partnership, the Partnership GP or its respective directors
relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of
Parent. 

Section 6.17 _Distributions_. The Partnership GP shall declare, and shall
cause the Partnership to pay, the Partnerships regular quarterly cash
distribution with respect to the quarter ended September 30, 2018 in the
ordinary course, with timing consistent with past practice and in accordance

the prior approval of the GP Conflicts Committee; provided, further, that,
prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership GP shall not declare, and the
Partnership shall not pay, any distribution other than the Third Quarter
Distribution without the prior written consent of Parent. The Partnership and
Parent shall coordinate the timing of the Third Quarter Distribution so that

Section 6.18 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) For U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state, local or foreign Tax that follows the U.S. federal income Tax
treatment), the Parties agree to treat the Merger (a) with respect to the
holders of the Common Units (other than Common Units held by Parent and its
Subsidiaries), as a taxable sale of their Common Units to VTDC and (b) with
respect to VTDC, as a purchase by VTDC of Partnership Interests from the
holders of the Common Units (other than Common Units held by Parent and its
Subsidiaries). The Parties will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent
with the foregoing and will not take any inconsistent position on any Tax
Return, or during the course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law following a
final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
administrative settlement with or final administrative decision by the
relevant Governmental Authority.

(b) The Parties shall not (and shall cause their Affiliates not to) make any
change in respect of the Partnerships methods of allocating income or
deductions for federal income Tax purposes that would adversely affect the
Partnership Unaffiliated Unitholders, including a change to the method of
allocation prescribed under Section 6.2(f) of the Partnership Agreement.

to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of

a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_
and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent or Merger Sub

_Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be

Party hereto from any liability for any failure to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby when required pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, that in the event of a Partys intentional and
material breach of this Agreement or intentional fraud, then the other
applicable Party or Parties shall be entitled to pursue any and all legally
available remedies, including equitable relief, and to seek recovery of all
losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses of every kind and nature
(including reasonable attorneys fees and time value of money). For the

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 9.1 _No Survival, Etc._. The representations, warranties and
agreements in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement)
shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, as the case may be, except that the agreements set forth
in _Article I_ , _Article II_ , _Article III_ , _Section_ __ _ 6.7_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ and
any other agreement in this Agreement that contemplates performance after the
Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified in any and all
respects, whether before or after the Written Consent is delivered and becomes
effective, by written agreement of the Parties, by action taken or authorized
by the Parent Special Committee and the GP Board; provided, however, that
this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented without the prior
approval of the GP Conflicts Committee; provided, further, that after the
Written Consent is delivered and becomes effective, there shall be no
amendment or change to the provisions of this Agreement which by applicable
Law or stock exchange rule would require further approval by the Limited
Partners without such approval. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, whenever a determination, decision, approval, consent, waiver or
agreement of the Partnership or Partnership GP is required pursuant to this
Agreement (including any determination to exercise or refrain from exercising
any rights under _Article VIII_ or to enforce the terms of this Agreement
(including _Section_ __ _ 9.8_)), such determination, decision, approval,
consent, waiver or agreement must be authorized by the GP Conflicts Committee
(if on behalf of the Partnership), or the GP Board only (if on behalf of the
Partnership GP).

Section 9.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_ _._. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party that is the intended beneficiary of the relevant
provision of this Agreement, may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other Party, (b)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any
other Party, (c) waive compliance by any other Party with any of the
agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any
of such Partys conditions or (d) make or grant any consent under this
Agreement; provided, however, that neither the Partnership nor the Partnership
GP (if acting on behalf of the Partnership, but not if acting on behalf of
itself) shall take or authorize any such action without the prior approval of
the GP Board (after consulting with the GP Conflicts Committee).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Partnership, the
Partnership GP, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of any Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party.

Section 9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except that Parent or Merger Sub may assign, in
its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under

 



41

    

 this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in " _portable
document format_ " (" _.pdf_ ") form, or by any other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper
document bearing the original signature.

Section 9.6 _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement and any certificates delivered by any Party pursuant to this
Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and understanding, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and thereof
and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights
(including third-party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or
remedies hereunder, except for, in the case of clause (b), (i) the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and (ii) subject to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, the
right of the holders of Common Units to receive the Merger Consideration, or
distributions in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.1(h)_ and  _Section_ __ _
6.17_, after the Closing (a claim by the holders of Common Units with respect
to which may not be made unless and until the Closing shall have occurred).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,  _Section_ __ _
9.11_ shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, any financing sources
or lender providing financing in connection with the Merger. Any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are subject
to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the Knowledge of Parent, the Partnership GP or the Partnership. Consequently,
Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

Section 9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of
laws that would result in the application of the Law of a different State.
Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or Proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court
of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the Parties consents to service of process being
made upon it through the notice procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.9_,
irrevocably submits with regard to any such 

 



42

    

 action or Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally
and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid
courts. Each of the Parties irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or Proceeding with respect
to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 9.7_, (ii) any
claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any
such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit,
action or Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B)
the venue of such suit, action or Proceeding is improper or (C) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each Party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver
is intended to be irrevocable under the Law of the State of Delaware and of
the United States of America; provided, however, that each such Partys
consent to jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.7(a)_
is solely for the purposes referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.7(a)_ and
shall not be deemed to be a general submission to such courts or in the State
of Delaware other than for such purposes.

 

(b) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties agrees that
irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder in order to consummate the Merger) in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 9.8_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over such matter, any federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (a) any Party
has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity (it being understood
that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Parties from raising other
defenses to a claim for specific performance or other equitable relief under
this Agreement). Each Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _
9.8_, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of applicable Law or public policy,
all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect

extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that

this Agreement) shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of,
or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ shall limit any liability of the Parties
or the parties to the Support Agreement for breaches of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Support Agreement, as applicable.

Section 9.12  _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_.

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges that Baker Botts L.L.P. has represented
Parent prior to the Closing in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, as well as prior transactions involving
Parent. Each Party, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Other Parties,
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between Parent
and its counsel and information or documents subject to attorney work-product
protection made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of and closing under, or any Proceeding arising under or in
connection with, this Agreement, which, immediately prior to the Closing,
would be deemed to be a privileged communication or subject to attorney work-
product protection and would not be subject to disclosure to any Party or
its Other Parties, shall continue after the Closing to be a privileged
communication between Parent and its counsel or attorney work-product, and
neither a Party, its Other Parties nor anyone acting or purporting to act on
behalf of or through them shall be entitled to use or seek to obtain the same
by any process on the grounds that the privilege attached to such
communication or attorney work-product belongs to such Party or its Other
Parties and not to Parent or its counsel. Any access thereto by a Party or
its Other Parties shall not waive or otherwise affect the rights of Parent
with respect to the related privilege.

 

(b) Each of the Parties acknowledges that Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP
has represented the GP Conflicts Committee prior to the Closing in connection

and agrees that all communications between the GP Conflicts Committee and its
counsel and information or documents subject to attorney work-product
protection made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of and closing under, or any Proceeding arising under or in
connection with, this Agreement, which, immediately prior to the

 



45

    

 Closing, would be deemed to be a privileged communication or subject to
attorney work-product protection and would not be subject to disclosure to any
Party or its Other Parties, shall continue after the Closing to be a
privileged communication between the GP Conflicts Committee and its counsel or
attorney work-product, and neither a Party, its Other Parties nor anyone
acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through them shall be entitled to
use or seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the
privilege attached to such communication or attorney work-product belongs to
such Party or its Other Parties and not to the GP Conflicts Committee or its
counsel. Any access thereto by a Party or its Other Parties shall not waive
or otherwise affect the rights of the GP Conflicts Committee with respect to
the related privilege.
