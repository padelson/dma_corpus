                             ----------------------


         This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of the 4th day of February,
2004 (this "Agreement"),  by and between SouthTrust of Alabama, Inc., an Alabama
corporation  ("ST-Sub"),  and FloridaFirst Bancorp,  Inc., a Florida corporation
("FloridaFirst"),   and  joined  in  by  SouthTrust   Corporation,   a  Delaware
corporation ("SouthTrust") (collectively, the "Parties").

                                WITNESSETH THAT:

         WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of ST-Sub and FloridaFirst
deem it in the best interests of ST-Sub and of FloridaFirst,  respectively,  and
of their respective shareholders, that ST-Sub and FloridaFirst merge pursuant to
this Agreement in a transaction that qualifies as a  reorganization  pursuant to
Section 368 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended,  the "Code") (the
"Merger");  provided,  however,  that the parties have agreed that under certain
circumstances  the  transaction  may be  restructured so as to avoid a corporate
level tax on the transaction,  and in such event, the parties will enter into an
appropriate amendment to the Agreement to reflect such restructuring;


         WHEREAS,  the  Boards of  Directors  of ST-Sub  and  FloridaFirst  have
approved this  Agreement  and have directed that this  Agreement be submitted to
their  respective  shareholders for approval and adoption in accordance with the
laws of the State of Alabama, the State of Florida and the United States;


         WHEREAS,  SouthTrust,  the sole shareholder of ST-Sub, will deliver, or
cause to be delivered,  to the shareholders of FloridaFirst the consideration to
be paid pursuant to the Merger in accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement;
and


         WHEREAS, FloridaFirst owns all the issued and outstanding capital stock
of FloridaFirst Bank, a federal savings bank ("FF-Bank"), and ST-Sub owns all of
the issued and  outstanding  capital stock of SouthTrust  Bank, an Alabama state
banking corporation ("ST-Bank"), and it is contemplated that, in connection with
the  consummation  of this Agreement and pursuant to the

                                       1

<PAGE>

terms of a certain Bank Merger Agreement (the "Bank Merger Agreement"),  FF-Bank
will be merged with and into ST-Bank (the "Bank Merger");


         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises  and  the  mutual
covenants,  representations,  warranties and agreements  herein  contained,  the
parties agree that FloridaFirst will be merged with and into ST-Sub and that the
terms and conditions of the Merger, the mode of carrying the Merger into effect,
including the manner of converting  the shares of common stock of  FloridaFirst,
par value $0.10 per share, into shares of common stock of SouthTrust,  par value
of $2.50 per share, or other consideration shall be as hereinafter set forth.

ARTICLE 1


                                   THE MERGER

         Section 1.1 Consummation of Merger; Closing Date.
                     ------------------------------------

         (a) Subject to the provisions hereof, FloridaFirst shall be merged with
and into ST-Sub (which has  heretofore  and shall  hereinafter be referred to as
the  "Merger")  pursuant to the laws of the States of Alabama and  Florida,  and
ST-Sub shall be the surviving corporation  (sometimes hereinafter referred to as
"Surviving Corporation" when reference is made to it after the Effective Time of
the Merger (as defined  below)).  The Merger shall become  effective on the date
and at the time on which  Articles  of  Merger  have been  duly  filed  with the
Secretaries of State of Alabama and Florida, unless a later date is specified in
such Articles of Merger (such time is hereinafter  referred to as the "Effective
Time of the  Merger").  Subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  hereof,  unless
otherwise agreed upon by SouthTrust and FloridaFirst,  the Effective Time of the
Merger shall occur on the tenth (10th) business day following the later to occur
of (i) the  effective  date  (including  expiration  of any  applicable  waiting
period) of the last  required  Consent  (as  defined  herein) of any  Regulatory
Authority  (as  defined   herein)  having   authority   over  the   transactions
contemplated  under the Merger  Agreement or the Bank Merger  Agreement and (ii)
the date on which the  shareholders  of  FloridaFirst  approve the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or such other time as the parties may agree.

         (b) The closing of the Merger (the  "Closing")  shall take place at the
principal  offices of  FloridaFirst at 10:00 a.m. local time on the day that the
Effective Time of the Merger occurs,  or such other date,  time and place as the
parties hereto may agree (the "Closing Date"). Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Closing there shall be delivered to each of the parties hereto
the opinions, certificates and other documents and instruments required to be so
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

         Section  1.2 Effect of Merger.  At the  Effective  Time of the  Merger,
                      ----------------
FloridaFirst  shall be merged with and into ST-Sub and the separate existence of
FloridaFirst shall cease. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of ST-Sub, as
in effect on the date hereof and as  otherwise  amended  prior to the  Effective
Time of the Merger, shall be the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the
Surviving   Corporation  until  further  amended  as  provided  therein  and  in
accordance  with applicable  law. The Surviving  Corporation  shall have all the
rights, privileges, immunities and powers and shall be subject to all the duties
and  liabilities  of a  corporation

                                       2

organized  under  the laws of the  State of  Alabama  and  shall  thereupon  and
thereafter possess all other privileges, immunities and franchises of a private,
as well as of a public  nature,  of each of the  constituent  corporations.  All
property (real, personal and mixed) and all debts on whatever account, including
subscriptions to shares, and all choses in action, all and every other interest,
of or  belonging  to or due to each of the  constituent  corporations  so merged
shall be taken  and  deemed to be  transferred  to and  vested in the  Surviving
Corporation  without  further act or deed. The title to any real estate,  or any
interest therein, vested in any of the constituent corporations shall not revert
or be in any way  impaired by reason of the Merger.  The  Surviving  Corporation
shall  thenceforth  be  responsible  and  liable  for  all the  liabilities  and
obligations  of each of the  constituent  corporations  so merged  and any claim
existing or action or proceeding pending by or against either of the constituent
corporations  may be  prosecuted  as if the  Merger  had not taken  place or the
Surviving  Corporation  may be substituted  in its place.  Neither the rights of

                   CONVERSION OF CONSTITUENTS' CAPITAL SHARES

         Section 2.1 Manner of Conversion of FloridaFirst Shares. Subject to the
                     -------------------------------------------
provisions  hereof,  as of the Effective Time of the Merger and by virtue of the
Merger  and  without  any  further  action  on the part of  SouthTrust,  ST-Sub,
FloridaFirst or the holder of any shares thereof,  the shares of the constituent
corporations shall be converted as follows:

         (a) Each share of capital stock of ST-Sub outstanding immediately prior
to the  Effective  Time of the Merger  shall,  after the  Effective  Time of the
Merger,  remain outstanding and unchanged and thereafter shall constitute all of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) Each  share of  common  stock of  FloridaFirst  (the  "FloridaFirst
Shares") held by FloridaFirst  or by SouthTrust (or any of their  subsidiaries),
other  than  in  a  fiduciary  capacity  or  as a  result  of  debts  previously
contracted,  shall be canceled and retired and no consideration shall be paid or
delivered in exchange therefor.

                                       3
<PAGE>

         (c) Except  with  regard to: (i)  FloridaFirst  Shares  excluded  under
Section  2.1(b)  above  and (ii)  FloridaFirst  Shares  the  holder of which has
elected to receive the per share cash consideration  provided in Section 2.1(d),
each FloridaFirst  Share outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger shall be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of
common stock of SouthTrust (and the rights associated therewith pursuant to that
certain Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of August 1, 2000 between
SouthTrust  and  American  Stock  Transfer  &  Trust  Company   (together,   the
"SouthTrust  Shares"))  that is equal to the  quotient  obtained by dividing (i)
$146,123,851  plus the product of $27.12 and the number of  FloridaFirst  Shares
issued pursuant to the exercise of  FloridaFirst  Options (as defined in Section
2.2) (the "Total Consideration")  subsequent to the date hereof but prior to the
Effective  Time by (ii) the  product of the Average  Market  Price and the total
number of issued and outstanding  FloridaFirst Shares (exclusive of any treasury
shares) at the Effective Time of the Merger.  (Such number of SouthTrust Shares,
as may be adjusted as provided  herein,  is hereinafter  referred to as the "Per
Share Stock Consideration"). Thereafter, subject to Sections 2.1(d) and 2.3, all
outstanding certificates representing FloridaFirst Shares shall represent solely
the right to receive  SouthTrust  Shares.  Except as may be provided below,  the
"Average  Market  Price"  shall be the average of the closing per share  trading
prices of SouthTrust Shares (adjusted  appropriately for any stock split,  stock
dividend,  recapitalization,  reclassification  or similar  transaction which is
effected,  or for which a record date  occurs) on the twenty (20)  trading  days
preceding  the fifth  trading  day  immediately  prior to the Closing  Date,  as
reported in the Wall Street Journal.

         In the event of an Acquisition Transaction (as defined in Section 10.2)
with respect to SouthTrust which is publicly announced subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and on or before the Effective  Time of the Merger,  the "Average
Market  Price" shall be the average of the closing per share  trading  prices of
SouthTrust  Shares on the twenty (20) trading days  preceding  the fifth trading
day  immediately  prior to the date of this  Agreement,  as reported in the Wall
Street Journal.

         (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.1(c) above, each holder
of FloridaFirst Shares shall be provided with an opportunity to elect to receive
cash consideration for a portion or all of such holder's  FloridaFirst Shares in
lieu of receiving SouthTrust Shares under Section 2.1(c), in accordance with the
election procedures set forth in this Section 2.1(d).

         Holders who elect to receive  cash in lieu of  exchanging  FloridaFirst
Shares for  SouthTrust  Shares as specified  below shall receive  $27.12 in cash
(the "Per Share Cash  Consideration")  for each FloridaFirst Share so converted;
provided,  however,  that in no event shall the  aggregate  amount of cash to be
paid to holders of FloridaFirst Shares in exchange for their FloridaFirst Shares
exceed 49% of the Total Consideration.

               (i)  SouthTrust will use its commercially  reasonable  efforts to

     cause  the  Exchange  Agent  to mail  an  election  form  in  such  form as
     SouthTrust and  FloridaFirst  shall mutually agree (the "Election Form") at
     least 20 days prior to the date of the FloridaFirst  Shareholders'  Meeting
     or on such other date as SouthTrust and  FloridaFirst  shall mutually agree
     (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of FloridaFirst  Shares as of
     the record date for the FloridaFirst  Shareholders'  Meeting. Each Election
     Form

                                       4
<PAGE>

     shall permit a holder (or the  beneficial  owner  through  appropriate  and
     customary  documentation and instructions) of FloridaFirst  Shares to elect
     to  receive  cash  with  respect  to  all or a  portion  of  such  holder's
     FloridaFirst Shares (shares as to which the election is made being referred
     to as "Cash Election Shares").

               (ii) Any FloridaFirst Shares with respect to which the holder (or
     the beneficial  owner,  as the case may be) shall not have submitted to the
     Exchange Agent an effective,  properly completed Election Form on or before
     5:00  p.m.  Eastern  Time  on the  date of the  FloridaFirst  Shareholders'
     Meeting (or such other time and date as  SouthTrust  and  FloridaFirst  may
     mutually  agree)  (the  "Election   Deadline")   shall  be  converted  into
     SouthTrust  Shares as set forth in Section 2.1(c) of this  Agreement  (such
     shares being  referred to as "Exchange  Shares").  Any Election Form may be
     revoked or changed by the person  submitting such Election Form at or prior
     to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to
     the Election Deadline, the FloridaFirst Shares represented by such Election
     Form shall become Exchange  Shares.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement
     and  of the  Election  Form,  the  Exchange  Agent  shall  have  reasonable
     discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
     properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election
     Forms,  and any good faith  decisions of the Exchange Agent  regarding such
     matters  shall  be  binding  and  conclusive.  Neither  SouthTrust  nor the
     Exchange  Agent shall be under any  obligation  to notify any person of any
     defect in an Election Form.

               (iii)Within  three  business  days after the  Election  Deadline,
     unless  the  Effective  Time has not yet  occurred,  in which  case as soon
     thereafter as practicable,  SouthTrust  shall use  commercially  reasonable
     efforts  to cause the  Exchange  Agent to effect the  allocation  among the
     holders of  FloridaFirst  Shares in accordance  with the Election  Forms as
     follows:

                    (A)  Cash  Elections  by No  More  Than  49%  of  the  Total
                         -------------------------------------------------------
                         Consideration. If the amount of cash payable to holders
                         -------------
                         of  FloridaFirst  Shares  electing to receive cash does
                         not  exceed  49% of the Total  Consideration,  then all
                         Cash Election  Shares shall be converted into the right
                         to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and all of
                         the Exchange  Shares shall be converted  into the right
                         to  receive  SouthTrust  Shares,  pursuant  to  Section
                         2.1(c).

                    (B)  Cash   Elections   More   Than   49%   of   the   Total
                         -------------------------------------------------------
                         Consideration.  If the  amount of cash  that  otherwise
                         -------------
                         would be  payable to  holders  of  FloridaFirst  Shares
                         electing to receive  cash would exceed 49% of the Total
                         Consideration, then:

                       (1) the  number  of  Cash  Election Shares designated  by
                           each  holder  of  FloridaFirst  Shares  who  properly
                           submitted a Cash Election Form Shall be automatically
                           reduced to that number of shares

                                       5
<PAGE>

                           equal  to  the  product  of  (A)  49%  of  the  Total
                           Consideration and (B)  a  fraction,  the numerator of
                           which is the number  of such  holder's Cash  Election
                           Shares  designated  in such  holder's Election  Form,
                           and the denominator  of which  is  the  total  number
                           of Cash Election Shares designated  in  all  Election
                           Forms;

                       (2) the  Cash  Election  Shares  that  remain   following
                           proration   under   subsection  (1)  above  shall  be
                           converted into the right to  receive  the  Per  Share
                           Cash Consideration;

                        (3) the  FloridaFirst Shares  that  would have been Cash
                            Election Shares but for the  proration  pursuant  to
                            to  subsection  (1) above  shall  automatically   be
                            deemed to be Exchange Shares; and

                        (4) all  Exchange  Shares  shall  be  converted into the
                            right  to  receive  SouthTrust  Shares, pursuant  to
                            Section 2.1(c).


         Section 2.2 FloridaFirst Stock Options and Related Matters.
                     ----------------------------------------------

         (a) As of the Effective Time of the Merger,  all rights with respect to
FloridaFirst   Shares  issuable  pursuant  to  the  exercise  of  stock  options
("FloridaFirst  Options")  granted  by  FloridaFirst  under  the  1999  and 2002
FloridaFirst Stock Option Plans (the "FloridaFirst Stock Option Plans"), each of
which are listed and described on Schedule  2.2(a) and which are  outstanding at
the Effective Time of the Merger,  shall be canceled as of the Effective Time of
the Merger and shall be converted  into the right to receive in cash, to be paid
by  FloridaFirst  to the option holder at or immediately  prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger,  subject to applicable  withholding  taxes,  the  difference
between (A) $27.12 and (B) the exercise price of each  FloridaFirst  Share under
such  FloridaFirst  Option  as  listed  on  Schedule  2.2 (a)  hereof,  for each
FloridaFirst Share under such FloridaFirst Options.

         (b)  FloridaFirst  shall  procure  from  each  holder  of  FloridaFirst
Options,   and  shall  deliver  to  SouthTrust  at  the  Closing,   an  executed
acknowledgment and receipt of the payments specified in Section 2.2(a).

         (c) At or immediately  prior to the Effective Time, any unvested awards
under the 1999 and 2002  Restricted  Stock Plans,  which awards are described on
Schedule 2.2(c),  shall become earned and non-forfeitable and distributed in the
form of FloridaFirst Shares at or immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger.  Such  FloridaFirst  Shares  shall be deemed  Exchange  Shares and shall
convert  at the  Effective  Time into the right to receive  the Per Share  Stock
Consideration.

         Section 2.3 Fractional Shares.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of
                     -----------------
this Agreement,  each holder of FloridaFirst  Shares  converted  pursuant to the
Merger  who would  otherwise  have been  entitled  to  receive a  fraction  of a
SouthTrust Share (after taking into account all  certificates  delivered by such
holder),  shall receive,  in lieu thereof,  cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional part of such SouthTrust Share, multiplied by the market
value of one SouthTrust  Share at the Effective  Time of the Merger.  The market
value of a SouthTrust Share at the Effective Time of the Merger, as the case may
be, shall be the last sale price of such SouthTrust  Shares,  as reported by The
Nasdaq Stock Market  ("NASDAQ") on the last business day preceding the Effective
Time of the Merger,  as the case may be, or, if the SouthTrust  Shares hereafter
become listed for trading on any national  securities  exchange registered under
the  Exchange  Act,  the  last  sale  price  of such  SouthTrust  Shares  on the
applicable  date as reported on the principal  securities  exchange on which the
SouthTrust  Shares are then listed for trading.  No such holder will be entitled
to dividends,  voting rights or any other rights as a shareholder  in respect of
any fractional share.

         Section 2.4 Effectuating Conversion.
                     -----------------------

         (a) American Stock Transfer & Trust Company,  or such other third party
institution as SouthTrust and ST-Bank may designate, shall serve as the exchange
agent (the  "Exchange  Agent").  The  Exchange  Agent may employ  sub-agents  in
connection with  performing its duties.  As of the Effective Time of the Merger,
SouthTrust  will  deliver or cause to be  delivered  to the  Exchange  Agent the
consideration to be paid by SouthTrust for FloridaFirst  Shares,  along with the
appropriate cash payment in lieu of fractional  interests in SouthTrust  Shares.
Not later than three business days after the Effective  Time of the Merger,  the
Exchange Agent shall send or cause to be sent to each former holder of record of
FloridaFirst Shares transmittal  materials (the "Letter of Transmittal") for use
in exchanging their certificates formerly  representing  FloridaFirst Shares for
the consideration provided for in this Agreement. The Letter of Transmittal will
contain instructions with respect to the surrender of certificates  representing
FloridaFirst  Shares and the receipt of the  consideration  contemplated by this
Agreement and will require each holder of  FloridaFirst  Shares to transfer good
and marketable title to such FloridaFirst  Shares to SouthTrust,  free and clear
of all liens, claims and encumbrances.

         (b) At the Effective  Time of the Merger,  the stock  transfer books of
FloridaFirst  shall be closed as to holders of FloridaFirst  Shares  immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and no transfer of FloridaFirst Shares
by any such holder shall  thereafter be made or recognized and each  outstanding
certificate formerly representing  FloridaFirst Shares shall, without any action
on the part of any holder thereof, no longer represent  FloridaFirst Shares. If,
after the Effective Time of the Merger,  certificates are properly  presented to
the Exchange Agent, such  certificates  shall be exchanged for the consideration
contemplated  by this  Agreement  into  which  FloridaFirst  Shares  represented
thereby were converted in the Merger.

         (c) In the event that any holder of record as of the Effective  Time of
the Merger of  FloridaFirst  Shares is unable to deliver the  certificate  which
represents  such holder's  FloridaFirst  Shares,  SouthTrust,  in the absence of
actual notice that any FloridaFirst  Shares theretofore  represented by any such
certificate have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser,

                                       7
<PAGE>

may, in its discretion, deliver to such holder the consideration contemplated by
this Agreement and the amount of cash representing  fractional SouthTrust Shares
to which such holder is  entitled  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this
Agreement upon the presentation of all of the following:

          (i)  An affidavit or other evidence to the reasonable  satisfaction of
     SouthTrust  that any such  certificate has been lost,  wrongfully  taken or
     destroyed;

          (ii) Such  security or  indemnity  as may be  reasonably  requested by
     SouthTrust  to indemnify  and hold  SouthTrust  harmless in respect of such
     stock certificate(s); and

          (iii) Evidence to the satisfaction  of SouthTrust  that such holder is
     the  owner  of  FloridaFirst   Shares   theretofore   represented  by  each
     certificate  claimed  by  such  holder  to be  lost,  wrongfully  taken  or
     destroyed  and that such  holder is the  person  who would be  entitled  to
     present each such certificate for exchange pursuant to this Agreement.

         (d) In the event that the delivery of the consideration contemplated by
this Agreement and the amount of cash representing  fractional SouthTrust Shares
are to be made to a person  other than the person in whose name any  certificate
representing FloridaFirst Shares surrendered is registered,  such certificate so
surrendered  shall  be  properly  endorsed  (or  accompanied  by an  appropriate
instrument of transfer),  with the signature(s)  appropriately  guaranteed,  and
otherwise in proper form for transfer,  and the person  requesting such delivery
shall pay any  transfer or other taxes  required by reason of the  delivery to a
person  other than the  registered  holder of such  certificate  surrendered  or
establish to the  satisfaction  of SouthTrust  that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable.

         (e) No holder of  FloridaFirst  Shares shall be entitled to receive any
dividends  or  distributions  declared  or made with  respect to the  SouthTrust
Shares with a record date before the Effective  Time of the Merger.  Neither the
consideration  contemplated by this Agreement,  any amount of cash  representing
fractional SouthTrust Shares nor any dividend or other distribution with respect
to SouthTrust  Shares where the record date thereof is on or after the Effective
Time of the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered  certificate
or certificates  representing  FloridaFirst  Shares, and SouthTrust shall not be
obligated to deliver any of the  consideration  contemplated  by this Agreement,
any  amount  of cash  representing  fractional  SouthTrust  Shares  or any  such
dividend or other  distribution  with  respect to  SouthTrust  Shares until such
holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates representing FloridaFirst
Shares as provided for by the Agreement.  Subject to applicable laws,  following
surrender of any such  certificate or  certificates,  there shall be paid to the
holder of the certificate or certificates  then  representing  SouthTrust Shares
issued  in the  Merger,  without  interest  at the time of such  surrender,  the
consideration   contemplated  by  this   Agreement,   the  amount  of  any  cash
representing  fractional  SouthTrust  Shares and the amount of any  dividends or
other  distributions  with respect to SouthTrust  Shares to which such holder is
entitled as a holder of SouthTrust Shares.

               Section  2.5 Laws of Escheat. (a) If any of the consideration due
                            ---------------
or other payments to be paid or delivered to the holders of FloridaFirst  Shares
is not paid or delivered within the time period specified by any applicable laws
concerning  abandoned property,  escheat or similar laws, and if such failure to
pay or  deliver  such  consideration  occurs or arises out of the fact that such
property is not claimed by the proper owner thereof,  SouthTrust or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to dispose of any such  consideration  or other payments
in accordance with applicable laws  concerning  abandoned  property,  escheat or
similar laws.  Any other  provision of this Agreement  notwithstanding,  none of
FloridaFirst, SouthTrust, ST-Sub, the Exchange Agent, or any other Person acting
on their  behalf  shall be  liable to a holder of  FloridaFirst  Shares  for any
amount paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
and in accordance  with any applicable  abandoned  property,  escheat or similar
law.

duly licensed or qualified to do business in all such places where the nature of
the business  conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it make such qualification necessary, except where the

         Section 3.11 Taxes and Tax Returns.
                      ---------------------

         (a)  FloridaFirst  has  previously   delivered  or  made  available  to
SouthTrust  copies of the  federal,  state  and  local  income  tax  returns  of
FloridaFirst  and,  if  consolidated  returns do not exist for all  periods,  of
FF-Bank and each of its respective  subsidiaries,  for the years 2001,  2002 and
2003 and all  schedules  and  exhibits  thereto,  and,  except as  disclosed  in
Schedule  3.11,  such  returns have not been  examined by the  Internal  Revenue
Service or any other taxing  authority.  Except as  reflected in Schedule  3.11,
FloridaFirst and FF-Bank have duly filed in correct form all federal,  state and
local  information  returns and tax returns  required to be filed on or prior to
the date hereof,  and  FloridaFirst  and FF-Bank have duly paid or made adequate
provisions for the payment of all taxes and other governmental charges which are
owed  by  FloridaFirst  and  FF-Bank  to any  federal,  state  or  local  taxing

limitation,  those owed in respect of the properties,  income, business, capital
stock, deposits,  franchises,  licenses,  sales and payrolls of FloridaFirst and
FF-Bank), other than taxes and other charges which (i) are not yet delinquent or
are being contested in good faith or (ii) have not been finally determined.  The
amounts  set forth as  liabilities  for  taxes on the  Financial  Statements  of
FloridaFirst and the Financial Regulatory Reports of FF-Bank are sufficient,  in
the  aggregate,  for the  payment of all unpaid  federal,  state and local taxes
(including any interest or penalties thereon),  whether or not disputed, accrued
or applicable,  for the periods then ended, and have been computed in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.  Neither FloridaFirst nor FF-Bank
is  responsible  for the taxes of any other  person other than  FloridaFirst  or
FF-Bank, under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of federal,
state or foreign law.

         (b) Except as  disclosed in Schedule  3.11,  neither  FloridaFirst  nor
FF-Bank has executed an extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the
assessment  or  collection  of any  federal,  state or local  taxes  due that is
currently in effect,  and deferred taxes of FloridaFirst  or FF-Bank,  have been
adequately provided for in the Financial Statements of FloridaFirst.

         (c) Except as  disclosed in Schedule  3.11,  neither  FloridaFirst  nor
FF-Bank has made any payment,  is obligated to make any payment or is a party to
any contract,  agreement or other arrangement that could obligate it to make any
payment that would be disallowed as a deduction  under Section 280G or 162(m) of
the Code.

         (d) There has not been an  ownership  change,  as  defined  in  Section
382(g) of the Code, of FloridaFirst or FF-Bank that occurred during or after any

carries over to any taxable period ending after the fiscal year of  FloridaFirst
immediately preceding the date of this Agreement.

         (e) (i) Proper and accurate  amounts have been withheld by FloridaFirst
and FF-Bank from their  employees and others for all prior periods in compliance
in all material  respects with the tax withholding  provisions of all applicable
federal,  state and local laws and  regulations,  and proper due diligence steps
have been taken in connection with back-up withholding;  (ii) federal, state and
local  returns have been filed by  FloridaFirst  and FF-Bank for all periods for
which  returns  were  due with  respect  to  withholding,  Social  Security  and
unemployment  taxes  or  charges  due to any  federal,  state  or  local  taxing
authority;  and (iii) the

                                       15

         Section 3.12 Employee Benefit Plans.
                      ----------------------

         (a)  Neither  FloridaFirst  nor  FF-Bank  or  any of  their  respective
subsidiaries has or maintains any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(3)  of the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act of  1974,  as  amended
("ERISA"),  except as  described  in Schedule  3.12(a)  (the  "Employee  Benefit
Plans").  FloridaFirst and FF-Bank and their respective  subsidiaries have, with
respect to each such plan,  delivered to SouthTrust true and complete copies of:
(i) all current  plan texts and  agreements  and  related  trust  agreements  or
annuity  contracts and any  amendments  thereto;  (ii) all current  summary plan
descriptions and material employee communications;  (iii) the Form 5500 filed in
each of the most recent three plan years  (including  all schedules  thereto and
the  opinions  of  independent  accountants);  (iv)  the most  recent  actuarial
valuation (if any);  (v) the most recent annual and periodic  accounting of plan
assets;  (vi) if the plan is intended to qualify under Section  401(a) or 403(a)
of the Code,  the most recent  determination  letter  received from the Internal
Revenue  Service;  and (vii) all material  communications  with any governmental
entity  or agency  (including,  without  limitation,  the  Department  of Labor,
Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC")).

         (b) Except as described in Schedule  3.12(b),  no Employee Benefit Plan
is a defined benefit plan. Neither FloridaFirst nor FF-Bank (or any pension plan
maintained  by either of them) has  incurred  any  liability  to the PBGC or the
Internal  Revenue  Service  with  respect to any pension  plan  qualified  under
Section 401 of the Code, except liabilities to the PBGC pursuant to Section 4007
of ERISA,  all which have been fully paid.  No  reportable  event under  Section
4043(b) of ERISA (including  events waived by PBGC regulation) has occurred with
respect to any such pension plan.

         (c)  Neither   FloridaFirst  nor  FF-Bank  has  incurred  any  material
liability under Section 4201 of ERISA for a complete or partial withdrawal from,
or agreed to participate in, any multi-employer  plan as such term is defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA.

         (d) All Employee Benefit Plans comply, in all material  respects,  with
the  applicable  provisions  of ERISA and the Code that are  applicable to them,
including,  but not limited to, COBRA,  HIPAA and any applicable,  similar state
law. Neither  FloridaFirst nor FF-Bank has any material liability under any such
plan that is not reflected in the Financial  Statements of  FloridaFirst  or the
Financial Regulatory Reports of FloridaFirst and FF-Bank.  Neither FloridaFirst,
FF-Bank,  any Employee  Benefit Plan nor any  employee,  administrator  or agent
thereof,  is or has been in  violation of the  transaction  code set rules under
HIPAA  ss.ss.  1172-1174  or the HIPAA  privacy  rules under 45 CFR Part 160 and
subparts A and E of Part 164. No penalties  have been  imposed on  FloridaFirst,
FF-Bank,  any Employee  Benefit Plan, or any  employee,  administrator  or agent
thereof, under HIPAA ss. 1176 or ss. 1177.

                                       16
<PAGE>

         For purposes of this Agreement,  "COBRA" means the provision of Section
4980B of the Code and the regulations  thereunder,  and Part 6 of the Subtitle B
of title I of ERISA  and any  regulations  thereunder,  and  "HIPAA"  means  the
provisions of the Code and ERISA as enacted by the Health Insurance  Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996.

         (e)  No  prohibited  transaction  (which  shall  mean  any  transaction
prohibited  by Section 406 of ERISA and not exempt  under  Section 408 of ERISA)
has occurred with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan (i) which would result in
the imposition,  directly or indirectly,  of a material excise tax under Section
4975 of the Code or a material civil penalty under Section  502(i) of ERISA,  or
(ii) the  correction  of which  would  have a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on the
Condition of FloridaFirst  on a consolidated  basis and no actions have occurred
which could result in the imposition of a penalty under any section or provision
of ERISA.

         (f) No Employee  Benefit Plan which is a defined  benefit  pension plan
has any  "unfunded  current  liability,"  as that  term is  defined  in  Section
302(d)(8)(A)  of ERISA,  and the present  fair market value of the assets of any
such plan exceeds the plan's "benefit  liabilities,"  as that term is defined in
Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA, when determined under actuarial factors that would
apply  if  the  plan  terminated  in  accordance   with  all  applicable   legal
requirements.

         (g) Except as described in Schedule 3.12(g),  neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will (i) result in any material payment  (including,  without limitation,
severance,  unemployment  compensation,  golden parachute or otherwise) becoming
due to any director or any officer or employee of  FloridaFirst or FF-Bank under
any Employee  Benefit Plan or otherwise,  (ii) materially  increase any benefits
otherwise  payable under any benefit plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits to any material extent.

         (h) No  Employee  Benefit  Plan is a  multiemployer  plan as defined in
Section 414(f) of the Code or Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. FloridaFirst
and FF-Bank have never been a party to or participant in a multiemployer plan.

         (i) There are no  actions,  liens,  suits or claims  pending or, to the
knowledge of FloridaFirst,  threatened  (other than routine claims for benefits)
with respect to any Employee  Benefit Plan or against the assets of any Employee
Benefit Plan. No assets of FloridaFirst or FF-Bank are subject to any lien under
Section 302(f) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code.

         (j) Each  Employee  Benefit  Plan which is  intended  to qualify  under
Section  401(a) or 403(a) of the Code has  received  a  favorable  determination
letter from the Internal  Revenue Service to the effect that it so qualifies and
its related trust is exempt from taxation  under Section  501(a) of the Code. No
event has  occurred  or  circumstance  exists  that will or could give rise to a
disqualification or loss of tax-exempt status of any such plan or trust.

         (k) No Employee  Benefit  Plan is a multiple  employer  plan within the
meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code or Section 4063, 4064 or 4066 of ERISA. No
Employee Benefit Plan is a multiple  employer welfare  arrangement as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA.

         (l) Each employee  pension  benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA , that is not  qualified  under  Section  401(a)  or 403(a) of the Code is
exempt  from  Part 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as an  unfunded  plan  that is
maintained  primarily for the purpose of providing  deferred  compensation for a
select group of management or highly compensated employees,  pursuant to Section
201(2),  301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.  No assets of FloridaFirst or FF-Bank
are allocated to or held in a "rabbi trust" or similar funding vehicle.

         (m) Except as set forth on Schedule  3.12(m),  no Employee Benefit Plan
provides  benefits to any current or former  employee of FloridaFirst or FF-Bank
beyond  retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage mandated
by COBRA,  the cost of which is fully paid by the current or former  employee or
his or her dependents).

         (n)  Except as set forth on  Schedule  3.12(n),  with  respect  to each
Employee  Benefit  Plan,  there  are no  funded  benefit  obligations  for which
contributions  have not been made or properly  accrued and there are no unfunded
benefit  obligations  that have not been  accounted for by reserves or otherwise
shown  in  the  footnotes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles to the Financial Statements of FloridaFirst.

their respective  subsidiaries  leases,  subleases or licenses  material real or
material personal  properties from others are valid,  binding and enforceable in
accordance  with their  respective  terms,  and there is not,  under any of such
leases or licenses, any existing default or event of default, or any event which
with  notice or lapse of time,  or both,  would  constitute  a default  or force

nonperformance, except for defaults which individually or in the aggregate would
not have a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on the  Condition  of  FloridaFirst  on a
consolidated  basis.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.13(b),  FloridaFirst and
FF-Bank  have all right,  title and interest as a lessee under the terms of each
lease or sublease,  free and clear of all liens,  claims or encumbrances  (other

lessor)  as of the  Effective  Time of the  Merger,  and shall have the right to
transfer each lease or sublease pursuant to this Agreement.

         (c)  Other  than  real  estate  that was  acquired  by  foreclosure  or
voluntary deed in lieu of foreclosure  (i) all of the buildings,  structures and
fixtures  owned,  leased  or  subleased  by  FloridaFirst,   FF-Bank  and  their

         (a) For so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect,  FloridaFirst
and FF-Bank shall permit SouthTrust or its agents upon prior notice full access,
during normal business hours, to the properties of FloridaFirst and FF-Bank, and
shall disclose and make  available to SouthTrust  and to its internal  auditors,
loan review  officers,  attorneys,  accountants and other  representatives,  all
books, papers and records relating to the assets, stock, properties, operations,
obligations and  liabilities of FloridaFirst or FF-Bank,  including all books of
account (including the general ledger), tax records,  minute books of directors'
(excluding  matters relating to the  consideration and approval of the Agreement
and the Merger, any "Acquisition Proposal" or "takeover proposal" (as such terms
are  defined  herein) or the  fiduciary  duties of the board) and  shareholders'
meetings,  organizational documents,  bylaws, contracts and agreements,  filings
with any regulatory agency, examination reports,  correspondence with regulatory
or  taxing  authorities,   documents  relating  to  assets,  titles,  abstracts,
appraisals, consultant's reports, plans affecting employees, securities transfer
records and  stockholder  lists,  and any other assets,  business  activities or
prospects in which SouthTrust may have a reasonable interest,  and FloridaFirst,
FF-Bank  and their  respective  subsidiaries  shall use  their  reasonable  best
efforts to provide SouthTrust and its representatives  access to the work papers
of FloridaFirst's  and FloridaFirst  subsidiaries'  accountants.  For so long as
this Agreement  shall remain in effect,  FloridaFirst  shall permit a SouthTrust
representative to attend FloridaFirst board meetings provided that the board may
convene  in   executive   session   without  the   presence   of  a   SouthTrust
representative.  FloridaFirst,  FF-Bank and their respective  subsidiaries shall
not be  required  to provide  access to or to  disclose  information  where such
access or  disclosure  would  violate or prejudice  the rights of any  customer,
would  contravene any law, rule,  regulation,  order or judgment,  would destroy
attorney-client  privilege  or  would  violate  any  confidentiality  agreement;
provided  that  FloridaFirst  and FF-Bank  shall  cooperate  with  SouthTrust in
seeking to obtain  Consents  from  appropriate  parties  under  whose  rights or
authority  access is  otherwise  restricted.  The  foregoing  rights  granted to
SouthTrust  shall not,  whether or not and regardless of the extent to which the
same are  exercised,  affect the  representations  and  warranties  made in this
Agreement by FloridaFirst, FF-Bank and their respective subsidiaries.

         (b) All  information  furnished by the parties hereto  pursuant to this
Agreement  shall be treated as the sole  property  of the party  providing  such
information  until the  consummation of the Merger  contemplated  hereby and, if
such  transaction  shall not occur,  the party receiving the  information  shall
return to the party which  furnished  such  information,  all documents or other
materials containing, reflecting or referring to such information, shall use its
best efforts to keep confidential all such  information,  and shall not directly
or indirectly  use such  information  for any  competitive  or other  commercial
purposes.  The obligation to keep such information  confidential  shall continue
for two (2) years from the date the  proposed  transactions  are  abandoned  but
shall  not  apply to (1) any  information  which  (A) the  party  receiving  the

                                       34
<PAGE>

information  was already in  possession  of prior to  disclosure  thereof by the
party furnishing the information,  (B) was then available to the public,  or (C)
became  available  to the  public  through no fault of the party  receiving  the
information; or (2) disclosures pursuant to a legal requirement or in accordance
with an  order  of a court  of  competent  jurisdiction  or  regulatory  agency;
provided,  however, the party which is the subject of any such legal requirement
or order  shall use its best  efforts to give the other  party at least ten (10)
business days prior notice thereof.  Each party hereto  acknowledges  and agrees
that a breach of any of their  respective  obligations  under this  Section  5.3
would cause the other  irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at
law, and that,  accordingly,  each is entitled to injunctive and other equitable
relief for the  enforcement  thereof in addition to damages or any other  relief
available at law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit the disclosure of the tax treatment and tax  structure,  as those terms
are  used  in  Treasury   Regulation  Section  1.6011-4,   of  the  transactions
contemplated by the Agreement from and after the date of the public announcement
by the Parties of this Agreement and the Merger.

         (c) From and after the date hereof,  FloridaFirst  shall cause  FF-Bank
and its  directors,  officers and  employees  to, and shall make all  reasonable
efforts to cause FF-Bank's data processing  service  providers to, cooperate and
assist SouthTrust in connection with an electronic and systematic  conversion of
all applicable  data regarding  FF-Bank to ST-Bank's  system of electronic  data
processing.  In  furtherance  of,  and  not in  limitation  of,  the  foregoing,
FloridaFirst shall cause FF-Bank to make reasonable  arrangements  during normal
business  hours to permit  personnel  and  representatives  of  ST-Bank to train
FF-Bank employees in ST-Bank's system of electronic data processing.

and hold a meeting of its shareholders at such time as may be mutually agreed to
by the parties for the purpose of approving this Agreement and the  transactions
contemplated  hereby and for such other  purposes  consistent  with the complete
performance of this  Agreement as may be necessary or desirable.  Subject to its
fiduciary  duties,  the Board of Directors of FloridaFirst will recommend to its
shareholders  the approval of this Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated
hereby  and  FloridaFirst  will use its best  efforts  to obtain  the  necessary
approvals  by  its   shareholders   of  this  Agreement  and  the   transactions
contemplated hereby.

initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making
of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any "takeover proposal" (as defined below) by any other party. Except to the
extent necessary to comply with the fiduciary duties of FloridaFirst's  Board of
Directors  taking into account the advice of counsel to such Board of Directors,
neither  FloridaFirst nor any affiliate or representative  thereof shall furnish
any  non-public  information  that it is not  legally  obligated  to  furnish or
negotiate or enter into any  agreement or contract  with respect to any takeover

affiliates  or  representatives  not to  engage  in any  of the  foregoing,  but
FloridaFirst may communicate  information  about such a takeover proposal to its
shareholders  if and to the  extent it is  required  to do so in order to comply
with its legal  obligations as advised by counsel.  FloridaFirst  shall promptly
notify  SouthTrust  orally  and in writing  in the event  that it  receives  any
inquiry  or  proposal  relating  to any  such  transaction.  FloridaFirst  shall
immediately  cease and cause to be terminated  as of the date of this  Agreement
any existing  activities,  discussions  or  negotiations  with any other parties
conducted  heretofore  with  respect  to any of the  foregoing.  As used in this
Section 5.5,  "takeover  proposal" shall mean any proposal for a merger or other
business combination involving FloridaFirst,  FF-Bank or any of their respective
subsidiaries  or  for  the  acquisition  of a  significant  equity  interest  in
FloridaFirst,  FF-Bank  or any  of  their  respective  subsidiaries  or for  the

                     ----------------------------------------

         (a) The parties  acknowledge  that nothing in this  Agreement  shall be
construed as constituting an employment  agreement between  SouthTrust or any of
its  affiliates and any officer or employee of  FloridaFirst,  FF-Bank or any of
their respective  subsidiaries or an obligation on the part of SouthTrust or any
of its affiliates to employ any such officers or employees.

         (b) The  parties  agree  that  appropriate  steps  shall  be  taken  to
terminate the FloridaFirst Bank 401(k) Retirement Plan (the "FloridaFirst 401(k)

FloridaFirst  401(k) Plan and  distribute  the assets of its trust in accordance

employees of FloridaFirst,  FF-Bank or any of their respective  subsidiaries who
were participating  immediately prior to the Merger in employee benefit plans of
FloridaFirst,  FF-Bank or any of their respective  subsidiaries  (other than the
FloridaFirst  401(k) Plan) for which SouthTrust  maintains a corresponding  plan
shall commence  participation in SouthTrust's  corresponding plan upon the later
of the Effective Time of the Merger or the date of termination of coverage under
the Employee Benefit Plans of  FloridaFirst,  FF-Bank or any of

                                       39
<PAGE>

(including any gap affecting any of FloridaFirst employee's dependents), whether
a gap in time of  coverage  or in waiting  or  elimination  periods.  Subject to
Section  6.3(c)  hereof and except as  otherwise  specifically  provided  below,
SouthTrust  agrees that the officers and employees of  FloridaFirst,  FF-Bank or
any of their respective  subsidiaries who SouthTrust or its subsidiaries  employ
shall be  eligible  to  participate  in  SouthTrust's  employee  benefit  plans,
including  welfare and fringe benefit plans, sick leave,  vacation,  holiday pay

conditions  as  are  applicable  to  any  newly-hired  employee  of  SouthTrust;
provided, however, that:

               (i)  with  respect to each  SouthTrust  Health  Plan,  SouthTrust
                    shall  credit  each  such  employee  for  eligible  expenses
                    incurred  by such  employee  and his or her  dependents  (if
                    applicable)  under  the  group  medical  insurance  plan  of
                    FloridaFirst,   FF-Bank   or   any   of   their   respective
                    subsidiaries  during the current  calendar year for purposes
                    of satisfying the deductible  provisions under  SouthTrust's
                    plan for such current year, and  SouthTrust  shall waive all
                    waiting   periods   under   said   plans  for   pre-existing
                    conditions; and

               (ii) Credit  for  each  such   employee's   past   service   with
                    FloridaFirst,   FF-Bank   or   any   of   their   respective
                    subsidiaries  prior  to the  Effective  Time  of the  Merger
                    ("Past  Service  Credit")  shall be given by  SouthTrust  to
                    employees for purposes of:

                    (A)  determining vacation,  severance,  sick leave and other
                         leave  benefits and accruals,  in  accordance  with the
                         established  policies of SouthTrust;

                    (B)  establishing   eligibility  for  participation  in  and
                         vesting under  SouthTrust's  welfare and fringe benefit
                         plans,  and for purposes of determining  the scheduling
                         of vacations  and other  determinations  which are made
                         based on length of service.

         (c) From and after the  Applicable  Date (as  hereinafter  defined) and
subject  to  applicable  law,  SouthTrust  shall  recognize  the  service of all

                                       40
<PAGE>

                         SouthTrust  and all service  performed  for  SouthTrust
                         from and after the  Effective  Time of the Merger shall
                         be credited; and

                    (ii) for  purposes of benefit  accrual  under the ST Pension

         (d) Consistent with Section 6.3(b) of this Agreement, the parties agree
that  appropriate  steps will be taken to terminate  the  FloridaFirst  Employee
Stock  Ownership  Plan (the "FF-Bank  ESOP") as of a date prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger. FF-Bank, as sponsor of the FF-Bank ESOP, agrees that as soon
as  administratively   feasible  following  the  execution  of  this  Agreement,
independent legal counsel ("FF-Bank ESOP Counsel") for the FF-Bank ESOP Trustees
(the  "Trustees")  shall be appointed to advise the Trustees  with regard to the
exercise,   in  connection  with  the  proposed  Merger,   of  their  power  and
responsibility  to  vote  unallocated  FloridaFirst  Shares  held  by the  trust
associated  with the FF-Bank  ESOP (the  "FF-Bank  ESOP  Trust")  and  allocated
FloridaFirst Shares held by the FF-Bank ESOP Trust for which no voting direction
has been received and their powers and responsibilities  with respect to Section
2.1(d) of this  Agreement.  The parties  agree that,  following the later of the
termination of the FF-Bank ESOP and receipt of a favorable  determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service relating to such termination, the FF-Bank ESOP
Trustees in coordination with SouthTrust shall take appropriate steps as soon as
practicable  to wind up the FF-Bank ESOP and  distribute the assets of its trust
in accordance with the terms of the FF-Bank ESOP and applicable  law.  Moreover,
the parties agree that as soon as  practicable  following the Effective  Time of
the Merger,  by means of a process  conducted  in a manner  consistent  with the
requirements  of the  Code,  ERISA,  other  applicable  law and the terms of the
FF-Bank ESOP, any existing  liability of the FF-Bank ESOP  collateralized on the
Closing Date with employer stock (currently  FloridaFirst  Shares) shall be paid
off by the FF-Bank ESOP either through application of any cash proceeds received
from the sale of any  unallocated  shares  pursuant  to  Section  2.1(d) of this
Agreement or the proceeds  from the sale of a  sufficient  amount of  SouthTrust
Shares which,  incident to the Merger,  have been  substituted as the collateral
for such  liabilities;  the parties

                                       41
<PAGE>

further agree subject to the requirements of the Code,  ERISA,  other applicable
law and the terms of the FF-Bank  ESOP,  that any residual sale proceeds and any
residual  unallocated  SouthTrust Shares pledged with respect to the liabilities
paid  incident  to such sale shall be  allocated  after  payment of  permissible
administrative and Trustee expenses (which shall include, but not be limited to,
the expenses  associated  with FF-Bank ESOP  Counsel) as earnings to the account
balances of the participants,  alternate payees, or beneficiaries of the FF-Bank
ESOP.

         (e) Deferred Compensation Plans.

               (i)  Upon   SouthTrust's   prior  approval  and  upon  terms  and
          conditions satisfactory to SouthTrust,  FloridaFirst and FF-Bank shall
          use their best efforts to terminate the  FloridaFirst  Bank  Directors
          Consultation  and Retirement Plan (the "Director  Plan") and cause all
          benefits payable to participants under the Director Plan to be paid to
          such participants as of a date no later than the Closing Date.

               (ii) Upon  prior   approval   and  upon   terms  and   conditions
          satisfactory to SouthTrust,  FloridaFirst  and FF-Bank shall use their
          best efforts to terminate the FloridaFirst Bank Supplemental Executive
          Retirement  Plan for the Benefit of Senior  Officers,  as of a date no
          later than the Closing Date.

         Section 6.4 Indemnification.
                     ---------------

         (a) For a period of five (5)  years  after  the  Effective  Time of the
Merger,  SouthTrust  shall  indemnify,  defend  and hold  harmless  each  person
entitled to  indemnification  from  FloridaFirst  (each an "Indemnified  Party")
against all liability arising out of actions or omissions  occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger (including, without limitation, transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) to the same extent and subject to the conditions
set  forth  in   FloridaFirst's   and  FF-Bank's   Articles  or  Certificate  of
Incorporation or Bylaws, in each case as in effect as of the date hereof.

         (b) After the  Effective  Time of the Merger,  directors,  officers and
employees of FloridaFirst  and FF-Bank,  except for the  indemnification  rights
provided for in this Section 6.4 above, shall have indemnification rights having
prospective  application  only. These prospective  indemnification  rights shall
consist of such rights to which directors,  officers and employees of SouthTrust
and its  subsidiaries  would be  entitled  under  the  Restated  Certificate  or
Certificate  or  Articles  of  Incorporation  and  Bylaws of  SouthTrust  or the
particular  subsidiary  for which they are  serving as  officers,  directors  or
employees and under such directors' and officers'  liability insurance policy as
SouthTrust  may then make  available to  officers,  directors  and  employees of
SouthTrust and its subsidiaries.

         (c)  SouthTrust  shall use its best  efforts  (and  FloridaFirst  shall
cooperate prior to the Effective Time of the Merger) to maintain in effect for a
period of five (5) years after the Effective  Time of the Merger  FloridaFirst's
existing  directors' and officers'  liability  insurance  policy  (provided that
SouthTrust  may  substitute  therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts  containing  terms and conditions  which are  substantially  no less
advantageous  or  (ii)with  the  consent  of  FloridaFirst  (given  prior to the
Effective  Time of the Merger) any other

                                       42
<PAGE>

policy with respect to claims  arising from facts or events which occurred prior
to the  Effective  Time of the Merger and  covering  persons  who are  currently
covered by such insurance;  provided,  that SouthTrust shall not be obligated to
make  premium  payments  for such five (5) year period in respect of such policy
(or coverage  replacing  such policy) which exceed,  for the portion  related to
FloridaFirst's and FF-Bank's directors and officers,  150% of the annual premium
payments on  FloridaFirst's  current policy, as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Maximum Amount").  If the amount of premium that is necessary to
maintain  or  procure  such  insurance  coverage  exceeds  the  Maximum  Amount,
SouthTrust  shall use its reasonable  efforts to maintain the most  advantageous
policies of  director's  and  officer's  liability  insurance  obtainable  for a
premium equal to the Maximum Amount.

         (d) If SouthTrust or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other  person and shall not be  continuing  or  surviving
person of such  consolidation or merger,  or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any person, then, and in each case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the  successors  and  assigns  of  SouthTrust  shall  assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.

         (e) The  provisions  of this  Section  6.4 are  intended  to be for the
benefit  of,  and  shall be  enforceable  by each  Indemnified  Party,  and each
Indemnified Party's heirs and representatives.

         Section 6.5 Registration Statement.  Within 60 days of the date of this
                     ----------------------
Agreement,  SouthTrust  shall cause the  Registration  Statement to be filed and
shall use its best efforts to cause such  Registration  Statement to be declared
effective under the Securities Act, which Registration Statement, at the time it
becomes  effective,  and at the  Effective  Time  of the  Merger,  shall  in all
material  respects  conform to the  requirements  of the  Securities Act and the
general  rules  and   regulations  of  the  SEC  promulgated   thereunder.   The
Registration Statement shall include the form of Proxy Statement for the meeting
of  FloridaFirst's  shareholders  to be held  for the  purpose  of  having  such
shareholders vote upon the approval of this Agreement. FloridaFirst, FF-Bank and
their  respective  subsidiaries  will  furnish  to  SouthTrust  the  information
required  to be  included  in the  Registration  Statement  with  respect to its
business  and  affairs  before  it is filed  with the SEC and again  before  any
amendments  are filed and before the Proxy  Statement is mailed to  FloridaFirst
shareholders.  SouthTrust  shall take all actions  required to qualify or obtain
exemptions from such  qualifications  for the SouthTrust  Shares to be issued in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under applicable
state blue sky securities laws, as appropriate.

         Section  7.2  Regulatory  Approvals.  All  necessary  Consents  of  the
                       ---------------------

legality of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement,  or (ii) seeking damages in connection with the  transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement,  or (iii) seeking to restrain or invalidate the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  which, in the case of (i) through
(iii),  and in the  reasonable  judgment of either  SouthTrust or  FloridaFirst,
based upon advice of counsel,  would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect

from  registration  requirements,  as may be necessary  to issue the  SouthTrust
Shares pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

                       ------------
received  an  opinion  of  SouthTrust's  legal  counsel,  in form and  substance
satisfactory to FloridaFirst and to SouthTrust, substantially to the effect that
the Merger will  constitute a  reorganization  under Section 368 of the Code and
that the shareholders of FloridaFirst will not recognize any gain or loss to the
extent that such shareholders  exchange their FloridaFirst Shares for SouthTrust
Shares.  Each of  SouthTrust  and  FloridaFirst  shall upon request  execute and
deliver to such counsel a  certificate  or  certificates  setting  forth factual
matters necessary to form the basis for such opinions.

Effective  Time of the Merger  except to the  extent  such  representations  and
warranties  are by their  express  provisions  made as of a  specified  date and

correct  unless the failure or failures of such  representations  to be true and
correct,  either  individually  or in the aggregate and without giving effect to
any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such
representations  or  warranties,  will  have or is  reasonably  likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of FloridaFirst on a consolidated basis
or the Condition of the Surviving Corporation.

Adverse Effect on, the Condition of FloridaFirst on a consolidated  basis or the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, (b) would have
a Material Adverse Effect on the interests of SouthTrust on a consolidated basis

Material Adverse Effect on, the Condition of SouthTrust on a consolidated  basis

the Merger shall not have  occurred on or prior to July 31, 2004,  provided that
the failure to consummate the Merger on or before such date is not caused by any

contained  herein by the party  electing to  terminate  pursuant to this Section
10.1(b),  and,  provided  further that such date shall be extended to October 1,

(provided that the terminating party is not then in breach of any representation

of the other party  contained in this Agreement  which cannot be or has not been
cured  within  thirty  (30) days  after  the  giving  of  written  notice to the
breaching  party of such  inaccuracy  and which  inaccuracy  would  provide  the
terminating  party the  ability to refuse to  consummate  the  Merger  under the
applicable  standard  set forth in Section 8.1 of this  Agreement in the case of
FloridaFirst and Section 9.1 of this Agreement in the case of SouthTrust; or

within  thirty  (30) days after the giving of  written  notice to the  breaching
party of such breach; or

         (e) by the Board of Directors of SouthTrust,  ST-Sub or FloridaFirst in
the event (i) any Consent of any Regulatory  Authority required for consummation
of the Merger and the other  transactions  contemplated  hereby  shall have been
denied by final nonappealable action of such authority or if any action taken by
such  authority  is not appealed  within the time limit for appeal,  or (ii) the
shareholders of  FloridaFirst  fail to vote their approval of this Agreement and

         Section 10.2 Effect of Termination; Termination Fee.
                      --------------------------------------

         (a) In the  event of the  termination  of this  Agreement  pursuant  to
Section  10.1 of this  Agreement,  the  Agreement  shall  terminate  and have no
effect,  except as otherwise  provided  herein and except that the provisions of
this Section 10.2,  Section 10.5 and Article 11 of this Agreement  shall survive
any such termination and abandonment.

         (b)  If,  after  the  date  of  this  Agreement,   (i)  an  Acquisition
Transaction (as defined below) is offered, presented or proposed to FloridaFirst
or  its  shareholders,  (ii)  thereafter  this  Agreement  and  the  Merger  are
disapproved by  FloridaFirst or by the  shareholders  of FloridaFirst  and (iii)
within one year after  termination  of this Agreement as a result of disapproval
by  FloridaFirst  or  by  the  shareholders  of  FloridaFirst,   an  Acquisition
Transaction  is  consummated  or a  definitive  agreement  is  entered  into  by
FloridaFirst  relating to an Acquisition  Transaction (a "Trigger Event"),  then
immediately  upon the  occurrence  of a  Trigger  Event and in lieu of any other
rights and  remedies of  SouthTrust,  FloridaFirst  shall pay  SouthTrust a cash
amount of $5,100,000 as an agreed-upon  termination fee (the "Termination Fee").
For purposes of this Section 10.2, "Acquisition Transaction" shall, with respect
to FloridaFirst,  mean any of the following:  (a) a merger or consolidation,  or
any similar  transaction  (other  than the  Merger) of any  company  with either
FloridaFirst or FF-Bank,  (b) a purchase,  lease or other  acquisition of all or
substantially all the assets of either  FloridaFirst or FF-Bank,  (c) a purchase
or other  acquisition of  "beneficial  ownership" by any "person" or "group" (as
such terms are  defined in Section  13(d)(3)  of the  Securities  Exchange  Act)
(including by way of merger, consolidation,  share exchange, or otherwise) which
would cause such person or group to become the  beneficial  owner of  securities
representing  35% or more of the voting power of either  FloridaFirst or

                                       49
<PAGE>

FF-Bank  or any  significant  subsidiary  of  FloridaFirst,  or (d) a tender  or
exchange  offer to  acquire  securities  representing  35% or more of the voting
power of FloridaFirst.

         (c)  FloridaFirst and SouthTrust agree that the Termination Fee is fair
and reasonable in the circumstances.  If a court of competent jurisdiction shall
nonetheless,  by a final,  nonappealable judgment,  determine that the amount of
any such  Termination Fee exceeds the maximum amount  permitted by law, then the
amount of such  Termination Fee shall be reduced to the maximum amount permitted
by  law  in  the  circumstances,  as  determined  by  such  court  of  competent
jurisdiction.

         Section 10.3 Amendments. To the extent permitted by law, this Agreement
                      ----------
may be amended by a subsequent writing signed by each of SouthTrust, ST-Sub, and
FloridaFirst.

         Section 10.4 Waivers.  Subject to Section 11.11 hereof,  prior to or at
                      -------

FloridaFirst,  on the other  hand,  shall have the right to waive any default in
the  performance of any term of this Agreement by the other,  to waive or extend
the time for the  compliance or  fulfillment  by the other of any and all of the
other's  obligations  under  this  Agreement  and  to  waive  any  or all of the
conditions to its obligations under this Agreement, except any condition, which,
if not  satisfied,  would result in the  violation of any law or any  applicable
governmental regulation.

         Section  10.5  Non-Survival  of  Representations  and  Warranties.  The
                        --------------------------------------------------
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in any
instrument  delivered by SouthTrust or ST-Sub, or FloridaFirst shall not survive
the Effective Time of Merger, except that Section 5.3(b),  Section 5.17, Section
6.3(b),  Section  6.3(c),  Section  6.3(d) and  Section  6.4 shall  survive  the
Effective Time of the Merger, and any  representation,  warranty or agreement in
any  agreement,  contract,  report,  opinion,  undertaking  or other document or
instrument  delivered  hereunder  in whole or in part by any  person  other than
SouthTrust,  ST-Sub,  FloridaFirst  (or directors and officers  thereof in their
capacities as such) shall survive the Effective Time of Merger; provided that no
representation  or  warranty of  SouthTrust,  ST-Sub or  FloridaFirst  contained
herein  shall be  deemed  to be  terminated  or  extinguished  so as to  deprive
SouthTrust or ST-Sub, on the one hand, and  FloridaFirst,  on the other hand, of
any defense at law or in equity  which any of them  otherwise  would have to any
claim against them by any person, including, without limitation, any shareholder
or former  shareholder of either party.  No  representation  or warranty in this
Agreement  shall be  affected  or  deemed  waived  by  reason  of the fact  that
SouthTrust,  ST-Sub or FloridaFirst  and/or its  representatives  knew or should
have known that any such  representation  or warranty was, is, might be or might
have been inaccurate in any respect.
