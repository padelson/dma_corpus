TRANSACTION AGREEMENT

TRANSACTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated as of September 28, 2017
between Invesco Ltd., a Bermuda corporation ("Buyer"), and Guggenheim Capital,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Seller").

W I T N E S S E T H :

WHEREAS, Seller and certain of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries are engaged in
the business of creating, distributing, operating, sponsoring and advising the
ETF Funds and of creating, publishing, managing and disseminating the
proprietary indexes utilized by the ETF Funds or under development (or
developed but not commercialized) as of the Closing Date (as conducted as of
the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, the "ETFs Business");

WHEREAS, certain of Seller's wholly-owned Subsidiaries are the record and
beneficial owners of 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests
(the "Membership Interests") of Accretive Asset Management, LLC, a Washington
limited liability company, and Guggenheim Specialized Products, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (together, the "Transferred Entities"),
which are engaged in the ETFs Business; and

WHEREAS, Seller desires to cause such Subsidiaries to sell, and Buyer desires
to purchase from such Subsidiaries of Seller, 100% of the outstanding
Membership Interests, together with the other assets primarily used in or
relating to the ETFs Business (which will be contributed to the Transferred
Entities pursuant to the Restructuring), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereinafter set forth;

ACCORDINGLY, in consideration of the promises and of the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

"Adjusted Assets Under Management" as of any date means the sum, for any ETF
Fund in question as of such date, of the amount, expressed in U.S. dollars, of
assets under management for each such ETF Fund as of such date valued as
follows: 

(a) for purposes of calculating the Base Revenue Run-Rate as of the Base Date,
in the same manner as provided for the calculation of base investment
management fees payable in respect of each such ETF Fund pursuant to the terms
of the Existing ETF Contracts applicable to such ETF Fund; and

(b) for purposes of calculating the Closing Revenue Run-Rate as of the Closing
Measurement Date, as of the Closing Date or as of the BulletShares ETF
Measurement Date, as applicable, as the amount calculated pursuant to
subsection (a) above, (i) increased by a positive amount equal to additions,
contributions and reinvestments actually funded to such ETF Fund (including
any ETF Fund launched after the Base Date) after the Base Date and on or prior
to the Closing Measurement Date, the Closing Date or the BulletShares ETF
Measurement Date, as applicable, (ii) decreased by terminations, withdrawals,
redemptions and repurchases actually funded out of each such ETF Fund after
the Base Date and prior to the Closing Measurement Date, the Closing Date or
the BulletShares ETF Measurement Date, as applicable, and (iii) decreased by
the amount of any Contingent Account; provided, however, in the case of both
clauses (a) and (b) hereof (other than clauses (D), (E) and (F) below, which
shall relate solely to clause (b)):

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

additions, contributions and reinvestments shall be taken into account only
when actually funded and withdrawals, redemptions and repurchases shall be
taken into account when they are actually funded out of such ETF Fund; 

|

(B)

|

any assets under management for any ETF Fund for which the ETFs Business acts

shall be counted only once; 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

any assets under management for any set of ETF Funds one of which invests in
the other shall be counted only once if the ETFs Business acts as investment
adviser to both, except to the extent that an investment management fee is
payable to the ETFs Business in respect of each such multiple ETF Funds and
including such amount is required to reflect revenues generated by the ETFs
Business and does not result in double-counting; 

| 
---|--- 

(D)

|

to the extent any addition, contribution, reinvestment, withdrawal, redemption
or repurchase after the Base Date is made in a currency other than U.S.
dollars, for purposes of clause (b) hereof, such amount shall be converted to
U.S. dollars at the currency exchange rate on the date of any such
contribution, reinvestment, withdrawal, redemption or repurchase; 

| 
---|--- 

(E)

Transferred Entity, Buyer or its applicable Subsidiary, effective not later

Seller, by notice to Buyer, which notice shall be delivered not later than two

(a) If the Closing Revenue Run-Rate is less than 0.925 multiplied by the Base
Revenue Run-Rate, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction.

(b) Any adjustment resulting from the application of this Section 2.03 is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price
Adjustment".

Section 2.04. True-Up. (a) Upon the expiration of the True-Up Period, the
parties shall recalculate the Closing Revenue-Run Rate Purchase Price
Adjustment as of the Closing Date; provided that if any ETF Fund that was a
Contingent Account on the Closing Measurement Date (i) has satisfied the
applicable Assignment Requirements or (ii) is the subject of a Fund Change
Announcement, in either case, not later than the final day of the True-Up
Period then such ETF Fund shall not be treated as a Contingent Account for
purposes of such recalculation and the Adjusted Assets Under Management as of
the Closing Date for such ETF Fund shall be fully included in Closing Revenue
Run-Rate for 

purposes of such recalculation; provided, further, that the recalculation of
the Closing Revenue-Run Rate Purchase Price Adjustment relating to each
BulletShares-branded ETF Fund shall, as long as such BulletShares-branded ETF
Fund has met the Assignment Requirements or any BulletShares-branded ETF Fund
has been the subject of a Fund Change Announcement, be calculated as of the
BulletShares ETF Measurement Date and regardless of whether such BulletShares-
branded ETF Fund was a Contingent Account on the Closing Measurement Date.

(b) If such recalculation yields:

(i) a reduced Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction, then Buyer
shall pay to Seller an amount that is equal to the amount of such reduction to
the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction as soon as is reasonably
practicable after, but in any event within ten Business Days of, the date upon
which the recalculation described in this Section 2.04(b)(i) is made; or

(ii) an increased Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price Reduction or an
amount that would give rise for the first time to a Closing Revenue Run-Rate
Purchase Price Reduction, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount that is
equal to the amount of such increase to the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase
Price Reduction or the amount of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Purchase Price
Reduction (as applicable) as soon as is reasonably practicable after, but in
any event within ten Business Days of, the date upon which the recalculation
described in this Section 2.04(b)(ii) is made.

(c) Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be payable in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of Buyer or Seller,
as the case may be, with a bank designated by such receiving party.

(d) For purposes of this Section 2.04, all references to the Closing
Measurement Date included in the definitions of Adjusted Assets Under
Management and Closing Revenue Run-Rate shall be deemed references to the
Closing Date.

Section 2.05. Purchase Price Allocation. As soon as practicable (but in any
event within 90 days) after the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
statement (the "Allocation Statement") allocating the consideration paid
pursuant to this Agreement among the assets of the Transferred Entities and
the certain other assets relating to the ETFs Business in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code, it being understood that amounts allocable to
unrealized profit from transferred customer contracts, if any, shall not
exceed an amount equal to the amount of such fees that have accrued sixty (60)
days following the Closing less allocable expenses, and any excess amounts
allocable to such transferred customer contracts shall be classified as "Class
VI" or "Class VII" assets. If, within 30 days after the delivery of the
Allocation Statement, Buyer notifies Seller 

in writing that Buyer objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation
Statement, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve such dispute within 30 days. In the event that Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve such dispute within 30 days, Buyer and Seller shall jointly
cause independent accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and Seller (who shall not have any material relationship
with Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates) (the "Accounting
Referee") promptly to resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of the
disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Allocation Statement shall be
adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. No Party shall
(or shall permit any Affiliate) to take a position on any Tax Return, before
any Tax Authority or in any Tax Proceeding that is in any manner inconsistent
with the Allocation Statement, unless specifically required pursuant to a
determination by the applicable Taxing Authority. The Parties will promptly
advise each other of the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation
related to any allocation hereunder.

all material respects as conducted, owned, leased or operated as of the date
of this Agreement; and (ii) Seller and each of the Covered Subsidiaries is
duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the character or location of the properties and assets owned,
leased or operated by it makes such qualification necessary other than any

and performance by Seller (or any such Subsidiary) of this Agreement and each
of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is or will be a party, and each of the
transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder, have been duly and validly
authorized and no additional corporate or shareholder authorization or consent

Agreements to which it (or any such Subsidiary) is or will be a party or any
of the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder.

Section 3.04. Binding Effect. Assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Buyer (or, in the
case of the Ancillary Agreements, Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer), this
Agreement constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement when executed and
delivered will constitute, a valid and legally binding obligation of Seller
(or, in the case of the Ancillary Agreements, of Seller or a Subsidiary of
Seller) enforceable against Seller or such Subsidiary in accordance with its
terms, subject (in the case of enforceability) to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity
principles.

Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) are not required to obtain any
authorization, waiver, consent or approval of, make any filing or registration

connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this
Agreement or the execution, delivery and performance by Seller or its
Subsidiaries of each of the Ancillary Agreements to which Seller or any of its

for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or for purposes of comparable state,
local or foreign Tax Law).

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETFs
Business Material Adverse Effect and (ii) prior to the date of this Agreement,
except, in the case of clause (A), for any actions taken in connection with

applicable during such period.





Section 3.19. Compliance with Laws. (a) Except with respect to Taxes (which is
specifically provided for in Section 3.12 and Article 8), in the past three
years, Seller and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) in
connection with the ETFs Business and the ETF Funds have complied with, and
are currently in compliance with, and currently operate and maintain their
businesses in compliance with, all applicable Laws, except for such failures
to comply as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect. No unresolved
inquiry or investigation by any Government Entity with respect to the Seller
and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) in connection with the
ETFs Business or the ETF Funds is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, and no Government Entity has notified Seller or its Affiliates
(including any Transferred Entity) in writing or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
orally of its intention to conduct the same, except in any such case, such
investigations as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect. None of Seller or
its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) with respect to the ETFs
Business or the ETF Funds has received any written or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, oral notice or communication (i) of any unresolved violation or
exception by any Government Entity relating to any examination of the ETFs
Business, (ii) threatening to revoke or condition the continuation of any
Permit relating to the ETFs Business or (iii) restricting or disqualifying the
ETFs Business' activities (except for restrictions generally imposed by rule,
regulation or administrative policy on similarly regulated Persons generally),
except in any such case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No Seller, Affiliate of Seller (including any Transferred Entity) or any
of their respective "affiliated persons" (as that term is defined in the
Investment Company Act as interpreted by the SEC or its equivalent under any
applicable state or foreign Law) has any express or implied understanding or
arrangement that would impose an unfair burden on any ETF Fund as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or would in any way make
unavailable to Seller the benefits of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company
Act, or any similar safe harbors provided by any applicable state or foreign
Law, with respect to such ETF Fund.

(c) In the past three years, Seller and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) have filed all regulatory reports, schedules, forms,
notices, registrations and other documents that relate to the ETFs Business,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that
they were required to file with (i) any applicable domestic or foreign Self-
Regulatory Organization and (ii) all other applicable Government Entities, and
have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith,
except in any such case, such matters that would not reasonably be expected to
have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect.

forward Contracts and other similar risk management arrangements and
derivative financial instruments in effect as of the date of this Agreement or

(including the Transferred Entities) for the account of one or more of the ETF
Funds, were entered into (i) to the extent entered into by or for the account
of such an ETF Fund, in accordance with investment guidelines, prospectuses or
offering memoranda applicable to such ETF Fund, (ii) in accordance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws and (iii) with counterparties as
directed by the applicable ETF Fund (where the ETF Fund so directs), in all
cases except where failure to do so would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Seller or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities),
any ETF Fund, nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto is in
material breach of any of its obligations under any such Contract.

(e) To the Knowledge of Seller, except as not prohibited under applicable Law,
in the past three years, no Transferred Entity, and none of Seller or any of
its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Entities) with respect to the ETFs
Business, has offered or given anything of value to any official of a
Government Entity, any political party or official thereof, or any candidate
for political office (i) with the intent of inducing such Person to use such
Person's influence with any Government Entity to affect or influence any act
or decision of such Government Entity or to assist the obtaining or retaining
of business for, or with, or the directing of business to a Transferred Entity
or the ETFs Business, or (ii) constituting a bribe, kickback or illegal or
improper payment to assist a Transferred Entity or the ETFs Business in
obtaining or retaining business for or with any Government Entity.

(iii) the stated annualized fee rate payable to the ETFs Business by such ETF

or other Persons with respect to the distribution of shares of such ETF Fund
or to services provided to the ETF Fund shareholders, in each case as of the
Base Date;

(iv) the rate and method of computation of any amounts payable in respect of
revenue sharing or licensing arrangements to any Person by Seller or its

(b) Each Existing ETF Contract and any amendment, continuance or renewal
thereof, in each case, in effect as of the date of this Agreement, (i) has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Seller or a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Seller and (ii) is a valid and legally binding agreement,
enforceable against Seller or such applicable Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge
of Seller, each other party thereto, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity
principles, except, in any such case, for such matters that would not
reasonably be expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect. Other
than reimbursement obligations pursuant to ETF Contracts as in effect on the
date hereof and included on the list referenced in Section 3.20(a), or the fee
waiver or expense reimbursement arrangements set forth on Section 3.20(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, none of Seller or its Subsidiaries has any
arrangements or agreements with any of the ETF Funds pursuant to which Seller
or any such Subsidiary has agreed to pay, reimburse or otherwise be
responsible for any material expense of or material claims against any of the
ETF Funds.

registered, in the United States as an investment adviser, commodity trading
adviser, commodity pool operator or broker-dealer under the Commodity Exchange
Act of 1936, the Exchange Act or the Investment Advisers Act or in a similar
capacity in any other jurisdiction, except, in any such case, for such matters
that would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the ETFs Business taken as a whole.

(d) None of Seller nor its Affiliates have any "seed capital" investments in
the ETF Funds.

(e) The ETFs Business currently maintains the investment management
performance composites listed in Section 3.20(e) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (the "Composites"). The performance history of the Composites is

accurate and complete in all material respects. Except as set forth on Section
3.20(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all of the investment decision
makers 

responsible for the investment performance reflected in the Composites who are
employed in the ETFs Business on the date hereof are included among the ETF
Business Employees and none of Seller nor its Affiliates will object to the
use by Buyer and its Affiliates of all Composites following the Closing.

Section 3.21. ETF Funds. (a) Organization. Each ETF Fund has been duly
organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has, and at all times in the past three
years (or, if later, since its launch date), had the requisite power, right
and authority to carry on its business as it is now (or was then) being
conducted in each jurisdiction where it is organized or listed on an exchange,
except where such lack of such power, right or authority would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an ETFs
Business Material Adverse Effect, and (except in the case of the
CurrencyShares Funds) is duly registered with the SEC as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Each ETF Fund that is required to be
registered as a regulated fund or investment company under the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States is so registered, other than any
failure to be so registered that would not reasonably be expected to have an
ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Fund Boards. Each of the 40 Act ETF Funds is governed by a board of
trustees or board of directors at least 75% of whom are not "interested
persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the investment adviser
to such ETF Fund.

(c) Compliance. (i) Each ETF Fund has complied in the past three years (or, if
later, since its launch date) and is in compliance with its investment
policies and restrictions, if any, as such policies and restrictions may be
set forth in its offering or plan documents (as they may be amended from time
to time) and in applicable Laws, if any, and (ii) the value of the Net Assets
of each ETF Fund has been determined in the past three years (or, if later,
since its launch date) and is being determined using portfolio valuation
methods that comply in all material respects with the methods described in its
offering or plan documents, if any, and the requirements of any applicable
Laws, other than, in each case of (i) and (ii), any non-compliance that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an ETFs
Business Material Adverse Effect. There is no material Legal Proceeding
pending against any ETF Fund or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened
against any ETF Fund. There is no material injunction, order, award, judgment,
settlement, decree or regulatory restriction not generally imposed on
similarly situated investment funds imposed upon or entered into by any ETF
Fund.

(d) Fund Financial Statements.

(i) Seller has made available to Buyer, or directed Buyer to, prior to the
date of this Agreement copies of the financial statements for the most
recently completed fiscal year, to the extent that they exist, of each of the
ETF Funds (the "Fund Financial Statements"). Each of the 

Fund Financial Statements fairly presents in all material respects the results
of operations and changes in Net Assets of the respective ETF Fund as of the
date thereof

(ii) (A) The annual report to shareholders of each of the ETF Funds with
respect to such ETF Fund's most recently completed fiscal year and all other
documents filed subsequent to such fiscal year end under Section 30(a) or
30(b) of the Investment Company Act (or the Exchange Act in the case of the
CurrencyShares Funds), in each case in the form filed with the SEC or
delivered to shareholders (each, an "ETF Fund Financial Report"), did not, as
of their respective dates (without giving effect to any amendment thereto
filed after the date hereof) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were or are made, not misleading, and (B) each of the financial
statements contained in or incorporated by reference into the ETF Fund
Financial Reports (including the related notes and schedules thereto) fairly
presents in all material respects the financial position of the entity or
entities to which it relates as of its date, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied, except in each case as
may be noted therein, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case
of unaudited statements, except in the cases of clauses (A) and (B) for
instances of noncompliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Principal Offering Documents for ETF Funds. To the extent a prospectus,
statement of additional information or offering memorandum ("Prospectus") is
used as of the date of this Agreement to offer shares or other interests in an
ETF Fund, a copy of such Prospectus has been made available to Buyer prior to
the date of this Agreement. Each Prospectus used as of the date of this
Agreement to offer shares or other interests in an ETF Fund has been prepared
in compliance with the requirements of applicable Laws, except for any failure
to comply that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect. In the past three
years, each ETF Fund has timely filed all material Prospectuses, financial
statements, other forms, reports, sales literature and advertising, and any
other documents required to be filed with any applicable Government Entity and
any required amendments thereto (the "Reports"), except where the failure to
timely file a Report would not reasonably be expected to have an ETFs Business
Material Adverse Effect. In the past three years, the Reports have been
prepared in compliance with the requirements of applicable Laws, except for
any failure to comply that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect.

(f) ETF Fund Shares. All issued and outstanding ETF Fund shares and all other
interests, if applicable, have been duly and validly issued, are fully paid 

and, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, nonassessable, and were not
issued in violation of preemptive or similar rights or applicable Law, except
for such matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect. In the past
three years, all outstanding ETF Fund shares and all other interests, if
applicable, that were required to be registered under the Securities Act have
been sold in all material respects pursuant to an effective registration
statement filed thereunder (and, where applicable, under the Investment
Company Act) and are qualified in all material respects for sale, or an
exemption from any requirement to so qualify is in full force and effect, in
each state and territory of the United States and the District of Columbia and
in any foreign jurisdiction to the extent required under applicable Law and no
such registration statement contained, as of its effective date, any untrue
statement of material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
is subject to any stop order or similar order restricting its use, other than,
in each case, any failure to be registered or qualified or exempt, any
inclusion of an untrue statement of a material fact or any failure to state a
material fact that is required to be stated or any order restricting its use
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect.

(g) Contracts. No ETF Fund is party to or subject to any Contract which is in
violation, breach or event of default, or event or condition that, after
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a violation, breach or event
of default thereunder, on the part of the ETF Fund, or to the Knowledge of
Seller, any other Person, except for such matters that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an ETFs Business Material
Adverse Effect. All investment advisory services rendered to the ETF Funds by
Seller and its Subsidiaries have been rendered by them pursuant to Contracts
that were approved by the boards of the ETF Funds and annually continued in
effect by such boards where such approval and annual continuances are required
under applicable Law and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the
holders of shares of beneficial interest or of common stock in each ETF Fund,
except for such matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect.

(h) Policies and Procedures. Each 40 Act ETF Fund has written policies and
procedures adopted pursuant to Rule 38a-1 of the Investment Company Act that
are reasonably designed to prevent, detect and correct material violations of
the Federal Securities Laws, as such term is defined in Rule 38a-1(e)(1) under
the Investment Company Act. In the past three years, there have been no
Material Compliance Matters, as such term is defined in Rule 38a-1(e)(2) under
the Investment Company Act, for any 40 Act ETF Fund, other than those which
(i) have been reported to the applicable ETF Fund Board and satisfactorily
remedied or are in the process of being remedied and (ii) would not reasonably
be expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect. Each ETF Fund
that is required to be registered under any other applicable Law has, to the
extent 

required by such other applicable Law, written policies and procedures that
are reasonably designed to prevent, detect and correct material violations of
such applicable Law, and, in the past three years, no such violations have
been detected other than those that have been satisfactorily remedied or are
in the process of being remedied and would not reasonably be expected to have
an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.21(h) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all
strategies or plans currently contemplated by Seller or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the ETF Funds to effect any merger or closure (or, in respect of
the ETF Funds branded "Guggenheim", "CurrencyShares" or "BulletShares" or any
derivative thereof, re-branding of the ETF Fund name) of, or any replacement
of the portfolio management team for, any ETF Fund, other than as contemplated
by Section 7.05.

(i) Proxy Solicitation Materials. Except to the extent it relates to Buyer,
its Affiliates or the Buyer Fund or Buyer Fund Series or includes information
provided by Buyer, its Affiliates or the Buyer Fund or Buyer Fund Series
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein (to which
extent no representation by Seller is made) and except in the case of a Fund
Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the proxy solicitation, or other consent
solicitation, materials prepared by Seller or its Subsidiaries and distributed
to the investors in a ETF Fund in connection with the Assignment Requirements
will not, at the time of the mailing of such proxy, or other consent,
materials or any amendments or supplements thereto, or at the time of the
shareholders or investors meeting held in relation thereto, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and will contain all
information necessary in order to make the disclosure of information therein
satisfy the requirements of applicable Laws in all material respects. None of
the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Seller, its
Affiliates or the 40 Act ETF Funds specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in a Fund Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the time of
the mailing of such document or any amendments or supplements thereto, or at
the time of the shareholders or investors meeting held in relation thereto,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(j) Existing ETF Contracts. Each Existing ETF Contract subject to Section 15
of the Investment Company Act has been duly approved, continued and at all
times in the past three years has been in compliance with the Investment
Company Act, except for such matters that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an ETFs Business Material Adverse
Effect. Each Existing ETF Contract, whether or not subject to Section 15 of
the Investment Company Act, has been performed by the ETFs Business in the
past three years in accordance with its terms, except for such matters that
would not, 

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an ETFs
Business Material Adverse Effect.

(k) Certain Tax Matters of the ETF Funds. Section 3.21(k) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth with respect to each ETF Fund the intended
classification of such ETF Fund as:

(i) a regulated investment company taxable under Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of
the Code and under any similar provisions of state or local Law in any
jurisdiction in which such ETF Fund filed, or is required to file, a Tax
Return;

(ii) a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and any similar
provisions of state or local law in any jurisdiction in which such ETF Fund
filed or was required to file, a Tax Return;

(iii) a grantor trust taxable under Subchapter J of Chapter 1 of the Code and
under any similar provisions of state or local Law in any jurisdiction in
which such ETF Fund filed, or is required to file, a Tax Return; or

(iv) an entity organized under the laws of a foreign country that qualifies
for the special Tax treatment under the laws of such foreign country specified
on Section 3.21(k) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; and, to the Knowledge of
Seller, each such ETF Fund has qualified, for all taxable years since its
inception, to be so classified. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have an ETFs Business Material Adverse Effect, each ETF Fund (i) has duly and
timely filed with the appropriate Government Entity all material Tax Returns
required to be filed and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all material respects, (ii) has timely paid, or withheld and paid over, all
Taxes due or claimed to be due by any Government Entity or with respect to
Taxes not yet due and payable, made an adequate provision on its financial

filing, solicitation, collection and maintenance of any forms, certifications
and other information required in connection with federal, state, local or
foreign Tax reporting requirements, (iv) that is intended to be a tax-exempt

Code, and is qualified to pay exempt interest dividends as defined therein,
and (v) with variable insurance trust portfolios has complied with the

(as defined in Section VI(d) of Department of Labor Class Exemption 84-14
("PTE 84-14")) who is also a director, officer or employee of a Transferred
Entity, and who is also a Transferred Employee, has been convicted of or
released from imprisonment with respect to any felony or other crime that
would prevent the Buyer from qualifying as a qualified professional asset
manager as defined in PTE 84-14 after the Closing.

or any interests therein.

Section 3.23. [Intentionally Omitted]

listed in Section 3.24 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and except for the
fact that the Buyer will not (1) acquire Seller's registered investment
adviser, distribution and broker-dealer Subsidiaries engaged in the ETFs
Business, (2) acquire any employees engaged in the ETFs Business other than
the Identified Business Employees, or (3) be assigned, transferred or conveyed
the right, title and interest of Seller and its Affiliates in any Specified

information and materials to be provided to Buyer under Section 5.02(c) and
(z) the administrative services to be provided under the Transition Services
Agreement, are in all material respects sufficient (i) for the conduct of the
ETFs Business immediately following the Closing in substantially the same
manner as conducted on the date hereof or as of the Closing Date and (ii) to
provide the services relating to the use and maintenance of indexes that are
utilized by the ETF Funds on the date hereof as such services are provided by
Seller and its controlled Subsidiaries on the date hereof or as of the Closing
Date in connection with the ETFs Business in all material respects, and (b)
there are no material assets, properties or rights primarily used in the
conduct of the ETFs Business as presently conducted which will not following
the Restructuring be (i) owned, leased or licensed by the Transferred
Entities, (ii) covered by the Index Data Agreement, the Assigned Contracts,
the Transferred Entity Records, the Other ETFs Business Records or the other
information and materials to be provided to Buyer under Section 5.02(c) or
(iii) administrative services to be provided under the Transition Services

Section 3.25. Finders' Fees. Except for fees that will be paid by Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities), there is no investment
banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities and their Subsidiaries) who would be entitled to any fee
or commission from any Person (other than Seller or one of its Affiliates
other than a Transferred Entity) in connection with this Agreement, any of the
Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereunder and
thereunder.

Section 3.26. Insurance. The Transferred Entities will be covered, prior to
Closing, by insurance policies of Seller, and the Transferred Entities do not

are terminable by either party thereby without penalty upon notice of 60 days
or less and set forth in Section 3.27 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there
is no Contract, liability or obligation (whether or not evidenced by a
writing) between a Transferred Entity, on the one hand, and Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities), on the other hand (any
such Contract, liability or obligation, an "Affiliate Arrangement").

Section 3.28. Filings. None of the information regarding Seller, any of its
Affiliates or any ETF Fund supplied or to be supplied by Seller, any of its
Affiliates or any ETF Fund in writing specifically for inclusion in any
application, filing or other document to be filed by Buyer, its Subsidiaries

contemplated by this Agreement will, at the respective times such documents
are filed with any such Government Entity, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Section 3.29. No Other Representations. Seller acknowledges and agrees that,
except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 4, none of
Buyer or the Buyer Funds or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either
express or implied, concerning Buyer or the Buyer Funds or any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.









ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

Subject to Section 13.11, except as set forth in the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, Buyer represents and warrants to Seller as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date as follows:

Section 4.01. Organization and Qualification. Buyer is duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation.
Buyer has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business
as conducted as of the date of this Agreement and to own, lease and operate
all of its properties and assets, in all material respects as conducted,
owned, leased or operated as of the date of this Agreement. Buyer is duly
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the character or location of the properties and assets owned,
leased or operated by it makes such qualification necessary other than any
failure to be so qualified that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.02. Corporate Authorization. Buyer has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is or will be a party and to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereunder and thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is or will be a party,
and each of the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder, have been
duly and validly authorized, and no additional corporate or shareholder
authorization or consent is required in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder.

Section 4.03. Consents and Approvals. Other than in connection with (i) the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, (ii) any applicable banking, securities

compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and any other applicable state or federal securities laws or (iv)
such other Laws, in each case of (i) through (iii), that are set forth on
Section 4.03 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule (the matters covered under
clauses (i) through (iv) above, collectively, the "Buyer Required Approvals"),
Buyer and its Affiliates are not required to obtain any authorization, waiver,
consent or approval of, make any filing or registration with, or give any

the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement or the
execution, delivery and performance by Buyer and its Subsidiaries of each of
the Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is or will
be a party or the consummation by Buyer or its Subsidiaries of any of the
transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder, other than any 

authorization, waiver, consent, approval, filing, registration notice or
Permit, the failure of which to obtain, make or give would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date hereof, Buyer is not aware of any reason why any Buyer
Required Approvals will not be received in order to permit the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.04. Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and by Buyer and its Subsidiaries of each of the
Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is or will be a
party, and the consummation by Buyer and its Subsidiaries of the transactions
contemplated hereunder and thereunder, do not and will not (i) conflict with
or violate any provision of the Organizational Documents of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming the receipt of all consents, approvals,
waivers and authorizations and the making of the notices and filings referred
to in Section 4.03, conflict with, or result in the breach of, or constitute a
default under, or result in the termination, Encumbrance, cancellation,
modification or acceleration of any right or obligation of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries under, or give rise to any payment conditioned, in whole or in
part, on approval or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
result in a loss of any benefit to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled, with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both,
under any Contract or other agreement or instrument binding upon Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries or to which the property of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject or (iii) assuming the receipt of all consents,
approvals, waivers and authorizations and the making of notices and filings
(A) referred to in Section 4.03 or (B) required to be received or made by any
of the Transferred Entities or by Seller of any of its Affiliates, violate or
result in a breach of or constitute a default under any Law to which Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries is subject or under any Permit of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any conflict,
breach, default, termination, Encumbrance, cancellation, modification,
acceleration or loss that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect (excluding, for
this purpose only, clause (H) of the definition of Material Adverse Effect).

Section 4.05. Binding Effect. Assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Seller (or, in the
case of the Ancillary Agreements, Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller), this
Agreement constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement when executed and
delivered will constitute, a valid and legally binding obligation of Buyer
(or, in the case of the Ancillary Agreements, of Buyer or a Subsidiary of
Buyer) enforceable against Buyer or such Subsidiary in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles. 

Section 4.06. Financial Capability. Buyer has, or will have at the Closing,
funds sufficient to pay the amounts required to be paid under Article 2 and to
pay all related fees and expenses hereunder.

Section 4.07. Investment Purpose. Buyer is acquiring the Membership Interests
for its own account solely for the purpose of investment and not with a view
to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of
the Securities Act or state securities or "blue sky" Law, or with any present
intention of distributing or selling such interests in violation of any such
Law. Buyer has requested, received, reviewed and considered all information
that Buyer deems relevant in making an informed decision to acquire the
Membership Interests, and has had an opportunity to discuss the business,
management and financial affairs of the Transferred Entities with management
of the ETFs Business and also had an opportunity to ask questions of officers
of Seller or its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) that were
answered to Buyer's satisfaction; provided that such inquires do not impair
the rights of Buyer to rely on the representations and warranties of Seller as
set forth in Article 3. Buyer understands that Seller is relying on the
statements contained herein to establish an exemption from registration under
U.S. federal and state securities Laws. Buyer acknowledges that the Membership
Interests are not registered under the Securities Act and that the Membership
Interests may not be transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of except
pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act or pursuant to
an applicable exemption therefrom and pursuant to Laws and regulations of
other jurisdictions as applicable.

Section 4.08. Information in Proxy and Consent Solicitation Materials. None of
the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Buyer, its
Affiliates or the Buyer Fund or the Buyer Series specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the proxy solicitation, or other consent
solicitation, materials distributed to the investors in an ETF Fund in
connection with the Assignment Requirements will, at the time of the mailing
of such proxy, or other consent, materials or any amendments or supplements
thereto, or at the time of the shareholders or investors meeting held in
relation thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Except to the extent it relates to Seller, its Affiliates or
the 40 Act ETF Funds or with respect to information provided by Seller, its
Affiliates or the 40 Act ETF Funds specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein (to which extent no representation by Buyer is made),
each Fund Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus will not, at the time of the
mailing of such document or any amendments or supplements thereto, or at the
time of the shareholders or investors meeting held in relation thereto,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and will
contain all information necessary in order to make the disclosure of
information therein satisfy the requirements of applicable Laws in all
material respects. 

Section 4.09. Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act. None of Buyer or
any of its respective "interested persons" (as that term is defined under
applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the
SEC) has any express or implied understanding or arrangement which would
impose an "unfair burden" (as such term is used in Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act) on any 40 Act ETF Fund or any Buyer Fund for purposes
of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby or which would in any way cause Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act to be unavailable to Seller.

Section 4.10. Filings. None of the information regarding Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or Buyer Fund or any Buyer Fund Series supplied or to be supplied
by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or Buyer Fund or any Buyer Fund Series in
writing for inclusion in any application, filing or other document to be filed
with any Government Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will, at the respective times such documents are filed with any
such Government Entity, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

Section 4.11. Compliance with Laws. In the past three years, Buyer, its
Subsidiaries and Buyer Fund and the Buyer Fund Series have complied with, are
currently in compliance with, and currently operate and maintain their
businesses in compliance with, all applicable Laws, except for such failures
to comply as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. No unresolved investigation
by any Government Entity with respect to any of Buyer, its Subsidiaries, the
Buyer Fund or the Buyer Fund Series is pending or, to the Knowledge of Buyer,
threatened, and no Government Entity has notified Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries in writing or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, orally of its intention
to conduct the same, except, in any such case, such investigations as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. None of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or the Buyer Fund
or the Buyer Fund Series has received any written or, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, oral notice or communication (i) of any unresolved violation or
exception by any Government Entity, (ii) threatening to revoke or condition
the continuation of any Permit or (iii) restricting or disqualifying their
activities (except for restrictions generally imposed by rule, regulation or
administrative policy on similarly regulated Persons generally), except in any
such case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.12. Finders' Fees. Except for fees that will be paid by Buyer, there
is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been
retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates who might be entitled to any fee or commission from Buyer or any of
its Affiliates in 

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.

Section 4.13. Legal Proceedings. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
Legal Proceeding pending against, or to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened
against, or affecting Buyer or any of its Affiliates that challenges the
validity or enforceability of this Agreement or seeks to enjoin or prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There is no
Legal Proceeding pending against, or to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened
against, or affecting Buyer or any of its Affiliates, except for any such
Legal Proceeding that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.14. No Other Representations. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that,
except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 3, none of
Seller or the ETF Funds or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either
express or implied, concerning Seller or the ETF Funds or any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 5.02(a) shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder.

independent search firm that contacts ETFs Business Employees without

to be direct or indirect solicitations. The foregoing prohibition shall not
apply to any employee whose employment has been terminated by Buyer or its
applicable Affiliate after the Closing.

(b) As an inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to more
effectively protect the value and goodwill of the ETFs Business, Seller

contained in this Section 5.05 shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section 5.05,
but this 

Section 5.05 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties
that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to be
for a length of time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way
construed to be to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed
to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction
shall construe and interpret or reform this Section 5.05 to provide for a
covenant having the maximum enforceable time period and other provisions (not
greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under
such applicable Law. Seller acknowledges that Buyer would be irreparably
harmed by any breach of this Section 5.05 and that there would be no adequate

each of its Affiliates (including each Transferred Entity) to, (i) cease any
and all use of Seller's or its Affiliates' marks or names set forth on Section
6.02 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Seller Marks"),
(ii) remove, conceal, cover, redact and/or replace such Seller Marks from any
and all materials and assets under the control or possession of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates that contain the Seller Marks, and (iii) cause its name to
be changed to such other name that does not include the Seller Marks and make
all necessary filings and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
applicable Governmental Authorities to change all applications, registrations
and filings, including corporate names, seals and certificates of Buyer and
its Affiliates such that they will not include any Seller Marks; provided that
Buyer and its Affiliates may use the Seller Marks following the Trademark
Transition Period solely to refer to the ETFs Business in a historical manner
as required by Law or as required for the continued use following the Closing
of the performance track records of the ETF Funds, including the Composites,
in accordance with GIPS (or any successor standards to GIPS) and Law. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent it or any of its Affiliates
(including each Transferred Entity) continue to use any Seller Marks in
connection with the conduct of the ETFs Business during the Trademark
Transition Period or thereafter, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, include an express disclaimer in any and all applicable written materials
or documents that the ETF Funds and the ETFs Business are no longer associated
with Seller or any of its Affiliates. From and after the Closing, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall challenge the ownership, validity or
enforceability of any Seller Marks.



ARTICLE 7 
COVENANTS OF BUYER AND SELLER

Buyer and Seller agree that:

Section 7.01. Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances. (a) Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under
applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Seller and Buyer agree to execute and deliver such other documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as
may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement
expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such actions
shall include (i) preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable
all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports, and other filings
and to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, waivers, orders, exemptions, Permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party or
Government Entity in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) taking all actions reasonably necessary in order to comply
with or satisfy the requirements of any applicable Law or other requirements
of any Government Entity that would prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer and
Seller shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable.

(c) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings. Seller and Buyer shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and
regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Seller nor Buyer may participate or
agree to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion
with any Government Entity in connection with the filings required under the
HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
unless it consults with the other party in advance (to the extent not
prohibited by such Government Entity) and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Government Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend such
meeting, telephone call or discussion. The parties hereto will consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, 

opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and Buyer may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this Section 7.01(c) as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Buyer or Seller, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

Section 7.02. Certain Filings. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one
another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Government Entity is required, or any actions, consents, approvals
or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material Contracts,
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to
obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

Section 7.03. Public Announcements. The parties agree to consult with each
other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except
for any press releases and public announcements the making of which may be
required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation. As of the date hereof, the
parties shall have mutually agreed (each acting reasonably) on the form of any
press release by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
announcing (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and (ii) the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 7.04. Intercompany Accounts and Agreements. All intercompany accounts
between the Seller or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Transferred
Entities (taking into account the Restructuring) or the ETF Funds, on the
other hand, existing prior to the Closing shall be settled (irrespective of
the terms of payment of such intercompany accounts) in the manner provided in
this Section 7.04. At least two Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement setting out in reasonable
detail the calculation of all such intercompany account balances based upon
the latest available financial information as of such date and, to the extent
requested by Buyer, provide Buyer with supporting documentation to verify the
underlying intercompany charges and transactions. All such intercompany
account balances, and any balances arising after such calculation but on or
before the Closing, shall be paid in full prior to the Closing. Except (i) to
the extent necessary for the provision of any services as contemplated in any
Ancillary Agreement, (ii) as set forth on Section 7.04 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or (iii) as otherwise mutually agreed in writing by Seller
and Buyer, all Contracts between Seller or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, 

and the ETFs Business or the ETF Funds, on the other hand, are hereby
terminated effective immediately prior to the Closing and without further
liability or obligation (contingent or otherwise) thereunder.

Section 7.05. ETF Fund Consents.

(a) Generally.

(i) Subject to the specific requirements of Section 7.05(b) through Section
7.05(d), Seller agrees to use, and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to use,
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consents and approvals necessary to
satisfy prior to the Closing Date the Assignment Requirements with respect to
each Existing ETF Contract (other than the Maturing ETFs). Buyer agrees to use
and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Seller and its Subsidiaries in their efforts so to satisfy the
Assignment Requirements with respect to each Existing ETF Contract (and to
obtain the "interim" new advisory contracts described in Section
7.05(b)(i)(B)). In the event that any such Assignment Requirements are not
satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date, following the Closing Date, Buyer
and Seller shall use (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use)
their respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy such Assignment
Requirements as soon as practicable and in any event within 180 days after the
Closing Date. For any Contingent Account that exists at the Closing
Measurement Date, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
Contingent Account not to terminate the applicable Existing ETF Contract prior
to the end of the True-Up Period. For each ETF Fund, Buyer shall, on a timely
basis, use its commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
respective Buyer Fund Series (if any) and the requisite investment advisers
and other service providers thereto are in each case properly organized and
have the requisite regulatory approvals and registrations to enable the Fund
Mergers and CurrencyShares Sponsor Continuations to occur by Closing.

(ii) Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to provide promptly in writing all
information concerning itself and its Affiliates required to be included in
the proxy solicitation, or other consent solicitation, materials or government
filings contemplated by this Section 7.05 (including the information required
for the Fund Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectuses under the Exchange Act or the
Investment Company Act or under other applicable Laws). Each of Buyer and
Seller agrees promptly to correct such information if and to the extent that
such information becomes false or misleading in any material respect.

(iii) From and after the date hereof and until the end of the True-Up Period,
Seller and Buyer shall communicate on a regular basis to stay apprised of such
efforts to satisfy the Assignment Requirements and, upon Buyer's reasonable
request, Seller shall make available to Buyer 

copies of all executed client consents and other documents evidencing
satisfaction of applicable Assignment Requirements.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of Seller, Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates shall have any obligation under this
Agreement to pay any money or other consideration beyond a de minimis review
charge to any Person that is a party to an Existing ETF Contract or to
initiate any claim or proceeding against any such Person in order to obtain
any consent, approval or New ETF Contract necessary to satisfy any Assignment
Requirement (except, for the avoidance of doubt, the sharing of certain
expenses by Seller and Buyer contemplated by Section 13.03).

(b) 40 Act ETF Funds. With respect to each 40 Act ETF Fund:

(i) Seller agrees to use, and to cause each of its Affiliates to use,
reasonable best efforts to obtain (A) the required consents and approvals
(including such approvals by the ETF Fund Board and shareholders of such 40
Act ETF Fund) necessary for a Fund Merger and (B) all required approvals by
the ETF Fund Board of such 40 Act ETF Fund of an "interim" new advisory
contract between such 40 Act ETF Fund and a Subsidiary of Buyer pursuant to
Rule 15a-4 thereunder (but (1) only to the extent all required consents and
approvals for such Fund Merger are not obtained prior to Closing or (2) it is
reasonably expected that such Fund Merger will not close at the time of the
Closing), including by providing to the applicable board of directors or board
of trustees (or similar body) all information relating to such party and its
Affiliates that is necessary and/or reasonably requested by such board to
enable it to evaluate the foregoing.

(ii) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such 40 Act ETF
Fund (to the extent shareholder approval shall be required for such Fund
Merger) to call a special meeting of the shareholders of such 40 Act ETF Fund
to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement
for purposes of obtaining the requisite approval of such shareholders for such
Fund Merger, as applicable and only to the extent required. In connection
therewith, (A) with respect to each 40 Act ETF Fund, Buyer will use (or will
cause an Affiliate to use) its reasonable best efforts to cause the Buyer Fund
and the Buyer Fund Series that is the party to such 40 Act ETF Fund's proposed
Fund Merger to prepare and to file with the SEC (to the extent such filing is
required) all securities registrations statements and prospectuses and proxy
solicitation materials necessary to comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act, Section 14 of the Exchange Act
and Section 20 of the Investment Company Act, including a securities
registration statement on SEC Form N-14 (or successor form thereto) containing
a joint proxy statement and prospectus (a "Fund Merger Proxy Statement/ 

Prospectus"), (B) Seller will use (or will cause an Affiliate to use) its
reasonable best efforts to cause each such 40 Act ETF Fund (1) to mail such
proxy solicitation materials (including, as applicable, a Fund Merger Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) to the shareholders of such 40 Act ETF Fund as promptly
as practicable after review by the SEC and (2) as soon as practicable
following the mailing of such proxy solicitation materials, submit, or cause
to be submitted, to the shareholders of such 40 Act ETF Fund, for a vote at
such shareholders meeting, the proposal described in the first sentence of
this Section 7.05(b)(ii). For the avoidance of doubt, the Existing ETF
Contract of each 40 Act ETF Fund shall be assigned to Buyer or one of its
subsidiaries at Closing in the event that the Assignment Requirements with
respect to such 40 Act ETF Fund have not been satisfied as of Closing, which
purported assignment will have the effect of terminating such Existing ETF
Contracts and thereby permit the 40 Act ETF Fund board to appoint interim
adviser(s) pursuant to Rule 15a-4(b)(2) of the Investment Company Act.

(iii) Buyer and Seller agree that consent for any Existing ETF Contract with a
40 Act ETF Fund shall be deemed given for all purposes under this Agreement
only if a Fund Merger has been approved, to the extent required, by the ETF
Fund Board of such ETF Fund under Section 7.05(b)(i)(A) and by the
shareholders of the applicable ETF Fund in accordance with Section 7.05(b)(ii)
and applicable Law.

(c) CurrencyShares Funds. With respect to each CurrencyShares Fund, Seller
agrees to notify the trustee of such CurrencyShares Fund of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the intention of the parties to effect a
CurrencyShares Sponsor Continuation in respect of such CurrencyShares Fund.
Buyer and Seller agree that the Assignment Requirements with respect to each
CurrencyShares Fund shall be deemed satisfied for all purposes hereunder.

(d) In connection with the consent solicitation provided for in this Section
7.05, (i) Buyer shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on all consent materials to be used by Seller or its Affiliates prior
to distribution and (ii) Seller shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on each Fund Merger Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Seller and
its Affiliates shall promptly upon their receipt make available to Buyer
copies of any and all substantive correspondence between it and the ETF Funds,
their boards of trustees or investors, or representatives or counsel thereof
relating to the consent solicitation provided for in this Section 7.05.

(e) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, with respect to
any 40 Act ETF Fund for which it is contemplated under this Agreement that the
Assignment Requirement is to be satisfied by a Fund Merger involving such 40
Act ETF Fund, in the event (i) that such 40 Act ETF Fund's ETF Fund Board
provides the approvals required of it to proceed with the Fund Merger but the
Buyer Fund's board of trustees fails to provide the approvals 

required of it to proceed with the Fund Merger in a timely manner or (ii) the
Buyer Fund or the 40 Act ETF Fund requires unreasonable material changes to
the Form of Fund Reorganization Agreement not acceptable to such 40 Act ETF
Fund or Buyer Fund, as the case may be, or the Buyer Fund or the 40 Act ETF
Fund, as the case may be, refuses to accept reasonable changes thereto
proposed by such 40 Act ETF Fund or Buyer Fund, then in either case the
parties agree that, with respect to such 40 Act ETF Fund, the transactions
contemplated hereby will be executed (and the Assignment Requirement will be
satisfied) without a Fund Merger by obtaining 40 Act ETF Fund board and
shareholder approval under applicable Law as necessary to permit such 40 Act
ETF Fund's Existing ETF Contract to be replaced with a New ETF Contract with a
Subsidiary of Buyer.

Section 7.06. Section 15(f). (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are intended to qualify for the
treatment described in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act. In this
regard, Buyer shall, and from and after the Closing Date shall, to the extent
within its control, cause the ETFs Business to comply with the conditions of
Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act in respect of each 40 Act ETF
Fund, including (i) by ensuring that for a period of three years after the
Closing Date, at least 75% of the board of trustees or board of directors (if
any), as the case may be, of such ETF Fund or any successor thereto (including
by reorganization or otherwise) are not "interested persons" (as that term is
defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and
interpreted by the SEC) of (A) any investment adviser of such ETF Fund after
the Closing or (B) the investment adviser of such ETF Fund prior to the
Closing; and (ii) by not imposing or seeking to impose for a period of two
years after the Closing Date, any "unfair burden" (as that term is defined in
Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) on
such ETF Fund.

(b) In complying with Section 7.06(a)(i), Buyer shall, and from and after the
Closing Date shall, to the extent within its control, cause the ETFs Business
to (i) cause any employee, officer, director or agent of Buyer, any Subsidiary
of Buyer or any of their respective "affiliated persons" (as that term is
defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and
interpreted by the SEC) who shall be a trustee or director of any 40 Act ETF
Fund, any Buyer Fund or any successor thereto (including by reorganization or
otherwise) to resign when required to maintain the percentage referred to in
Section 7.06(a)(i) and (ii) ensure that vacancies on the board of trustees or
board of directors, as the case may be, of any such 40 Act ETF Fund, Buyer
Fund or successor thereto (including by reorganization or otherwise) will be
filled by a Person who is not an "interested person" (as that term is defined
under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by
the SEC) of such an investment adviser referred to in Section 7.06(a)(i)(A) or
(B), who has been selected and proposed for election by a majority of the
trustees or directors who are not such interested persons, and who has been
elected by shareholders in accordance with Section 16(b) of the Investment
Company Act. 

(c) For a period of three years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not
engage, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates not to
engage, in any transaction that would constitute an "assignment" (as that term
is defined under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and
interpreted by the SEC) to a third party of any investment advisory contract
between Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any 40 Act ETF
Fund or Buyer Fund, on the other hand, without first obtaining from the
counterparty to such transaction a covenant in all material respects
comparable to that contained in this Section 7.06.

(d) None of Buyer or any of its affiliated persons (as that term is defined
under applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by
the SEC) has, and Buyer shall ensure that no such persons have, any express or
implied understanding or arrangement which would reasonably be expected to
impose an "unfair burden" (as that term is defined in Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) on any ETF Fund or any
Buyer Fund as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or which would
in any way violate, or otherwise make unavailable to Seller, Section 15(f) of
the Investment Company Act.

Section 7.07. Certain Post-Closing Filings. Following the Closing Date, Buyer
agrees to, or to cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, make all necessary
filings relating to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that may be required to be made with any applicable Government
Entity.

Section 7.08. Notices of Certain Events. Each party shall promptly notify the
other party of:

(a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(b) any notice or other communication from any Government Entity received by
such party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) any Legal Proceedings commenced relating to such party or its Affiliates
that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.07 or Section 4.13 as applicable;

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be expected
to cause the conditions set forth in Section 10.02(b) or Section 10.03(b) not
to be satisfied; and

(e) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.08 shall
not limit or 

otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.

Section 7.09. WARN Act. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to
determine whether any notification may be required under the U.S. Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any other worker notification
Laws applicable to any ETFs Business Employee arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall assume all
obligations and liabilities for the provision of notice or payment in lieu of
notice or any applicable penalties with respect to the Transferred Employees
under such worker notification laws arising as a result of actions taken by
Buyer on or after the Closing Date. Seller shall retain or assume all
obligations and liabilities for the provision of notice or payment in lieu of
notice or any applicable penalties with respect to the ETFs Business Employees
under such worker notification laws arising as a result of actions taken by
Seller or its Affiliates on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller (or its
applicable Affiliate) shall promptly provide Buyer with such information as is
reasonably requested by Buyer in order to determine whether any actions taken
by Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date will, if aggregated with
actions that may be taken by Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing Date,
require the provision of notice or payment in lieu of notice to the
Transferred Employees.

Section 7.10. Confidentiality.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and after any termination of this Agreement, (i)
Buyer and its Affiliates will hold in confidence, pursuant and subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (which the parties agree shall remain
in full force and effect until one year after the date of termination of this
Agreement), all documents and information concerning the ETFs Business
(including documents and information relating to clients, prospective clients,
distributors and strategic business partners) furnished to, or prepared by,
Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents and other
representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) Seller and its Affiliates will
hold in confidence, pursuant and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, all documents and information concerning Buyer and its Affiliates
(including documents and information relating to clients, prospective clients,
distributors and strategic business partners) furnished to, or prepared by,
Seller, its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents and other
representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its and their officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents and
advisors to use all reasonable efforts to, keep confidential (other than as
may be necessary to enforce its rights hereunder) and not use (other than as
may be necessary to 

enforce its rights hereunder or as contemplated by Section 2.02(b)(3)) any and
all non-public information (i) relating to Buyer and its Affiliates that
becomes known to Seller or its Affiliates or its or their officers, directors,
employees, consultants, agents or advisors in connection with or as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements or (ii) to the extent relating to the ETF Business, including its
business and financial condition, that is not generally known to the general
public; provided that, subject to the compliance by Seller and its Affiliates
with the other provisions of this Agreement, this Section 7.10(b) shall not
prohibit the use by Seller and its Affiliates after the Closing of information
relating to the ETFs Business that as of the Closing Date was, in addition to
being used in connection with the ETFs Business also used by Seller and its
Affiliates in connection with businesses other than the ETFs Business.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.10(b) if any of
Seller and its Affiliates is requested or required by oral questions,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, civil
investigative demand or similar process to disclose any such confidential
information of Buyer and its Affiliates, or any of Seller and its Affiliates
determines, based on the advice of counsel, that any such disclosure is
required under applicable Law or applicable rules or regulations of any
national securities exchange, Seller or its applicable Affiliate will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, provide Buyer with prior written notice
thereof promptly (and in any event within two business days) after receipt or
such request or determination so that Buyer may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy and/or waive Seller's compliance with the provisions
of Section 7.10(b); provided that no such notice shall be required to be given
in the case of routine examinations by any regulator that are not specifically
directed at such confidential information. Seller agrees that it will, at
Buyer's request and sole expense, exercise reasonable efforts to assist Buyer
in obtaining such protective order or other appropriate relief. If such
protective order or other remedy is denied, and Seller or any of its
Affiliates are nonetheless legally compelled to disclose such information,
Seller or its Affiliate, as the case may be, will furnish only that portion of
the confidential information that is legally required, based on advice of
Seller's counsel, and will exercise its reasonable efforts at Buyer's sole
expense to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be
accorded the confidential information. Non-public information for purposes of
Section 7.10(b) shall not include any information that (A) was publicly
available prior to the date hereof or hereafter becomes publicly available
without any violation of this Agreement on the part of Seller or its
Affiliates; (B) in the case of information of the sort specified in Section
7.10(b)(i), was available to Seller or its Affiliates on a non-confidential
basis prior to its disclosure by Buyer; provided that the source of such
information was not, to the knowledge of Seller and its Affiliates, subject to
any legally binding obligation to the Buyer to keep such information
confidential; (C) becomes available after the Closing to Seller or its
Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a person other than the Buyer who
is not, to the Knowledge of Seller and its Affiliates, subject to any legally
binding obligation to the Buyer to keep such information confidential, and 

other than from any such non-public information previously in the possession
of Seller or its Affiliates or retained by Seller or its Affiliates pursuant
hereto or (D) was or is independently developed by Seller or its Affiliates
without reference to such non-public information

Section 7.11. Restructuring. At or prior to the Closing Seller shall, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, cause the assets
primarily used in or relating to the ETFs Business to be contributed to the
Transferred Entities (or otherwise transferred to Buyer or its Subsidiaries)
pursuant to the Restructuring. In connection with the foregoing, Seller shall
(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, waivers or
approvals of any third parties that are necessary or appropriate to assign the
Assigned Contracts to the Transferred Entities (or otherwise to Buyer or its
Subsidiaries) at or prior to the Closing and (ii) enter into the Index Data
Agreement at Closing and deliver the Transferred Entity Records, Other ETFs
Business Records and other information and materials to be provided to Buyer
under Section 5.02(c). Seller shall not transfer to either Transferred Entity
or Buyer any liabilities or obligations (whether known, absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), other than
executory obligations under the Assigned Contracts that are validly assigned
to the Transferred Entities (or otherwise to Buyer or its Subsidiaries) and
with respect to which the applicable Seller affiliated entity is in compliance
with the terms thereof. The foregoing shall be effected pursuant to customary
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. At Seller's request, Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate in connection with Seller obtaining such consents,
waivers or approvals; provided, however, that such cooperation shall not
include any obligation of Buyer to expend money or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with obtaining such
consents, waivers or approvals. In the event that the parties are not able to
secure any third-party consent required for the transfer of an Assigned
Contract, the parties will cooperate to enter into a mutually agreeable
arrangement, if commercially practical, under which Buyer would obtain the
benefits and assume the obligations under such Assigned Contract(s).

Section 7.12. Pro-Ration. It is the intention of the parties that Seller will
operate the ETFs Business for its own account until the Closing, and that
Buyer shall operate the ETFs Business for its own account after the Closing
Date. Thus, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement,
certain items of income and expense that relate to the ETFs Business shall be
prorated as provided in this Section 7.12 and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 7.12 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Those
items being prorated will be handled at the Closing as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, or if not able to be calculated, as promptly as practicable
thereafter, unless otherwise agreed by the parties hereto. For purposes of
this Agreement, items of proration and other adjustments to be prorated shall
consist of: (i) wages, salaries and employee compensation, benefits and
expenses, including with respect to any deferred compensation (provided that
accruals in respect of Bonus Amounts shall be adjusted only through the
provisions contained herein relating to the defined term 

"Bonus Accrual," and in the event of any conflict between this Section 7.12
and Article IX, Article IX shall control); (ii) prepaid expenses and expenses
that have been incurred but have not been paid, in each case relating to
Assigned Contracts validly assigned to one of the Transferred Entities (or
otherwise to Buyer or its Subsidiaries) or Contracts otherwise with the
Transferred Entities; and (iii) advisory, sub-advisory, administrative and
other management fees payable after giving effect to and taking into account
any fee or expense waiver, rebate or cap, reimbursement obligation or similar
offset, any amounts payable to a sub-adviser that is not a part of the ETFs
Business (including any such amount deducted directly by or on behalf of an
ETF Fund from the fee otherwise payable by such ETF Fund to the ETFs Business
under the applicable Existing ETF Contract), and any amounts payable in
respect of revenue sharing and licensing arrangements (other than license fees
to the extent actually born by the applicable ETF Fund) relating to the ETF
Funds.

ARTICLE 8 
TAX MATTERS

Section 8.01. Allocation of Taxes. Except as provided in Section 8.03 with
respect to Apportioned Obligations, (i) Seller is responsible for and will
timely pay any (A) Taxes of the Transferred Entities or arising or resulting
from the conduct of and the operation of the ETFs Business, attributable, in
each case, to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (B) Taxes of any other Person for
which any Transferred Entity is liable under Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of U.S. state or local or foreign Law) or as transferee
or successor, (C) Taxes or Damages arising out of or relating to any breach of
any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.12(f), (D) Taxes arising
out of or relating to any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller

reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any item described in
clauses (A) through (D); and (ii) Buyer is responsible for and will timely pay
any Taxes of the Transferred Entities or arising or resulting from the conduct
of and the operation of the ETFs Business, attributable, in each case, to any

practice and file all Tax Returns required to be filed for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period with respect to the Transferred Entities and the ETFs Business,

With respect to each such Tax Return filed for the Transferred Entities,
Seller will provide Buyer with a copy of each such Tax Return for review and
comment (such comments not to be unreasonably rejected), no later than twenty
(20) days prior to the due date thereof. Seller will properly prepare and file
such Tax Returns no later than the due dates thereof, as such dates may be
extended, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Seller will pay all Taxes
and other payments required to be paid for periods covered by such Tax Returns
at the time such Tax Returns are filed. Buyer will prepare and file all Tax
Returns required to be filed for any Post- 

Closing Tax Period and any Straddle Period (or portion thereof) for which
Seller is not required to file a Tax Return pursuant to this Section 8.02 with
respect to the Transferred Entities and the ETFs Business. In the event that
Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, is liable pursuant to

a request for such reimbursement and documentation reasonably evidencing such
payment obligation.

property taxes and similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the
Transferred Entities or the ETFs Business for a taxable period which includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (collectively, the "Apportioned
Obligations") shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer based on the
number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the Post-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall be liable for the proportionate
amount of such taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and
Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such taxes that is
attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. Apportioned Obligations shall be
timely paid, and all applicable filings, reports and returns shall be filed,
by Buyer or Seller as provided by applicable Law, provided that the paying
party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying party in
accordance with this Section 8.03. Upon payment of any such Apportioned
Obligation, the paying party shall present a statement to the non-paying party
setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is
entitled under this Section 8.03, together with such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying
party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than ten
(10) days after the presentation of such statement.

Section 8.04. Transfer Taxes. All excise, sales, use, value added,
registration stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing, transfer, and
similar Taxes, levies, charges and fees (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

hand. The party required to file any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes as
provided by applicable Law, shall timely prepare and file such Tax Returns and

remittance of such Transfer Taxes within ten (10) days after such filing and
remittance. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in the timely completion and
filing of all such Tax Returns.

assessment, audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such

the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such inquiry, investigation, claim assessment, audit, litigation or other
proceeding. Buyer and Seller (to the extent applicable) agree to (i) retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Governmental Authority and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
give such other Party reasonable written notice prior to destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if such other Party so requests,
Buyer and the Seller, as the case may be, shall allow such other Party to make
copies of or take possession of such books and records.

Section 8.06. Post-Closing Actions. Buyer and its Affiliates shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), amend, re-file, revoke or otherwise modify
any Tax Return or Tax election with respect to a Transferred Entity that would
be effective for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, except (i) to the extent required
by applicable Law or (ii) if such amendment, re-filing or modification could
not reasonably be expected to result in an increase in Taxes for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or an indemnification obligation of Seller pursuant to
Section 11.02.

Section 8.07. Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax
sharing agreements or similar contracts to which any of the Transferred

ARTICLE 9 
EMPLOYEE MATTERS AND BENEFITS

Section 9.01. ETFs Business Employees.

(a) Identified Business Employees. Buyer shall, not less than 10 Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, identify each ETFs Business Employee which it would
like to employ, and which will be set forth on Section 9.01(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (each, an "Identified Business Employee"). Prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall update Section 9.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule to (i) delete any such employee who should no longer be an Identified
Business Employee because Buyer provides written direction to make such
deletion, and (ii) add any ETFs Business Employee who becomes an Identified
Business Employee by written direction of Buyer. Immediately prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall take all necessary actions to (or cause
any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to) transfer the employment of each
Identified 

Business Employee to a Transferred Entity; provided that, if Seller reasonably
determines in good faith that the employment of any such Identified Business
Employee cannot be transferred to a Transferred Entity on or prior to the
Closing Date because of restrictions imposed by applicable Law or if such
Identified Business Employee is located in India (each such employee, a "Non-
Transferred Business Employee"), (i) Seller shall notify Buyer at least 5
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (ii) Buyer shall (or shall cause one
of its Subsidiaries to) make an offer of employment to such Non-Transferred
Business Employee on terms consistent with this Article 9 and (iii) Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate to cause such Non-Transferred Business Employee to
become Employed by Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries on, or as soon as
reasonably practicable following, the Closing Date. Each Identified Business
Employee who is transferred, or who accepts an offer of employment in the case
of a Non-Transferred Business Employee, according to this Section 9.01(a) and
who continues or commences, as applicable, active employment with Buyer or one
of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, a Transferred Entity) as of
his or her Transfer Date (as defined below) shall be referred to as a
"Transferred Employee").

(b) Transfer Dates. The employment of Transferred Employees with Buyer or one
of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities), as applicable, shall
be effective as of the Closing Date, except that in the case of a Non-
Transferred Business Employee, such employment shall be effective on the date
such employee commences employment with the Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries.
The date on which a Transferred Employee's employment with Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, becomes effective is hereafter referred to as
that Transferred Employee's "Transfer Date."

(c) Updating of ETFs Business Employee Information List. Seller shall provide
Buyer, not later than the tenth day of each month prior to the Closing Date,
with an updated ETFs Business Employee Information List that (i) contains the
information required under Section 3.13(e) with respect to each individual
whose information was not previously set forth on the ETFs Business Employee
Information List and who became an ETFs Business Employee during the preceding
month due to the mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer, or as otherwise
indicated by the Buyer in writing to the Seller as provided for in the
definition of ETFs Business Employee, and (ii) indicates each individual who
was previously set forth on the ETFs Business Employee Information List and
who is no longer an ETFs Business Employee. Seller shall provide Buyer with an
updated ETFs Business Employee Information List at least 5 days prior to the
Closing Date to reflect the required information as of the Closing Date,
including the most recent fiscal year Bonus Amounts, to the extent such
amounts have been paid or determined by the Seller in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.

(d) Severance. With respect to any ETFs Business Employee who does not become
a Transferred Employee (each, a "Retained Employee") and whose employment with
Seller and its Subsidiaries is terminated by Seller or its 

Subsidiaries during the 60 day period commencing on the Closing Date (or with
respect to any Retained Employee who is providing transition services pursuant
to the Transition Services Agreement, during the six (6) month period
commencing on the Closing Date) (the 60 day period together or the six month
period, as applicable, the "Shared Severance Window"), Buyer and Seller shall
each be responsible for 50% of any liabilities under a severance formula
mutually agreed in writing by the Buyer and the Seller at least 20 Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Transaction Severance Policy"). Other
than with regard to the Transaction Severance Policy, Seller shall retain
responsibility for any retention bonus, guaranteed bonus or other termination
or similar payments or benefits (collectively, "Severance Benefits") that may
be due to any Transferred Employee under any Benefit and Compensation
Arrangement, consistent with the provisions of Section 9.02(g). To the extent
applicable, any liability for Severance Benefits and the Transaction Severance
Policy for any Retained Employee terminated after the Shared Severance Window
shall be the responsibility of Seller and its Subsidiaries.

Section 9.02. Employee Matters.

(a) Continuation of Compensation and Benefits. For a period of not less than
one year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, provide to each Transferred Employee (i) a base salary or
wage rate that is no less than the base salary or wage rate provided to such
Transferred Employee by Seller and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) welfare, retirement and other employee benefits that are
substantially comparable to the welfare, retirement and other employee
benefits provided to employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries who are similarly
situated to such Transferred Employee.

(b) Variable Incentive Compensation. Buyer shall be responsible for the
payment of annual variable incentive compensation to the Transferred Employees
due in respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing takes place (the
"Closing Year Bonus Amounts"), and Buyer agrees that it or one of its
Subsidiaries shall provide the Transferred Employees with Closing Year Bonus
Amounts in an amount that, in the aggregate, is at least equal to the amount
of the Closing Year Bonus Accrual, provided that the terms and conditions of
such annual variable incentive compensation shall be substantially similar to
the terms and conditions of annual variable incentive compensation
opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of the Buyer. To the
extent Bonus Amounts have not already been paid to the Transferred Employees
in respect of the fiscal year prior to the Closing (any such amounts that
would otherwise be payable, the "Prior Year Bonus Amounts"), Buyer agrees to
pay to the Transferred Employees Prior Year Bonus Amounts that, in the
aggregate, are at least equal to the amount of the Prior Year Bonus Accrual
(which, if applicable, shall be in the amounts set forth on Section 3.13(e) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule as updated pursuant to Section 9.01(c)). The
term "Closing Year Bonus Accrual" shall mean the aggregate amount accrued in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice in accordance 

with GAAP, by Seller or its applicable Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date in
respect of the Closing Year Bonus Amounts in respect of the portion of the
fiscal year in which the Closing takes place; provided that in no event will
the Closing Year Bonus Accrual be less than the applicable pro rata portion of
the total Bonus Amounts paid in respect of the fiscal year immediately
preceding the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs. The term "Prior Year
Bonus Accrual" shall mean the aggregate amount accrued in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice in accordance with GAAP, by Seller or its
applicable Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date in respect of the Prior Year
Bonus Amounts provided that in no event will the Prior Year Bonus Accrual in
respect of the fiscal year prior to Closing be less than the total Bonus
Amount paid in respect of the immediately preceding fiscal year. The term
"Bonus Amount" means the amount of annual variable incentive compensation
(taking into account any amounts awarded on an annual basis as phantom equity)
payable to an individual Transferred Employee, in all cases as determined and
payable in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The
term "Bonus Accrual" shall mean the sum of Closing Year Bonus Accrual and the
Prior Year Bonus Accrual. To the extent the Bonus Accrual is not paid in full
by Buyer, Buyer agrees that it will pay unpaid amounts to Seller within ninety
(90) days following the date those amounts would otherwise be due.

(c) Credit for Service. With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or other compensation arrangement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any severance or vacation program or
policy) maintained or provided by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in which
any Transferred Employee becomes a participant, such Transferred Employee
shall receive full credit for all purposes for such Transferred Employee's
service with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers) to
the same extent that such service was recognized as of the Closing Date under
an analogous plan of Seller and its Subsidiaries in which the Transferred
Employee participated; provided that the foregoing shall not apply (i) with
respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan,(ii) to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits or (iii)
for newly adopted plans or awards for which past service is not granted to
participants generally. Subject to applicable Law and the provisions of this
Agreement, after the Closing Date, Buyer expressly reserves the right to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan or program established or
maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of Transferred
Employees in accordance with the terms of such plan or program and applicable
Law.

(d) Preexisting Conditions; Coordination. With respect to any group health
plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in which any Transferred
Employee is eligible to participate after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Transferred Employees and provide each
Transferred Employee (other than with respect to any high deductible health
plan with health savings accounts) 

with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid and for amounts paid
toward any out-of-pocket maximums prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
analogous plan's deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent
applicable under any such plan .

(e) Paid Time-Off. Seller shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to,
pay each Transferred Employee for any vacation time earned but unused by such
Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date, which payment shall be made on or
as soon as is reasonably practicable following the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred
Entities) shall retain and be responsible for liabilities in respect of the
earned and unused vacation time of the Transferred Employees.

(f) Vesting of Qualified Plan Benefits. Effective as of the Closing, Seller
shall cause each Transferred Employee to become fully vested in his or her
benefit accrued under any Benefit and Compensation Arrangement intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code but only to the extent
such vesting does not result in discrimination in favor of highly compensated
employees under Section 401(a)(4) of the Code.

(g) Employee Liabilities. Except as specifically set forth in this Article 9,
the Seller shall retain and be responsible for all liabilities relating to or
in connection with any ETFs Business Employees, any Benefit and Compensation
Arrangement, and any other compensation or benefit plan, program and policy
maintained, sponsored or contributed to or required to be contributed to by
the Seller or any of its Affiliates or under or with respect to which the
Seller of any of its Affiliates has any liabilities (whether individually or
jointly and severally). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have no
responsibility with respect to any liabilities relating to or in connection
with the Transferred Employees or any compensation or benefit plan, program
and policy (other than a Benefit and Compensation Arrangement) maintained,
sponsored or contributed to or required to be contributed to by the
Transferred Entities or any labor- or employment-related matters relating to
the Transferred Entities, in any case arising after the Closing or in the case
of a Transferred Employee, if later, the Employee's Transfer Date.

(h) Non-U.S. Employees. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, with respect to any Transferred Employee located in a
non-U.S. jurisdiction, the obligations and covenants of Buyer under this
Section 9.02 with respect to such employee shall be subject to applicable law
and with respect to any obligation relating to a plan, policy or other
arrangement with a third-party vendor or otherwise, to the extent commercially
reasonably available.

Section 9.03. No Amendment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the
generality of Section 13.08, nothing in this Article 9, whether express or
implied, (a) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
Benefit and Compensation Arrangement or other employee benefit plan, agreement
or other arrangement, (b) shall limit the right of Buyer or its 

Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any employee benefit
plan, agreement or other arrangement following the Closing Date or (c) shall
confer upon any other Person who is not a party to this Agreement (including
any ETFs Business Employee or any participant in any Benefit and Compensation
Arrangement or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement (or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof)) any right to continued or resumed
employment or recall, any right to compensation or benefits, or any third-
party beneficiary or other right of any kind or nature whatsoever.

("Third Party Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such
Section. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third Party
Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information
then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.

(b) Except as provided below, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
control and select counsel (subject to the Indemnified Party's right to
reasonably object) for such defense at its expense.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld)
before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the
settlement does not release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim, the settlement is in
excess of the maximum liability set forth in Section 11.02, or the settlement
imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party and
(ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume such control, and shall be responsible for the
fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party's counsel, if the Indemnifying
Party shall have failed, within 15 Business Days after receipt of a Notice in
respect of the applicable Third Party Claim, to assume the defense of such
claim or to notify the Indemnified Party in writing that it will assume the
defense of such claim and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for
the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party's counsel if (A) the named
parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall
have been advised in writing by counsel that there may be one or more legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are not available to, or the
assertion of which would be adverse to the interests of, the Indemnifying
Party or (B) the Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by
counsel that the assumption of such defense by the Indemnifying Party would be
inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest absent
representation by the Indemnified Party by its own counsel (provided that the
Indemnifying Party shall 

not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of counsel for
all Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel).

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Section 11.04. Tax Contest. (a) If any claim or demand for Taxes in respect of
which an indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 11.02 is asserted in
writing against an Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand within 10 days of receipt thereof,
or such earlier time that would allow the Indemnifying Party to timely respond
to such claim or demand, and shall give the Indemnifying Party such
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request; provided, however, that the failure to give such prompt notice shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations under this
Section 11.04, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party may discharge, at any time, its
indemnification obligation under this Section 11.04 by paying to the
Indemnified Party the amount of such claim for Taxes, calculated on the date
of such payment. The Indemnifying Party may, at its own expense, participate
in and, upon notice to the Indemnified Party, assume the defense of any such
claim, suit, action, litigation or proceeding (including any Tax audit). If
the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the sole discretion as to the conduct of such defense; provided, however, that
the Indemnifying Party may not settle, abandon or compromise any such claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such settlement,
abandonment or compromise would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or
prosecute any claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof.

(b) Any payment by the Indemnifying Party of indemnified Taxes pursuant to
Section 11.02 shall be made in immediately available funds at least two
Business Days before the date payment of the Taxes to which such payment
relates is due, or, if no Tax is payable, not later than 10 days after receipt
by the Indemnifying Party of written notice from the Indemnified Party stating
that any Damages have been paid by the Indemnified Party and the amount
thereof and of the indemnity payment requested.

Section 11.05. Direct Claim Procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party has
a claim for indemnity under Section 11.02 against an Indemnifying 

Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees
to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

Section 11.06. Calculation of Damages. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of (i) any amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor (net of
any deductible or any expenses incurred in securing such recovery), and (ii)
any Tax benefit arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages,
which shall be netted against any Damages payable under Section 11.02 by the
Indemnifying Party, or repaid by the Indemnified Party, only if, as and when
such Tax benefit is actually realized in cash or a reduction in Taxes
otherwise due. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any
Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party,
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party
for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party, net of any deductible or expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for any (i)
punitive Damages (except to the extent included in any Third Party Claim) or
(ii) consequential Damages, including for lost profits, that, in the case of
this clause (ii), are remote or not reasonably foreseeable (except to the
extent included in any Third Party Claim).

(c) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts
available under insurance coverage for any Damages payable under Section
11.02, provided that the expenses of such efforts shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Party and such efforts will not limit the timing or amount of
Damages payable under Section 11.02 during pendency of such insurance claims.

Section 11.07. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of
such Damages from a third party that is not a current or former client,
customer, employee, officer or director of Buyer and its Affiliates (a
"Potential Contributor") based on the underlying Claim asserted against the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law or contract, assign such of its rights to proceed against the
Potential Contributor as 

are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

Section 11.08. Exclusivity. After the Closing, Section 11.02 and Section 13.12
will provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty, covenant or other agreement (other than those contained in Sections
2.04, 7.12, 9.02(b) and 9.02(g) and Article VIII) or other claim arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except in the case
of common law fraud relating to claims made in respect of the representations
or warranties contained herein.



ARTICLE 12 
TERMINATION

Section 12.01. Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

(b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated
on or before the first anniversary of the date hereof (the "Long-Stop Date");
provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
12.01(b) shall not be available to any party whose material breach of any
provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to be
consummated by such date;

(c) by either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or
judgment of any Government Entity having competent jurisdiction; or

(d) by either party, if the other party breaches or fails to perform or comply
with its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 10.03(a) or (b) or Section 10.01(a) or (b), as
applicable, and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within forty-five (45)
days after the giving of written notice to the other party of such breach;
provided that the such breach or failure was not caused by or substantially
contributed to by the terminating party and the terminating party is not then
in breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement that would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 10.03(a) or (b) or Section 10.01(a) or (b), as applicable.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(b),
Section 12.01(c) or Section 12.01(d) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party. 

Section 12.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of
either party (or any Affiliate, stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; provided that, if such termination shall result from the
intentional (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the
performance of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure to perform a
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, such party shall be fully
liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a
result of any intentional failure or breach. The provisions of this Section
12.02 and Sections 7.10, 13.03, 13.05, 13.06, 13.07, and 13.09 and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to
Section 12.01.

permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court

Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each

Government Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain

invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible. 

Section 13.11. Disclosure Schedules. The parties hereto agree that any

warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other

readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that reference and such
representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part
of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed. The parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the Schedules to this Agreement may include certain items
and information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer
or Seller, as applicable and (ii) the disclosure by Seller or Buyer, as
