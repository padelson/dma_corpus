parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts, this being in
addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to this Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection therewith. The parties acknowledge and agree that each party hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent and

contemporaneously with the consummation of the Tender Offer, (B)&nbsp;the Forward Purchase Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and (C)&nbsp;the Forward Purchasers have not indicated to Parent in writing their intention not to consummate

those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied, (ii)&nbsp;Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2, and
(iii)&nbsp;the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing is funded, the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
