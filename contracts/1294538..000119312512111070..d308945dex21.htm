follows:

ARTICLE I

THE TENDER OFFER

 

Section 1.1 _The Tender Offer_.

(a) If this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with
Article VIII, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event no more
than five Business Days following the date hereof (but subject to applicable
Law), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Common Stock
at the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub, and of Parent to cause
Merger Sub, to accept for payment and pay for any shares of Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer shall be subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit
A_ hereto (the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ ") and the terms and conditions
hereof. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
waive any Tender Offer Condition, in whole or in part, at any time or from
time to time, or to modify the terms or conditions of the Tender Offer, except
that, without the written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i)
reduce the Offer Price except in accordance with Section 3.1(d), (ii) change
the

 



2  form of consideration payable in the Tender Offer (other than by adding
consideration), (iii) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
the Tender Offer, (iv) waive or change the Minimum Condition, (v) add to, or
impose conditions on the Tender Offer other than, the Tender Offer Conditions,
(vi) extend the expiration of the Tender Offer except (A) as required or
permitted by Section 1.1(b), (B) as required by applicable Law or (C) in
connection with an increase in the Offer Price, or (vii) modify any Tender
Offer Condition or any term of the Tender Offer set forth in this Agreement in
a manner adverse to the holders of shares of Common Stock or that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Tender Offer or prevent, materially
delay or impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Tender
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , nothing herein shall limit the ability of Merger Sub
to elect to extend the Tender Offer after the acceptance of shares of Common
Stock to provide for a Subsequent Offering Period. Either Parent or Merger Sub
may, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the consent of the
Company, increase the Offer Price, in which case the Tender Offer shall
be extended, without the consent of the Company, as required by applicable
Law. The Company agrees that no shares of Common Stock held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Tender Offer; _provided_ that
for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing limitation does not apply to the
shares of Common Stock held in trust to fund obligations under the Companys
Deferred Compensation Plan.

 

(b) The Tender Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at 9:00 a.m., New
York time, on the date that is 21 Business Days (determined in accordance
with Rule 14d 1(g)(3) of the Exchange Act) after commencement of the Tender
Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial
Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to this Agreement, the date and
time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or
such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended pursuant to this Agreement, is referred to as the "
_Expiration Date_ "). If at the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent
Expiration Date, any Tender Offer Condition, including the Delaying Condition,
is not satisfied or waived, then Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, extend the Tender Offer for at least five (5) but not greater
than ten (10) Business Days (the length of such period to be determined,
subject to applicable Law, in the sole discretion of Merger Sub); _provided_ ,
that such extension does not extend beyond the Termination Date. In addition,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Tender
Offer on one or more occasions for the minimum period required by any rule,
regulation or interpretation of the SEC, or the staff thereof, applicable to
the Tender Offer, _provided_ , that such extension does not extend beyond the
Termination Date. To the extent the Change of Control Offer has not terminated
and the Delaying Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Tender Offer so
that the Expiration Date is co-terminus with the scheduled expiration time of
the Change of Control Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that such extension
does not extend beyond five (5) Business Days prior to the Termination Date.
To the extent the Change of Control Offer has not terminated and (A) Parent
has not received the Requisite Notes Consent and (B) the Forward Purchase
Commitment Letter shall have been terminated or the Forward

 



3  Purchasers shall have indicated to Parent in writing their intention not to
consummate their obligations thereunder with respect to the Change of Control
Offer or Parent or its Affiliate shall not be able to obtain the Forward
Purchase Commitment promptly following the Acceptance Time, Merger Sub may,
but shall not be required to, extend the Tender Offer on one or more occasions
in increments of at least five (5) but not greater than ten (10) Business
Days (the length of such period to be determined, subject to applicable Law,
in the sole discretion of Merger Sub); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
extension(s) does not extend beyond the Termination Date. Merger Sub may,
without the consent of the Company and in its sole discretion, extend the
Tender Offer for up to ten (10) Business Days beyond the then scheduled
expiration date of the Tender Offer up to the Termination Date, if the Company
shall have received a Takeover Proposal or an Adverse Recommendation Change
occurs. The Offer Price shall, subject to applicable withholding of taxes as
set forth in Section 3.2(f), be net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Tender Offer. Merger Sub shall pay for all
shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn promptly following
the acceptance of the shares of Common Stock for payment pursuant to the
Tender Offer. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and subject
to the applicable rules of the SEC and the terms and conditions of the Tender
Offer, Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to delay payment for shares of
Common Stock in order to comply in whole or in part with applicable Laws. Any
such delay shall be effected in compliance with the Exchange Act. Merger Sub
may extend the Tender Offer after the acceptance of shares of Common Stock
thereunder for a further period of time by means of a subsequent offering
period under Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act (a " _Subsequent
Offering Period_ ") of not more than 20 Business Days to meet the objective
that there be validly tendered, in accordance with the terms of the
Tender Offer, prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer (as so extended),
and not withdrawn a number of shares of Common Stock which, together with
shares of Common Stock then owned by Parent and Merger Sub, represents at
least 90% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock. If the payment
equal to the Offer Price in cash is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing shares of
Common Stock is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it
shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and similar taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Offer Price to a person other than
the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Merger Sub that such taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable.

(c) Subject to the terms of the Tender Offer and this Agreement and the
satisfaction of all of the Tender Offer Conditions, Merger Sub will accept
for payment and pay for all shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer as soon as practicable after
the scheduled expiration date thereof (as the same may be extended or
required to be extended) or, in the case of any shares of Common Stock
tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period, as soon as practicable
following the valid tender thereof. Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase and

 



4  pay for any and all shares of Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated
to accept for payment and purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer and shall
cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger Subs covenants, agreements and
obligations in respect of the Tender Offer and this Agreement, in each case to
the extent such covenants and payment obligations are to be performed or made
at or prior to Closing.

 

(d) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ prior
to the Acceptance Time, then Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, promptly (and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Tender Offer and
in any event shall not acquire any shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto.
If the Tender Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ prior to the
Acceptance Time, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause
any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with
applicable Law, all tendered shares of Common Stock to the registered holders
thereof.

Section 1.2 _Tender Offer Documents_. As promptly as reasonably practicable on
the date of commencement of the Tender Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (a)
file a combined Tender Offer Statement under cover of Schedule TO (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with
respect to the Tender Offer, which shall (i) be in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (provided the Company completes its review and
provides it comments thereto in a timely manner), (ii) comply in all material
respects with all applicable federal securities Laws and (iii) contain or
shall incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to

documents, together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Tender Offer Documents_ ") and (b) cause the Tender Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Tender Offer Documents
will contain all information that is required to be included therein in
accordance with the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder,
and under any applicable Laws. The Company shall promptly supply Parent and
Merger Sub in writing, for inclusion in the Tender Offer Documents, all
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Companys
stockholders that may be required under the Exchange Act or reasonably
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.2 to
be included in the Tender Offer Documents. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Tender Offer Documents of the Fairness Opinion and all other
material disclosure relating to the Company Financial Advisor (including the
fees and other consideration that the Company Financial Advisor will receive
upon consummation of the Tender Offer and the Merger). Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it
for use in the Tender Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
each of Parent and Merger Sub further agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Tender Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and
to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders,

 



5  in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to

prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and Parent shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent agrees to provide
the Company and its counsel any written comments that Parent may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Tender Offer Documents promptly after
the receipt of such comments, and any written responses thereto, and to
promptly inform them of any oral comments or other communications. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon any written responses and to participate in any oral responses
and Parent shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes, as applicable, suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel.

Section 1.3 _Company Actions_.

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Tender Offer and to the inclusion in
the Tender Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation (subject only
to the Companys right to rescind, modify or withdraw the Company Board
Recommendation in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.5).

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC and
to mail to the Companys stockholders on the date of filing by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Tender Offer Documents (and in any event not later than the
later of (i) five days following the date hereof and (ii) the date of filing
by Parent and Merger Sub of the Tender Offer Documents) a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (such Schedule 14D-9,
together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ")
containing the Company Board Recommendation and the Fairness Opinion, and
shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the Companys
stockholders (concurrently with and in the same mailing envelope as the Tender
Offer Documents) as required by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act. Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Merger Sub that is required under the Exchange Act or reasonably
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.3 to
be included in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders,
in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Law. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments
thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and the Company shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. In addition, the Company
agrees to provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel any written comments
that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff

 



6  with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
comments, and any written responses thereto, and to promptly inform them of
any oral comments or other communications. Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any
written responses and to participate in any oral responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes, as applicable, suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel.

(c) In connection with the Tender Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer
agent promptly (but in any event not later than three Business Days following
the date hereof) to furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels,
security position listings, any non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any
available listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the
record holders of shares of Common Stock as of the most recent practicable
date and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such additional available
information (including periodic updates of such information) and such other
assistance as Parent, Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably request in
communicating the Tender Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
shares of Common Stock. Upon Parents reasonable request and subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, the Company shall cause its Representatives to

and recommendations to the holders of shares of Common Stock for purposes of
causing the Minimum Condition to be satisfied, including, upon Parents
request, together with Parent and Merger Sub, jointly preparing a presentation
to RiskMetrics Group or such other proxy advisory firm as designated by
Parent to recommend this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Tender Offer and the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub shall, and
shall cause their agents to treat the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such information prior to Closing only in
connection with the Tender Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall

destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or under their
control or in the possession or under the control of any of their
representatives or agents in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Section 1.4 _Directors_.

 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the acceptance
for payment by Merger Sub of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Tender
Offer representing at least such number of shares of Common Stock as shall
satisfy the Minimum Condition (the time of such acceptance, the " _Acceptance
Time_ "), and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to
the Company Board as is equal to the product of the total number of directors
on the Company Board (determined after giving effect to the directors elected
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage of the total number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock at such time represented by the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent or its
Affiliates at such time (including shares of Common Stock so accepted for
payment);

 



7   _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be entitled to designate at
least a majority of the directors on the Company Board as long as Parent and
its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the shares of Common Stock of
the Company. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request of
Parent, promptly take all actions necessary to cause Parents designees to be
so elected or appointed by the incumbent directors of the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company (as applicable) prior to the Acceptance Time,
including increasing the size of the Company Board and/or securing the
resignations of one or more incumbent directors and/or filling any vacancies
so created with Parents designees. At such time, the Company shall, upon
request of Parent, also promptly take, and cause any incumbent directors of
the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company (as applicable) prior to the
Acceptance Time to take, all actions necessary to cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to
the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the
Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each
Subsidiary of the Company (including in the case of GWR Operating Partnership,
L.L.L.P. taking any actions necessary to cause Parents designees to become
"Continuing Directors" as such term is defined in the 2017 First Mortgage
Indenture) and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in
each case, subject to applicable Law and, if applicable, the rules and
regulations of the Applicable Exchange.

 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder. The Company shall promptly take, at its expense, all actions
required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.4, including mailing to stockholders the
information required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 not later than such
time as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be elected or appointed
to the Company Board at the Acceptance Time. Parent shall supply to the
Company and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself
and its officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required by Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the any materials required to
be filed with the SEC or mailed to security holders pursuant to Section 14(f)
or Rule 14f-1 and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC and mailing thereof to security holders and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The provisions of this
Section 1.4 are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner
of shares of Common Stock as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise.

 

(c) If Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board
pursuant to this Section 1.4, then, until the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least three directors who are
members of the Company Board on the date of this Agreement and who are
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act (the "
_Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the number of
Independent Directors is reduced below three for any reason, the remaining
Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to nominate an individual 

 



8  or individuals to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then
remain, the other directors shall promptly (and in any event within ten
Business Days) designate three individuals to fill such vacancies who are
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and such
individuals shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that if no such Independent Director is appointed in
such time period, Parent shall designate such Independent Director(s). The
Company and the Company Board shall promptly take all action as may
be necessary to comply with their obligations under this Section 1.4(c).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the
time, if any, that Parents designees pursuant to this Section 1.4 constitute
a majority of the Company Board and prior to the Effective Time, subject to
the terms hereof, (i) any amendment, modification or termination of this
Agreement by the Company, (ii) any extension by the Company of the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger
Sub hereunder, (iii) any waiver of any condition to the Companys obligations
hereunder or any of the Companys rights hereunder, (iv) any amendment to the
Company Organizational Documents that adversely affects or would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the stockholders of the Company (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates) (v) any Adverse Recommendation
Change or (vi) any other action of the Company in connection the Merger,
which adversely affects or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates), will require the concurrence of a majority of the Independent
Directors (or in the case where there are two or fewer Independent Directors,
the concurrence of all Independent Directors). The Independent Directs shall
have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel
to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as reasonably
determined by the Independent Directors and shall have the authority to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this
Agreement or any of the Companys rights hereunder, in each case until the
Closing. Following the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, unless
required by applicable Law or applicable fiduciary duties, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall take any action to remove any Independent Director.

Section 1.5 _The Top-Up Option._  

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ ") to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-
Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Common Stock that, when
added to the number of shares of Common Stock held by Parent and Merger Sub at
the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the
total shares of Common Stock then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted
basis and assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares), at a price per Common
Share equal to the Offer Price.

 

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Merger Sub once in whole and not
in part on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the later of the
Acceptance Time and the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period, if
applicable, if at such time, Parent, Merger Sub and any Subsidiary of Parent
or Merger Sub do not own

 



9  in the aggregate at least 90% of the total shares of Common Stock then
outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of the Company to
deliver the Top-Up Shares is subject to the conditions that (i) no judgment,
injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Authority shall prohibit the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect
of such exercise; (ii) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a
number of shares of Common Stock in excess of the number of authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock (including as authorized and unissued shares
of Common Stock, for purposes of this Section 1.5, any shares of Common Stock
held in the treasury of the Company); and (iii) Merger Sub has accepted for
payment and paid for all shares of Common Stock validly tendered in the Tender
Offer and not withdrawn; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-Up Option
shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (A) the Effective Time and (B)
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon exercise
of the Top-Up Option, Parent covenants to cause the Closing to occur
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares is accomplished as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
exercise of the Top-Up Option and in a manner consistent with applicable Law,
including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the
Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ ").

 

(c) If Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall so
notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the
number of shares of Common Stock that will be owned by Parent and Merger Sub
immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, and (ii) the place
and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (the " _Top-Up
Closing_ " and the date of such closing, " _Top-Up Closing Date_ "), which
shall take place not later than five Business Days following the Acceptance
Time or the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period. The Company shall,
as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice (and in no event later
than the Top-Up Closing Date), notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing of the
number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and the number of Top-
Up Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares and the Company
shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up
Shares, which certificate may include any legends required by applicable
securities Laws. The aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares
shall be paid by Merger Sub or Parent by (A) paying in cash, by wire transfer
of readily available funds, an amount equal to not less than the aggregate
par value of the Top-Up Shares and (B) executing and delivering to the Company
a promissory note (the " _Promissory Note_ ") having a principal amount equal
to the aggregate cash purchase price for the Top-Up Shares less the amount
paid in cash pursuant to clause (A). The Promissory Note shall bear interest
at the rate of interest per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing
from time to time during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal,
shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of
such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. Merger Sub
and the Company hereby agree that in any appraisal proceeding described
in Section 3.4 hereof, that the fair value of the Dissenting Shares subject
to the appraisal proceeding shall be determined in accordance with the DGCL
without regard to the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Shares or the Promissory Note.

 



10 (d) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise
the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement may be exercised only
once and shall not be assigned by Merger Sub except in connection with an
assignment in compliance with Section 9.16. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this Section 1.5(d) shall be null and void.

(e) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to
be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued shares of
Common Stock or any shares of Common Stock held in its treasury, the number of
shares of Common Stock that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full
of the Top-Up Option pursuant to this Section 1.5 in addition to the number
of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options,
rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued
by the Company.

Law.

 

ARTICLE III

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub or the
Company:

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Common Stock owned or held in treasury by the Company or any Wholly-

 



12  Owned Subsidiary or by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company or any of its Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries) immediately before the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be canceled
automatically without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or distribution shall be paid or made for those Excluded Shares.

 

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_.

(i) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash,
without interest and subject to applicable withholding tax as set forth in
Section 3.2(f) (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(ii) All shares of Common Stock that have been converted pursuant to Section
3.1(c)(i) shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of (A) certificates which immediately before the Effective Time
represented such shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B) shares represented by
book-entry (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect to those shares, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.2.

(d) _Equitable Adjustment_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (i) any change in the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible into,
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock, shall occur as a
result of any stock split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
Common Stock) is declared with a record date during such period, then the
Merger Consideration and the Offer Price shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change and (ii) any Rights (as defined in the Rights Plan)
are exercised or any dividends or distributions are made, set aside, paid or
declared with respect to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock,
then the Merger Consideration and the Offer Price shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect such change, in each case such that the aggregate consideration
payable (taking into account any such stock splits, combinations, dividends or
distributions) to shareholders is the same as prior to such event.

 

Section 3.2 _Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than three Business Days before the Effective
Time, Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company, satisfactory to the
Company in its reasonable discretion, to act as the paying agent for the
payment of the amounts to be paid pursuant to this Article III (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent,
the terms and conditions of which are satisfactory to the Company in its
reasonable discretion. Parent shall be responsible for all fees and expenses
of the Paying Agent.

 



13 (b) _Payment Fund_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited (including deposits by the Company in accordance with Section
6.14 if deemed appropriate by Parent), with the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for payment in accordance
with this  _Article III_ through the Paying Agent, sufficient funds for the
payment of (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (ii) sufficient funds
for the aggregate amount payable by the Company under Section 3.3, which
amount shall then be paid by the Paying Agent to the Company. Such funds
provided to the Paying Agent are referred to as the " _Payment Fund_."

(c) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as possible after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a share of Common Stock converted pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i), (A) a letter
of transmittal in customary form, specifying that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to such holders shares shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal and (B) instructions for surrendering such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(ii) _Surrender of Shares_. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of a Book-Entry
Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal, and any other documents reasonably
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of that Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay in
exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number
of shares formerly evidenced by that Certificate or such Book-Entry Share less
any required withholding of Taxes. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be canceled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be
paid on any amount payable upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, then the Merger Consideration may be paid to such a transferee so
long as (A) the surrendered Certificate is accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by Parent to evidence and effect that transfer and (B) the
Person requesting such payment (x) pays any applicable transfer or similar
Taxes or (y) establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the
Paying Agent that any such transfer or similar Taxes have already been paid or
are not applicable.

(iv) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
3.2(c), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share and, in the case of a Certificate, the shares of Common
Stock formerly represented by it.

 



14 (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the execution and delivery
by such Person of a customary indemnity agreement to provide indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration to such
Person in respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by
such Certificate.

(e) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time.

(f) _Required Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.
The parties agree that the Common Stock is regularly traded on an established
securities market as defined in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1445-2(c)(2)
and 1.897-9T(d) and shall not take any action inconsistent therewith
(including for purposes of withholding pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code
on consideration payable under this Agreement). To the extent that any amounts
are so deducted and withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities,
those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction or withholding was made for all purposes under this
Agreement.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investment shall be in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United
States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion. Any such investment shall be for
the benefit, and at the risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income
resulting from such investment shall be for the benefit of Parent; _provided_
, that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common Stock

 



15  immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount of any such losses to
the extent necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Article III. 

(i) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent upon demand. Thereafter, any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not complied with this
Article III shall look only to the Surviving Corporation, which shall remain
responsible for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed
by holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any Liens,
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 3.3 _Company Options, Restricted Shares and Stock Unit Awards_.

 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Time, the Company
Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
the Company shall take all necessary actions (including providing all required
notices and using reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of individual
holders, if required), to provide that as of the Effective Time, each
option to acquire shares of Common Stock (each, a " _Company Option_ ")
outstanding and unexercised immediately before the Effective Time, whether or
not then exercisable or vested, by virtue of the Closing and without any
additional action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that
Company Option, shall be canceled for no consideration.

(b) The Company Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board
shall adopt resolutions on the date of this Agreement and thereafter the
Company shall take all necessary actions (including, without limitation,
providing all required notices and using reasonable best efforts to obtain
the consent of individual holders, if required), to provide that (i) with
respect to each performance-based multi-year program equity grant made under
the Great Wolf Resorts, Inc. 2004 Incentive Plan in calendar years prior to
2012 and that is outstanding on the date of this Agreement (each, a "
_Pre-2012 Stock Unit Award_ "), the Company shall convert such Pre-2012 Stock
Unit Awards into shares of restricted Common Stock, which shall be subject to
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Pre-2012 Stock Unit
Awards immediately prior to such conversion (which terms and conditions, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall include the time-based vesting restrictions
that would have been applicable to Pre-2012 Stock Unit Awards that would have
been earned and converted into Restricted Shares in accordance with the terms
of the Pre-2012 Stock Unit Awards); (ii) with respect to each share of
restricted Common Stock outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, with
those outstanding being determined after giving effect to the conversion
contemplated by

 



16  the preceding clause (i), (collectively, " _Restricted Shares_ "), which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall include Restricted Shares granted in
settlement of annual equity grant awards and service-based multi-year
performance equity grant awards, the Company shall make such amendments as are
necessary to grant agreements, certificates, book entries, Company records and
any other documents, to permit such Restricted Shares to be tendered in the
Tender Offer; (iii) each holder of Restricted Shares pursuant to clauses (i)
and (ii) above shall have the right to tender such Restricted Shares into the
Tender Offer and, upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, such tendered
Restricted Shares shall become fully vested and, subject to withholding
pursuant to Section 3.3(d), shall be treated the same as other shares of
Common Stock properly tendered in the Tender Offer; and (iv) each Restricted
Share which is not tendered in the Tender Offer in accordance with clause
(iii) above, shall become fully vested at the Acceptance Time and, upon the
Effective Time, shall be cancelled and converted into, and shall thereafter
only represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 3.1(c).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.3(b), no annual
equity grant awards or multi-year program equity grant awards granted in 2012
shall be converted into Restricted Shares or shall otherwise be eligible to
participate in the Tender Offer, and all such awards shall immediately expire
and become null and void immediately prior to the Effective Time if the
Effective Time occurs in 2012, with no consideration due therefor. At the
Effective Time, all Company Option Plans and Company Stock Plans shall
terminate.

(d) The payment of any amounts pursuant to Section 3.3(b) shall be reduced by
any income or employment Tax withholding required under the Code or any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law and may be made through the Company
or its Subsidiaries payroll system. To the extent that any amounts are so
withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, those amounts shall
be treated as having been paid to the holder of that Restricted Share for all
purposes under this Agreement. The Company shall: (i) implement the provisions
of Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.3(b) and (ii) ensure that all Company
Options, Restricted Shares, annual equity grant awards and multi-year program
equity grant awards, including the Pre-2012 Stock Unit Awards are canceled and
all Company Option Plans and Company Stock Plans terminate at the Acceptance
Time or Effective Time, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.3(a),
Section 3.3(b) and Section 3.3(c).

(e) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver
to each holder of Company Options, Restricted Shares, annual equity grant
awards and multi-year program equity grant awards, including the Pre-2012
Stock Unit Awards, a letter describing the treatment of and, if applicable,
payment for such Company Options, Restricted Shares , annual equity grant
awards and multi-year program equity grant awards, including the
Pre-2012 Stock Unit Awards pursuant to this Section 3.3 and providing
instructions for use in obtaining payment for Restricted Shares (which
instructions shall provide that the cash payable to such holder pursuant to
this Section 3.3 may be, at the election of such holder, mailed to such
holder or transferred to such holder by wire transfer). The Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable,

 



17  shall, at all times from and after the Acceptance Time maintain sufficient
liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of Restricted Shares
pursuant to this Section 3.3. The Company shall take all reasonable steps to
facilitate the ability of employees to tender their Restricted Shares and any
other shares of Common Stock in the Tender Offer.

(f) As promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time and in any event
not later than the third Business Day thereafter, the Company shall pay
through its payroll system to each applicable holder of Restricted Shares,
such amount due and payable, if any to such holder pursuant to Section 3.3(b)
in respect of such Restricted Shares.

Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.4), any shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for which the holder
thereof (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented to it in
writing and (ii) has properly demanded the appraisal of such shares in
accordance with, and has complied in all respects with, the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 3.1(c). At the Effective Time, (A) all Dissenting Shares shall be
canceled and cease to exist and (B) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.4(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holders shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and
(ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal, in each case in accordance with Section 3.2.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any shares of Common Stock, the withdrawals of such
demands and any other instrument served on the Company under the DGCL and
(ii) the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands for appraisal. Except to the extent required by
applicable Law, the Company shall not offer to make or make any payment with
respect to any such demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demand for appraisal without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned in the case
of any payment made prior to the Closing Date.

 



18 ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in (x) the corresponding sections of the disclosure
letter delivered by the Company to Parent before the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter
(whether or not an explicit cross reference appears) shall be deemed to be
disclosure with respect to any other section of the Company Disclosure Letter
and any other representation or warranty made elsewhere in Article IV, in
either case, to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent from
the face of such disclosure or (y) the Company SEC Reports filed after
December 31, 2011 (other than any Company SEC Reports filed after the date
hereof and excluding any risk factor disclosures and any forward-looking
statements or other statements that are cautionary or forward-looking in
nature), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

 

Section 4.1 _Organization and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and has the requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business
as now conducted. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
or reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each of
the Subsidiaries of the Company is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has
the requisite power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to
own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business
as now conducted.

Section 4.2 _Foreign Qualifications_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, limited liability
company or other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where such qualification is necessary, except where failure to be so qualified
or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.3 _Corporate Authorization_. The Company has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and, solely with respect to the consummation of the
Merger, subject to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote (unless the
Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL), to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company Board
at a meeting duly called and held has unanimously (including a majority of
disinterested directors): (a) approved and declared advisable this Agreement,
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Tender Offer, (b) declared that it is in the best interests of the
stockholders of the Company that the Company enter into this Agreement and
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (c)

 



19  directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a
meeting of the stockholders of the Company (unless the Merger is consummated
in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated in Section 6.6(e))
and (d) resolved and agreed to recommend to the stockholders of the Company
that they accept the Tender Offer, tender their Common Stock into the Tender
Offer and vote in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Tender Offer and the
Merger (if required by applicable Law), in each case, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (this clause (d), the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ "), and such approvals are sufficient such that
the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203(a) of the
DGCL and any other Takeover Law shall not apply for any purpose to Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Section 552.05 of the Wisconsin
Statutes is not applicable to the Agreement, the Tender Offer or the Merger
because the Company is not a target company that meets the requirements of
Section 552.05(7) of the Wisconsin Statutes. Other than Section 203(a) of the
DGCL, there are no other Takeover Laws applicable to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming that the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section
5.5(c) are true and correct and either the Requisite Company Vote is received
or the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as
contemplated in Section 6.6(e), the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The
Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of each of the
Company Organizational Documents, in each case as amended to the date of this
Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of the
Company Organizational Documents, in each case, in any material respect. The
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the minutes
of all meetings of the Company Board (and each committee thereof) and of the
stockholders of the Company, in each case since January 1, 2009 and in the
form approved by the Company Board or a committee thereof, as applicable;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to make available to, and
has not made available to, Parent or any designee thereof any portions of any
minutes for any meetings that discuss the Tender Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any current or prior
alternatives thereto considered by the Company Board or any such committee.

 

Section 4.4 _Enforceability_. This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
binding agreement of the Company, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

Section 4.5 _Subsidiaries_. Section 4.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company, indicating
its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation. Each of the Subsidiaries of
the Company (other than Creative Kingdoms, LLC) is wholly-owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Liens (other than
Permitted Liens). The Company owns, directly or indirectly, 62.4% of all of
the membership interest of Creative Kingdoms,

 



20  LLC, which membership interest is free and clear of any Liens (other than
Permitted Liens). The Company and its Subsidiaries own 49% of the membership
interests of CTGW, LLC (the " _Chehalis Joint Venture_ ") free and clear of
any Liens other than Permitted Liens. Except for the capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries and the Chehalis Joint
Venture, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any equity,
membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest, or other
equity or voting interest in, or any interest convertible into, exercisable or
exchangeable for any of the foregoing.

 

Section 4.6 _Governmental Authorizations_. Assuming that the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 5.3 are true and
correct, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement do not and will not require any consent, approval or other
authorization of, or filing with or notification to (collectively, "
_Governmental Authorizations_ "), any Governmental Authority, other than:

(a) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware;

(b) the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") of
(i) a proxy statement (the " _Company Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the
special meeting of the stockholders of the Company to be held to consider the
adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "), if
necessary, (ii) the Tender Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 and (iii) any
other filings and reports that may be required in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;

 

(c) any filings and reports that may be required in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under state
securities Laws or "blue sky" Laws (including Section 552.07 of the Wisconsin
Statutes);

(d) compliance with the Applicable Exchange rules and regulations; and

(e) where the failure to obtain such Governmental Authorizations would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.7 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not and will not (a)
contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
provision of (i) the Company Organizational Documents, (ii) the Companys
Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws or comparable
governing documents or (iii) the certificate of formation or limited liability
company agreement or comparable governing documents of the Chehalis

 



21  Joint Venture or any other Company Financing Party, (b) contravene or
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any Law applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any assets of the Company,
any of the Companys Subsidiaries, the Chehalis Joint Venture or any other
Company Financing Party (" _Company Assets_ ") are bound, assuming that all
Governmental Authorizations described in Section 4.6 have been obtained or
made, (c) except as set forth in Section 4.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
result in any violation or breach of, constitute a default (with or without

other authorization of, or filing with or notification to, any Person under
any Material Contract or Real Property Lease, other than in the case of
clauses (c) and (d) of this Section 4.7 (other than any Material Contract
relating to the Indebtedness of any of the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company, the Chehalis Joint Venture or any other Company Financing Party),
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied, (iii) cause either of the
Financing Commitments to be ineffective or

 



44  (iv) otherwise result in the Financing not being available on a timely basis
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of
the date hereof, neither the Sponsors nor any Forward Purchaser has notified
Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate either of the Financing
Commitments or not to provide the Financing.

(d) The net proceeds from the Equity Financing will be sufficient to
consummate the Tender Offer, Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the payment by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger
Consideration, the Offer Price and any fees and expenses of or payable by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation.

(e) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete (aside from
redactions) copy of the fee letters with respect to fees, market flex and
related arrangements with respect to the Forward Purchase Commitment (the "
_Fee Letters_ "), with only fee amounts and certain economic terms (none of
which would adversely affect the amount (other than in respect of upfront
fees) or availability of the Forward Purchase Commitment if so exercised by
the Forward Purchasers party thereto) redacted. Other than as set forth in the
unredacted portions of the Fee Letters, the Fee Letters do not contain any
conditions precedent to the funding of the Forward Purchase Commitment. As of
the date hereof, there are no side letters, understandings or other
agreements or arrangements relating to the funding of the full amount or any
portion of the Financing to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates are a party, other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitments delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. Other
than as set forth in the Financing Commitments and the unredacted portions of
the Fee Letters, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Equity Financing or
completion of the Forward Purchase Commitment (the " _Disclosed Conditions_
"). No Person has any right to impose, and none of the Sponsors, any Forward
Purchaser, Parent or Merger Sub has any obligation to accept, any condition
precedent to such funding other than the Disclosed Conditions nor any
reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Financing Commitments on
the Closing Date (nor any term or condition which would have the effect of
reducing the aggregate amount available under the Financing Commitments on the
Closing Date). Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in Article IV and the compliance by the Company with its obligations
under this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, or that the Financing will not
be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date. Parent or Merger Sub
has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments that are due as of the
date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing
under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger, for Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or any alternative financing.

 

Section 5.7 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Legal
Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or
any of

 



45  its Affiliates before any Governmental Authority that would or seeks to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates is subject to any Order of, or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority,
or any Order of any Governmental Authority that would or seeks to materially
delay or prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 5.8  _No Regulatory Impediment_. Parent is not aware of any material
fact relating to its or any of its Affiliates respective businesses,
operations, financial condition or legal status, including any officers,
directors or current employees status, that would reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of the parties to this Agreement to obtain, on a
timely basis, any authorization, consent, Order, declaration or approval of
any Governmental Authority or third party necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.9 _Absence of Arrangements with Management_. Other than this
Agreement, as of the date hereof there are no contracts, undertakings,
commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings between Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
member of the Companys management or the Company Board or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company after
the Effective Time.

Section 5.10 _Brokers_. The Company will not be responsible for any brokerage,
finders or other fee or commission to any broker, finder or investment
banker in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based on arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, other than
any such fee that is conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.

Section 5.11 _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company a limited
guarantee of the Sponsors in favor of the Company, dated the date hereof (as
amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with its
terms, the " _Limited Guarantee_ "). The Limited Guarantee is in full force
and effect and, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Sponsors, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, and has not been amended, withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default on the part of the Sponsors under the Limited
Guarantee.

 

Section 5.12 _Independent Investigation_. In entering into this Agreement and
each of the other documents and instruments relating to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have
each relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis and the
representations and warranties provided by the Company in Article IV, and
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that (a) except for the specific
representations and warranties of the Company

 



46  contained in this Agreement (including any that are subject to the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Company SEC Reports), none of the Company, its
Affiliates or any of its or their respective stockholders, controlling
persons or Representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty,
either express or implied, with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or the Chehalis Joint Venture or their business, operations,
technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition,
prospects, projections, budgets, estimates or operational metrics, or as to
the accuracy or completeness of any of the information (including any
statement, document or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any
financial statements and any projections, estimates or other forward-looking
information) provided (including in any management presentations, information
or descriptive memorandum, certain "data rooms" maintained by the Company,
supplemental information or other materials or information with respect to any
of the above) or otherwise made available to Parent and Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives and (b) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Company, its
Affiliates or any of its or their respective stockholders, controlling persons
or Representatives shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to
Parent or Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates, stockholders or
Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, at law or in
equity, under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon
any information provided or made available, or statements made (or any
omissions therefrom), to Parent or Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates,
stockholders or Representatives, except as and only to the extent expressly
set forth in this Agreement or due to Fraud. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that it has been furnished with, or given adequate
access to, all information and materials relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Chehalis Joint Venture that it has requested and
Representatives of the Company have answered all inquiries that Parent or
Merger Sub has made of them concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries.

none of the Company, its Affiliates, its Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives shall have breached in any material respect any of the
provisions set forth in Section 6.5 or in Section 6.7, (B) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after having consulted with the Companys outside

duties, and (C) the Company provides Parent with written notice of the
Companys intent to take such action at least three Business Days before
taking such action; or (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction orders the
Company to take such action or issues an injunction mandating such action.

(a) Except as permitted by Section 6.5(b), the Company shall not, and the
Company shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and the Company shall not permit
its or its Subsidiaries Representatives to directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing

any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding or furnish any non-public information in
connection with, a Takeover Proposal (other than to state that the Company is
not permitted to have discussions) or (iii) execute or enter into any

Agreement).

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(a), until the Acceptance Time, following the

clarify the terms of such Takeover Proposal and (ii) if the Company Board
determines in good faith (A) that such unsolicited bona fide written Takeover
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the

respect to such unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, then the Company may, in response to
such Takeover Proposal, (x) furnish access and non-public information
with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who has
made such unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so long as any written material non-
public information provided under this clause (x) has previously been
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent substantially concurrently with
the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions and
negotiations regarding such unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal.
The Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary shall terminate, waive,
amend, modify or fail to enforce any existing standstill or confidentiality
obligations owed by any Person to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
each case except (I) to the extent necessary to permit the Company to take an
action it is otherwise permitted to take under

 



54  Section 6.5(b)(ii) in full compliance with such provision or (II) to the
extent that the Company has duly effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with the terms hereof with respect to a proposal by the third
party subject to such standstill provision. The Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties that
may be ongoing with respect to any Takeover Proposal as of the date hereof,

such third parties be returned or destroyed promptly.

 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall advise Parent
orally and in writing of (i) the receipt by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives, of any bona
fide inquiries, proposals or offers, requests for information or requests for
discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the party making the
Takeover Proposal, and (ii) any material modifications to the financial or
other material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, in each case
as promptly as practical (and in any event within two days) of the Companys
receipt thereof. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent and shall otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status of any discussions or negotiations and of any modifications to such
inquiries, proposals or offers, including any change in the Companys
intentions as previously stated.

Agreement), (iv) enter into any agreement, letter of intent, or agreement in
principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder, (v)
subject to Section 6.5(g), fail to recommend against any Takeover Proposal
subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten Business
Days after the commencement of such Takeover Proposal, (vi) fail to include
the Company Board Recommendation in either the Schedule 14D-9 or Company Proxy
Statement or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (each such
action set forth in this Section 6.5(d), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
").

(e) Notwithstanding Section 6.5(d), the Company Board may, at any time before
the Acceptance Time and in response to a Superior Proposal received by the
Company Board after the date of this Agreement, (x) make an Adverse

 



55  Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.5(f) or (y) terminate
this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to a Superior Proposal to the extent set forth in Section 8.4(a), but only
if:

(i) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent in
advance of taking such action that it is prepared (x) to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change which notice shall specify the details of the
Intervening Event or (y) to terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, which
notice shall include the material terms and conditions of the transaction that
constitutes such Superior Proposal and the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal, and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of all of
the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such
Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the then-current
form of the definitive agreements with respect to such Superior Proposal;

(ii) prior to making any Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, approving or recommending such Superior Proposal or
terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent and its Affiliates in good faith (to the extent Parent and its
Affiliates also seek to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that this Agreement results in a transaction
that is no less favorable to the stockholders of the Company than any Takeover
Proposal that is deemed to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(iii) Parent does not make, within three Business Days after the receipt of
such notice (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the
financial or other terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal shall
require an additional notice to Parent and an additional two Business Day
period) (any such notice period being the " _Notice Period_ "), a binding and
irrevocable written and complete proposal (including any schedules or
exhibits) that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor, causes the Takeover Proposal that constituted a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause (e), and any purported termination pursuant to the
foregoing clause (e) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless (A) at
or concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Company
Termination Fee in full and otherwise complies with the provisions of Section
8.6(b) and (B) such Superior Proposal did not result from a breach by the
Company of this Section 6.5.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
Section 6.5(e), at any time before the Acceptance Time (i) in response to the
receipt of a bona fide written Takeover Proposal if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its advisors) that such bona
fide written 

 



56  Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and following consultation
with outside legal counsel, that it is required to withdraw, modify or amend
the Company Board Recommendation in order to comply with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, or (ii) if other than
in connection with a Takeover Proposal, an event, fact, circumstance,
development or occurrence (an " _Intervening Event_ ") that affects the
business assets or operations of the Company that is unknown to the Company
Board as of the date of this Agreement becomes known to the Company Board
prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and the Company Board has
concluded in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that it would be required to withdraw, modify or amend the Company
Board Recommendation in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then, in each case, the
Company Board may withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent; _provided_ , that the Company Board may not
withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing if any such Superior Proposal
resulted from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.5. The Company agrees
that any violation of this Section 6.5 by any Subsidiary or Representative of
the Company shall be deemed a breach of this Section 6.5 by the Company.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any
required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law or such disclosure is
otherwise required under applicable Law.

Section 6.6 _Company Proxy Statement_.

(a) If approval of, or notification to, the Companys stockholders is
required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger, then promptly following
the later of (i) the Acceptance Time, and (ii) the expiration of any
Subsequent Offering Period, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare and file with the SEC not later than five Business Days
following such date the preliminary Company Proxy Statement. Parent shall
provide the Company with any information that may be required in connection
with the preparation and filing of the Company Proxy Statement and any updates
to such information, as appropriate. The Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such draft, and once such
draft is in a form reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the Company,
the Company shall file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC in accordance
with this Section 6.6(a).

 

(b) The Company agrees that none of the information included or incorporated
by reference in the Company Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first

 



57  mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading; _provided_ , that no representation or warranty is made by
the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein to the extent based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
preparation of the Company Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant and agree that none of the
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any Affiliate
of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Company Proxy Statement shall, at the date it is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting
or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;
_provided_ , that no representation or warranty is made by either Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein to the extent based on information supplied by the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company in connection with the preparation of the Company
Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

(d) The Company shall (i) respond to any comments on the Company Proxy
Statement or requests for additional information from the SEC as soon as
practicable after receipt of any such comments or requests and (ii) cause the
definitive Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the
Company as promptly as practicable following the filing of the preliminary
Company Proxy Statement with the SEC in accordance with Section 6.6(a). The
Company shall promptly (A) notify Parent upon the receipt of any such comments
or requests and (B) provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its
staff, on the other hand. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Company Proxy Statement, so that the Company Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
Before responding to any such comments or requests or the filing or mailing of
the definitive Company Proxy Statement, the Company (x) shall provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of
the Company Proxy Statement and related correspondence and filings and (y)
shall include in such drafts, correspondence and filings all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.

 



58 (e) Notwithstanding Section 6.6(a) and Section 6.7, if following the
Acceptance Time or the exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent, Merger Sub or
any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall collectively hold at
least 90% of the total shares of Common Stock then outstanding (determined on
a fully-diluted basis), then each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after the consummation of the purchase of the
shares of Common Stock in the Tender Offer without a meeting of stockholders
of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

(f) The Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board
Recommendation unless the Company Board has withdrawn, modified or amended the
Company Board Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.5.

 

Section 6.7 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. Following the clearance of the
Company Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company shall call, give notice of
and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company
Vote, if approval of the Companys stockholders is required by applicable Law
to consummate the Merger. Subject to Section 6.6, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, and to cause its Representatives to, solicit or
cause to be solicited from its stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of
this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company may postpone, recess or adjourn
the Company Stockholders Meeting: (a) with the consent of Parent, (b) for the
absence of a quorum, or (c) to allow reasonable additional time for
the filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure which
the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) is necessary or advisable under applicable Laws and for
such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by
the Companys stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. At the
Company Stockholders Meeting, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause all shares of
Common Stock then owned by them and their Subsidiaries to be voted in favor
of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 6.8 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

(a) For the period commencing as of the Acceptance Time and ending on the one
year anniversary of the Acceptance Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "), the
Company (and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) or any
of its Subsidiaries shall provide to each individual who, immediately prior
to the Acceptance Time is an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including any individual on short-term disability leave
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (each, an " _Employee_ ")
compensation and benefits (excluding equity and equity-based awards which will
remain discretionary) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to the Employees under the compensation and benefit plans, programs,
policies,

 



59  agreements and arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, after the Acceptance Time, nothing herein shall
preclude the Company (and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) from terminating the employment of any Employee for any lawful
reason.

 

(b) From and after the Acceptance Time, the Company (and, following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall, or shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, honor all Company Benefit Plans (including all severance,
change of control and similar plans and agreements) in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, subject to any
amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such Company
Benefit Plans and except as provided herein; _provided_ , that nothing herein
shall prevent the amendment or termination of any specific plan, program
policy, agreement or arrangement, or interfere with Parents, the Companys,
the Surviving Corporations or any of their respective Affiliates rights or
obligations to make such changes as are necessary to comply with applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the later of the duration of the
Continuation Period or the remaining term of any individual employment,
severance or separation agreement in effect immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company (and, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) shall provide each Employee who suffers a termination
of employment under circumstances that would have given the Employee a right
to severance payments and benefits under the Companys severance policy
or individual employment, severance or separation agreement or other
arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and as set
forth in Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a " _Company
Severance Plan_ ") with severance payments and benefits no less favorable
than those that would have been provided to such Employee under any Company
Severance Plan.

(c) For all purposes under all employee benefit plans of the Company (and,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) and its Subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Employee after the Acceptance Time (the " _New
Plans_ "), each Employee shall receive full credit for such Employees years
of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Acceptance Time
(including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which
the Company and its Subsidiaries have given credit for prior service), to the
same extent as such Employee was entitled, prior to the Acceptance Time, to
credit for such service under any similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan
(except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of accrual of
benefits). In addition, where applicable, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing: (i) at the Acceptance Time, each Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in each New
Plan to the extent such waiting time was satisfied under a similar or
comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Employee participated
immediately before the Acceptance Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ "), (ii) the Company (and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations
and actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan to be waived or satisfied
for such Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or
satisfied

 



60  under the analogous Old Plan as of the Acceptance Time and (iii) the Company
(and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall cause all
eligible expenses incurred by each Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(d) To the extent required by Law or under any Company Benefit Plan as of
December 17, 2011, with respect to any earned but unused vacation time to
which any Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy or individual
agreement or other arrangement applicable to such Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the Company (and, following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation) or any of its Subsidiaries shall, (i) allow such
Employee to use such earned vacation and (ii) if any Employees employment
terminates during the Continuation Period under circumstances entitling the
Employee to severance pay under the Company Severance Plan, pay the Employee,
in cash, an amount equal to the value of the earned vacation time.

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.8, whether express or implied, shall confer upon
any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, any entitlement, rights or
remedies (including, without limitation, any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period), of any nature or kind whatsoever under
or by reason of this Section 6.8. No provision of this Section 6.8 is
intended to modify, amend or create any employee benefit plan of the Company,
Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates.

Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of any present
or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and the fiduciaries of any Company Benefit Plans (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in (i) the Company Organizational
Documents, (ii) the minutes of any meetings of the Company Board or
any committee of the Company Board set forth in Section 6.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, (iii) the minutes of any meetings of the boards of
directors, or any committee of the boards of directors or equivalent governing
bodies, of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company set forth in Section 6.9(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, (iv) agreements between an Indemnified Party
and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or (v) otherwise in effect at the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _Covered Indemnification Rights_ "), to
survive the Tender Offer and the Merger and to continue in full force and
effect without any modification that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of such Indemnified Parties for a period of not less than six
years after the Effective Time or, if longer, for such period as is set forth
in any applicable agreement with an Indemnified Party in effect on the date of
this Agreement.

 



61 (b) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify all
Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with
respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their services
as directors, officers or employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
another Person, if such Indemnified Party is or was serving as a director,
officer or employee of such other Person at the request of the Company, or
fiduciaries of the Company Benefit Plans, whether asserted or claimed at or
after or occurring before the Effective Time (including in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise) to the same extent
as provided in the Covered Indemnification Rights, in effect on the date of
this Agreement. If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any Legal
Action in connection with any matter subject to indemnification hereunder,
then the Surviving Corporation shall advance as incurred any costs or expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and disbursements of counsel selected by the
Indemnified Party), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities
(" _Damages_ ") arising out of or incurred in connection with such Legal
Action, subject to the Surviving Corporations receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Damages if it is
ultimately determined under applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified. In the event of any such Legal Action, (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such Legal Action and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Legal
Action pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Party is a
party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Legal Action or the Indemnified Party otherwise
consents.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for at least six years
after the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company or policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) so long as Parent and the
Surviving Corporation are not required to pay a premium in excess of 300 % of
the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance before the
date of this Agreement (such 300% amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If
the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance described in the
prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium, then
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, instead
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the
arrangements contemplated by this Section 6.9(c), before the Effective Time,
the Company shall be entitled to purchase a

 



62  "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the
matters described in this Section 6.9(c) and, if the Company elects to
purchase such a policy before the Effective Time, then Parent and the
Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section 6.9(c) shall be
satisfied so long as Parent and the Surviving Corporation cause such policy to
be maintained in effect for a period of six years following the Effective
Time.

(d) The Surviving Corporation hereby acknowledges that the Indemnified Parties
may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or
insurance provided by other Persons. The Surviving Corporation hereby agrees
that (i) except with respect to indemnification provided under any insurance
policy obtained by or on behalf of the Company from an insurance company,
surety or similar provider (a " _Company Insurer_ "), the Surviving
Corporation is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the
Indemnified Parties are primary and any obligation of such other Persons
(other than Company Insurers) to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by any such
Indemnified Party are secondary), (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by any such
Indemnified Party and shall be liable for the full indemnifiable amounts,
without regard to any rights any such Indemnified Party may have against any
such other Person (other than a Company Insurer) and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases such other Persons
(other than Company Insurers) from any and all claims against any such other
Persons for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in
respect thereof. The Surviving Corporation further agrees that no advancement
or payment by any of such other Persons on behalf of any such Indemnified
Party with respect to any claim for which such Indemnified Party has sought
indemnification from the Surviving Corporation shall affect the foregoing and
such other Persons (other than Company Insurers) shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement
or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Indemnified Party against
the Surviving Corporation.

(e) The covenants contained in this Section 6.9 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action so that the successors
or assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.

 



63 Section 6.10 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable
Law, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.11, each of the parties to this
Agreement shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the Tender
Offer Conditions and the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII are
satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be
obligated by this Section 6.10 to waive any Tender Offer Condition or
condition to the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms of this
Section 6.10 shall not limit the rights of the Company set forth in Section
6.5.

Section 6.11 _Consents; Filings; Further Action; Stockholder Actions_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law and subject to this Section 6.11 each of
Parent and the Company shall, and Parent shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, use its reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) obtain any consents,
approvals or other authorizations, and make any filings and notifications,
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) make any other submissions either required or deemed appropriate by
either Parent or the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
the DGCL, the Applicable Exchange rules and regulations and any other
applicable Law, including, if the Expiration Date occurs on or after May 11,
2012, filing the Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period
ending March 31, 2012 pursuant to the Exchange Act no later than May 11, 2012,
and (iii) take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or
advisable consistent with this Section 6.11 to cause the expiration of the
applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required consents, approvals or
authorizations, as applicable, under such Laws as soon as practicable. As
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Company
shall deliver all notices required pursuant to any Material Contracts or Real
Property Leases as a result of the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and/or and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, waive any notice periods required pursuant to any
intercompany agreements as a result of the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and/or and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would, without such waiver,
extend beyond the Initial Expiration Date. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all
such filings and notifications, including by providing copies of all relevant
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors before filing. Parent shall
not consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting
period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority
without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



64 (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent or the Company (or
any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional
information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, to the extent practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such request.
No party shall participate in any meeting or engage in any material
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority without giving the
other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited
by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate.
Parent shall advise the Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings
or agreements (oral or written) which Parent proposes to make or enter into
with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Law as
promptly as practicable.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to
Section 6.14 and Section 6.16, in connection with obtaining any approval,
consent or waiver from any Person with respect to the Tender Offer or the
Merger, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval, consent or waiver is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation
due to such Person, in each case other than immaterial amounts or commitments,
and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose approval, consent or waiver is being solicited
any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation other than immaterial amounts, commitments or obligations.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
without limiting Parents obligations with respect to the Forward Purchase
Commitment as set out in Section 6.14, nothing shall obligate Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to take any action or agree to take
or not take any action that would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as
would or would reasonably be expected to cause a Company Material Adverse
Effect, Parent shall take, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to take (and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
Section 6.1 and Section 6.5, the Company and its Affiliates shall be
permitted to take, without affecting any representation, warranty, covenant or
condition in this Agreement), all action necessary to avoid the entry or to
effect the dissolution of, or vacate or lift, any Order which would otherwise
have the effect of preventing, impairing or delaying the Closing.

 



65 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates shall be required to (and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall), (i) sell, license,
divest or dispose of or hold separate any entities, assets, Intellectual
Property or businesses of any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
terminate, amend or assign existing relationships or contractual rights and
obligations, of any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) change or
modify any course of conduct regarding future operations, of any Affiliate of
Parent or Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) otherwise take actions that would limit its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
their respective businesses, assets or rights or interests therein or (v)
commit to take any such actions in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or
(iv). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required
to, take any action with respect to any Order or any applicable Law which
would bind the Company or its Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the Merger
occurs.

(g) The Company shall promptly (i) provide copies to Parent of all proceedings
and correspondence relating to any Legal Actions or claims pending or
threatened in writing against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors or officers by any stockholder of the Company and
(ii) shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a timely basis regarding any
oral claims made or threatened against any such Person as to which the
directors or officers of the Company are aware, in each case, relating to the
Tender Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the " _Transaction Claims_ "), shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate with the Company regarding the defense or
settlement of any such Transaction Claim, and shall give due consideration to
Parents advice with respect to such stockholder Legal Action. The Company
shall not settle any Transaction Claims unless the settlement contains a full
and unconditional release of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Affiliates and the Representatives of each of the
foregoing in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (which such
satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

Section 6.12 _Public Announcements_. Except as provided for in this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except to the extent required by applicable Law or
the Applicable Exchange requirements, in which case that party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing
any such release or making any such public statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, without the prior consent of the other parties, the Company (a) may
communicate with customers, vendors, suppliers, financial analysts, investors
and media representatives in a manner consistent with its past practice
regarding matters unrelated to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in compliance with applicable Law and (b) may disseminate
the information included in a press release or other document previously
approved for external distribution by Parent.

 



66 Section 6.13 _Fees, Expenses and Conveyance Taxes_. Except as explicitly
provided otherwise in this Agreement, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all expenses (including those payable to Representatives)
incurred by any party to this Agreement or on its behalf in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Expenses_ ") shall be paid by the party incurring those Expenses. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event will Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates (other than the Company, the Surviving Corporation and any of
their respective Subsidiaries) be responsible for any of the fees or expenses
of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP or any of the Companys other
Representatives, in each case, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any sales, transfer,
stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or gains and
any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Tender
Offer has been consummated, the Company shall reimburse Parent and Merger Sub
for all of their out-of-pocket expenses at the Acceptance Time.

 

Section 6.14 _Financing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Equity Financing and, if the Requisite
Notes Consent is not obtained, to consummate the "Change of Control Offer"
contemplated by the Forward Purchase Commitment as soon as reasonably
practicable on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments (and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
2017 First Mortgage Indenture), including the market flex terms in the related
Fee Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with
its obligations under the Financing Commitments, (ii) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Forward Purchase Commitment on
terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those
contained in the Forward Purchase Commitment Letter, including the market
flex provisions in the related Fee Letter (or on terms which would not
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the consummation of the Tender
Offer) and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub contained in the Financing Commitments (or any
definitive agreements related thereto) that are within its reasonable control,
including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required
as a condition to the Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the immediately preceding sentence, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (and in the case of the Forward Purchase Commitment only,
unless the Requisite Notes Consent is obtained), each of Parent and Merger
Sub shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable
best efforts to take all actions necessary to maintain in effect the Financing
Commitments in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof. Parent shall keep the

 



67  Company informed on a regular basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Financing (including providing the Company with
copies of draft and definitive agreements and other documents related to the
Financing). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (but in any event, within two
Business Days) (x) of any breach or default by any party to any of the
Financing Commitments, the Equity Commitment Letter or definitive agreements
related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, and (y)
of the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B) other communication, in each
case from any Financing source with respect to any (1) actual or potential
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the
Financing Commitments, the Equity Commitment Letter or definitive agreements
related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Commitments, the
Equity Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing or
(2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
of the Financing Commitments, the Equity Commitment Letter or definitive
agreements related to the Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within two Business Days of the date
the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the
immediately preceding sentence. Parent shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement or waive any of the
conditions or contingencies to funding or consummation, as applicable,
contained in the Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related
thereto) or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Financing
Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto), in each case, to
the extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of, or consummation of the Change of Control Offer
contemplated by, the Financing, as applicable, in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of (A) materially and adversely
affecting the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to (x) consummate the Tender
Offer or (y) timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) amending, modifying, supplementing or waiving the conditions
or contingencies to the Financing in a manner that would make the funding of,
or consummation of the Change of Control Offer contemplated by,
the Financing, as applicable, or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
or consummating the Financing, as applicable, materially less likely to occur.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent shall have the right to substitute other debt or equity for all or any
portion of the Forward Purchase Commitment contemplated by the Forward
Purchase Commitment Letter from the same and/or alternative financing sources
and terminate the Forward Purchase Commitment Letter if the terms would not be
reasonably expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
Tender Offer. The Parent shall notify the Company as promptly as practicable
in advance of such substitution.

(c) In the event all conditions applicable to the Financing Commitments have
been satisfied and all Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied or

 



68  waived, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of the
Sponsors to fund the Equity Financing and the Parent or its Affiliates to
consummate the Change of Control Offer contemplated by the Forward Purchase
Commitment to the extent required to consummate the Tender Offer. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is expressly understood that the Forward Purchase
Commitment shall not be deemed required to consummate the Tender Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any reference
in this Agreement to (A) "Financing," and " _Forward Purchase Commitment_ "
shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended
or modified in compliance with this Section 6.14 and (B) " _Financing
Commitments_ ", " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ", " _Forward Purchasers_ " and "
_Forward Purchase Commitment Letter_ " shall include such documents or
parties as amended, modified, substituted or replaced in compliance with this
Section 6.14.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to cooperate
reasonably with and assist Parent, Merger Sub and their authorized
Representatives in connection with the arrangement of the Financing on the
terms contemplated by the Forward Purchase Commitment and, upon
Parents request in connection with the arrangement of a working capital
credit facility (the " _Working Capital Facility_ "), including (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions, road shows and sessions with ratings agencies on
reasonable advance notice, (ii) furnishing the Required Information as
promptly as reasonably practicable, (iii) assisting in a reasonable manner
with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering
documents, private placement memoranda, information memoranda and packages (to
the extent relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries) and similar documents
for the Forward Purchase Commitment and the Working Capital Facility and
executing customary authorization and management representation letters
(including, in the case of a public-side version of an information memorandum,
a representation to the arranger of the Working Capital Facility that such
public-side version does not include material non-public information about the
Company and its Subsidiaries), in each case, to the extent reasonably
necessary for the consummation of the Forward Purchase Commitment or the
Working Capital Facility, (iv) taking all corporate actions, subject to the
consummation of the Tender Offer, reasonably requested by Parent that are
reasonably necessary or customary to permit the consummation of the Forward
Purchase Commitment and the Working Capital Facility, (v) cooperating
reasonably in respect of the preparation of and, if applicable, executing and
delivering any underwriting or placement agreements, pledge and security
documents, hedging agreements and other definitive financing documents
related to the Financing on the terms contemplated by the Financing
Commitments and the Working Capital Facility, (vi) permitting Parent and
Merger Sub to access and use the cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries to
pay the Merger Consideration and/or to pay the related fees and expenses of
Parent, Merger Sub and/or the Company; _provided_ , that such cash is not
restricted from being used for such purpose pursuant to the terms of the
Contracts governing the Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(vii) using its reasonable best efforts to obtain, in each case, to the extent
reasonably necessary for the consummation of the

 



69  Forward Purchase Commitment or the Working Capital Facility, customary
accountants comfort letters, consents, surveys and, appraisals, engineering
reports, environmental and other inspections, title insurance and other
documentation and items relating to the Forward Purchase Commitment, the
Working Capital Facility and collateral arrangements, as reasonably requested
by Parent, (viii) executing and delivering any customary and reasonable
officers certificates, customary closing documents, or other certificates or
documents with respect to the Forward Purchase Commitment contemplated by the
Forward Purchase Commitment Letter and the Working Capital Facility, in each
case, as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including customary consents
of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the
Forward Purchase Commitment), in each case, to the extent reasonably
necessary for the consummation of the Forward Purchase Commitment or the
Working Capital Facility, (ix) using reasonable best efforts to facilitate the
pledging of collateral for the Working Capital Facility, including taking
commercially reasonable actions necessary to permit the sources of the
Working Capital Facility to evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries real
property and current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies
and procedures for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements in
connection with the Working Capital Facility, and (x) assisting Parent in
obtaining ratings in connection with the Forward Purchase Commitment and/or
the Working Capital Facility; _provided_ , that (A) the Company shall not be
required to make any payments under any such agreements or documents prior to
the Acceptance Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement by or on
behalf of Parent or become subject to any obligations or liabilities with
respect thereto that are not covered by the indemnity in clause (e) below, (B)
the Company shall only be obligated to provide a solvency certificate in a
customary form at or following the Acceptance Time in connection with the
closing of the Working Capital Facility and (C) nothing shall obligate the
Company to provide any information that would violate any obligations of
confidentiality to any third party or result in a violation of Law or loss of
any attorney-client privilege.

(e) The Company and its Representatives shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any financing documents and any
materials that are to be presented during any meetings conducted in connection
with the Financing and/or the Working Capital Facility, and Parent shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its Representatives. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the Company and its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability
to any Person under or in connection with, the arrangement of the Financing or
any alternative financing that Parent or Merger Sub may raise in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than with respect
to the Excluded Obligations. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and
several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all Damages suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or
any alternative financing and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than the Excluded Obligations). The foregoing indemnity will expire and
terminate automatically without any further liability

 



70  effective as of the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes
of the foregoing, Damages will include any indemnification obligations of the
Company to its Affiliates and the Companys or any of such Affiliates
Representatives. For purposes of the foregoing, "Excluded Obligations" means
(i) liabilities resulting from or arising out of information provided by or on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Chehalis Joint Venture, (ii)
Damages proximately resulting from or arising out of a breach by the Company
of a representation and warranty or covenant and (iii) fees or expenses
covered by Section 6.13.

 

(f) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in connection with the
Forward Purchase Commitment and Working Capital Facility;  _provided_ that
such logos are used solely in a manner that would not reasonably be expected
to harm the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(g) The Company shall periodically update the Required Information provided to
Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement as may be necessary such that
the Required Information does not contain any untrue statement of material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained therein not misleading.

(h) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
New Grand Mound Loans as soon as reasonably practicable on terms no less
favorable to the Company in any material respect than those terms set forth
on the Grand Mound Term Sheet and on such other terms no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company in any material respect than those terms contained in
the Grand Mound Loans. The Company shall keep Parent and Merger
Sub reasonably apprised of developments relating to the New Grand Mound Loans
and shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any material change with
respect thereto. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any financing documents negotiated in
connection with the New Grand Mound Loans, and the Company shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives.

(i) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to reasonably assist Parent, Merger Sub and their
authorized Representatives in connection with the preparation of any
deliverables required by the terms of any Indebtedness evidenced by
agreements set forth in Section 4.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
including, without limitation, (i) obtaining any officers certificates, or
documents reasonably requested by Parent, Merger Sub and their
authorized Representatives to facilitate the execution and delivery of such
deliverables, and (ii) facilitating the communication with any third parties,
including to determine whether such deliverables are required; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this Section 6.14(i) shall be construed to require any
Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries, respectively, to prepare or
execute any legal opinions or memoranda other than as set forth in the next
sentence. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all

 



71  necessary actions required pursuant to Section 8.01 of the New Junior
Subordinated Notes Indenture and Section 8.01 of the Indenture, dated as of

following, and only in the event of, the Acceptance Time.

Section 6.15 _Section 16b-3_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall (and shall be permitted to) take such steps as may be reasonably
required to cause dispositions of the Companys equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with
that certain No-Action letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC
regarding such matters.

Section 6.16 _Mortgage Notes Consent Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to commence or cause
the Issuers to commence (or, at Parents election in its sole discretion, to
assist Parent or its Affiliates or its Representatives in a third party
commencement of) a consent solicitation on the date hereof, and in any event
shall commence such consent solicitation no later than the date the Tender
Offer is required to be commenced pursuant to Section 1.1(a) (the " _Consent
Solicitation_ "); and (ii) reasonably assist Parent or its Affiliates or its
Representatives in a third party commencement of an offer to purchase and/or
a change of control offer (a " _Change of Control Offer_ ") (which Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to commence on the date hereof and in no
event later than the date the Tender Offer is required to be commenced
pursuant to Section 1.1(a)), in each case, in respect of the 2017 First
Mortgage Notes issued pursuant to the 2017 First Mortgage Indenture, on such
terms and conditions requested by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (it being understood that the amendments described in _Exhibit E_
hereto are acceptable for such consent solicitation). Such amendments shall
include amendments to waive the requirement to make a Change of Control Offer
(the " _Change of Control Amendments_ ") and to modify such other terms and
provisions of the 2017 First Mortgage Indenture requested by the Parent and in
any event so as to accommodate Parents financing with respect to the
transactions provided for herein (such actions are referred to collectively
as the " _Notes Offers_ ") with respect to the 2017 First Mortgage Notes
issued by GWR Operating Partnership, L.L.L.P. and Great Wolf Finance Corp.
(the " _Issuers_ "), pursuant to that certain Indenture, dated as of April 7,
2010, by and among the Company, the Issuers, the guarantors named therein, and
U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the " _2017 First Mortgage
Indenture_ "). The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Notes Offers. Such cooperation shall include (i) engagement of a
solicitation 

 



72  agent, information agent, dealer manager and a depositary agent with respect
thereto, in each case, reasonably acceptable to Parent and on terms and
conditions reasonably acceptable to Parent, (ii) the delivery by the Company
and the Issuers of Officers Certificates and Opinions of Counsel (as such
terms are defined in the 2017 First Mortgage Indenture) required under the
2017 First Mortgage Indenture, (iii) execution and delivery of supplemental
indentures and (iv) using commercially reasonably efforts to cause the trustee
under the 2017 First Mortgage Indenture to execute supplemental indentures, in
the case of subclauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), upon the receipt of the
Requisite Notes Consent and/or requisite noteholder approval of any of the
amendments proposed in _Exhibit E_ ; _provided_ that, in each case, the
Company and its Affiliates shall not be required to make any payments
under any of the foregoing prior to the consummation of the Tender Offer.

(b) The Companys or the Issuers obligations to make any payment with
respect to the Notes Offers shall be subject to conditions as requested by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company, including that (i) the
consummation of the Tender Offer shall occur concurrently therewith (or
Parent and the Company shall be satisfied that it will occur substantially
concurrently with obtaining such consent and making such payment (if any)) and
(ii) such other conditions as are customary for transactions similar to
the Notes Offers. The minimum consent fee offered by the Company to any
holder of 2017 First Mortgage Notes issued pursuant to the 2017 First Mortgage
Indenture willing to give its consent to the Change of Control Amendments
contained in the Consent Solicitation, shall be the amount set forth in
_Exhibit E_ , subject to the terms and conditions contained in the documents
pursuant to which such Consent Solicitation is made. The parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to complete the Notes Offers prior to or concurrently
with the Acceptance Time (including by making public announcements extending
the expiration date of the Notes Offers as requested by the Parent and by the
Company otherwise complying with the time periods required by Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, if applicable); _provided_ that the parties
obligations to complete the Change Control Offer shall terminate upon receipt
of the Requisite Notes Consent and the effectiveness of the
supplemental indenture giving effect to the waiver of the "Change of Control
Offer" under the 2017 First Mortgage Notes Indenture. Unless otherwise agreed
by Parent, concurrent with the Acceptance Time, and in accordance with the
terms of the Notes Offers, the Company or the Issuers, if they have made a
consent solicitation, shall pay any consent payments in connection with any
consents properly given and not withdrawn in such consent solicitation;
_provided_ that, the Company, and the Issuers shall not be obligated to pay
any consent payments in connection with such consent solicitation unless the
Tender Offer has been consummated. To the extent necessary, Parent shall
provide (or cause to be provided) sufficient immediately available funds to
the Company to make all payments required by the preceding sentence at or
prior to the time such payments are to be made. The Notes Offers and other
actions taken in connection therewith shall be conducted in accordance with
the terms of the 2017 First Mortgage Indenture and all applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC and other applicable Laws.

 



73 (c) The Company shall, and shall cause the Issuers to, waive any of the
conditions to the Notes Offers as may be reasonably requested by Parent
(other than the conditions that the payment of the consent fee or the Change
of Control Offer are conditioned on the consummation of the Tender Offer as
provided in clause (b) above and that there shall be no Law prohibiting
consummation of the Notes Offers), so long as such waivers would not cause the
Notes Offers to violate the 2017 First Mortgage Indenture, the Exchange Act,
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or any other applicable Law.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not, and shall
not permit the Issuers to, waive any condition to the Notes Offers or make any
change, amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of the
Notes Offers (including any extension thereof) other than as agreed between
Parent and the Company or as required to comply with applicable Law.

(d) Parent shall prepare, in consultation with the Company, as promptly as
practicable, a consent solicitation statement and/or an offer to purchase, as
applicable, in respect of the Notes Offers, together with any required
related consent letters and similar ancillary agreements (such documents,
together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to herein
collectively as the " _Notes Offer Documents_ "). Parent and the Company
shall, and the Company shall cause the Issuers to, reasonably cooperate with
each other in the preparation of the Notes Offer Documents. The Notes Offer
Documents shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, Parent
and the Company, and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them (it being
understood that the documents attached in _Exhibit E_ hereto are reasonably
acceptable to the Company).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , Parent shall promptly
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and
expenses (including legal fees and expenses, printing costs, and the out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses of any solicitation agent or other agent
retained in connection with the Notes Offer) incurred by or on behalf of the
Company or any of the Issuers in connection with the Notes Offer. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act for any Damages incurred by any of
them in connection with any action taken by them to the extent pursuant to
this Section 6.16 with respect to the Notes Offer other than the Excluded
Obligations. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the respective officers,
directors and representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any
Damages incurred by any of them in connection with any action taken by them
to the extent pursuant to this Section 6.16 with respect to the Notes Offer
other than the Excluded Obligations; _provided_ that to the extent such
indemnitee is also the beneficiary of indemnification from the Company or
any Subsidiary or any insurance policy obtained by or on behalf of the
Company from a Company Insurer, Parent is the indemnitor of last resort.

(f) Except as otherwise specifically provided for in Section 6.16(a), any
legal opinions or negative assurance letters to be delivered in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.16 shall be delivered by
counsel to Parent, and the Company shall have no obligation with respect
thereto.

 



74 Section 6.17 _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall (i) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) take all steps to exclude the
applicability of any Takeover Laws to the Tender Offer, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement and (B) challenge the
validity or applicability of any Takeover Laws to the Tender Offer, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) not
take any action which reasonably could be expected to cause any Takeover Law
to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereby. No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the
approval of the Company Board for the purposes of causing any Takeover Law to
be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

Section 6.18 _Notice of Developments_. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence
or non-occurrence, to their respective knowledge, of any event, which is
likely (a) to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate if made as of the Expiration Date
or the Effective Time so that the Tender Offer Conditions or the conditions to
the Merger in Article VII, as applicable, would not be satisfied, (b) to
result in any material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied hereunder or
(c) to result in the failure of any condition to be satisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.18 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the
parties receiving such notice.

 

Section 6.19 _Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective as of the Acceptance Time,
of those directors of the Company or any Subsidiary designated by Parent to
the Company in writing at least 10 calendar days prior to the
Acceptance Time.

Section 6.20 _NASDAQ Delisting and Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Law and rules and policies of the Applicable Exchange to cause the
delisting of the Company and the Common Stock from the Applicable Exchange as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such
delisting.

Section 6.21 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time and to
the extent permitted by Law, the Company (acting through the Company Board,
compensation committee or the Independent Directors), to the extent required
will take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement,
arrangement or understanding as may be entered into by Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company on or after the date hereof with
any officer, director or employee that holds

 



75  shares of Common Stock pursuant to which compensation is paid to such
officer, director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to otherwise satisfy the requirements
of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the
Exchange Act.

written notice of such breach from Parent and the Termination Date, but only
so long as neither Parent nor Merger Sub are then in breach of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in

for Merger Sub to consummate the Tender Offer or the Merger; or

(d) if, as of any Expiration Date (A) Parent has not received the Requisite
Notes Consent, (B) the Forward Purchase Commitment Letter shall have been
terminated or the Forward Purchasers shall have indicated to Parent in writing

Tender Offer Condition; or

(c) if (i) all of the Tender Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or
waived as of the expiration of the Tender Offer (including any extensions
thereof in accordance with Section 1.1(b)), and Merger Sub shall have failed

intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to other

Section 9.15 _Rules of Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if

provision of this Agreement. Subject to and without limiting the introductory
language to Article IV and Article V, each party to this Agreement has or may
have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a section
of such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this Agreement
to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a
disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an admission by such
party that such item is material, that such item has had or would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case
may be, or that the disclosure of such be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

Section 9.16 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of
law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or liabilities under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and Merger Sub shall be
permitted, without the Companys consent, to assign any of their respective
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries or to any financing source for security purposes,
and the enforcement of all rights and remedies that Parent has against the
Company, but such assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any
obligation or liability hereunder. Any purported assignment without such prior
written consents shall be void.

 



96 Section 9.17 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Limited Guarantee were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy at
law or in equity, and the parties to this Agreement hereby waive any
requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection
therewith. The parties acknowledge and agree that each party hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior
to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance
to cause Parent and Merger Sub to draw down the Equity Financing pursuant to
the Equity Commitment Letter and to consummate the Tender Offer and the Merger
only if (a) with respect to the Tender Offer, all the Tender Offer Conditions
have been satisfied or waived as of the Expiration Date and either (i) the
Requisite Notes Consent has been obtained or (ii) (A) the Change of Control
Offer contemplated by the Forward Purchase Commitment has been completed or
will be completed substantially contemporaneously with the consummation of
the Tender Offer, (B) the Forward Purchase Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and (C) the Forward Purchasers have not indicated to Parent in
writing their intention not to consummate their obligations thereunder and
Parent or its Affiliate will be able to obtain the Forward Purchase Commitment
promptly following the Acceptance Time and, (b) with respect to the Merger,
(i) all the conditions in Article VII (other than those conditions that, by
their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied, (ii)
Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.2, and (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing is funded, the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to
enforce specifically Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded or to complete the Tender Offer and the Merger if (a) the Tender Offer
Conditions have not been satisfied or waived as of the Expiration Date or (b)
(i) the Requisite Notes Consent has not been obtained and (ii) (A) the Change
of Control Offer contemplated by the Forward Purchase Commitment has not been
completed or will not be completed contemporaneously with the consummation of
the Tender Offer or (B) the Forward Purchasers have indicated to Parent in
writing their intention not to consummate their obligations thereunder or
Parent or its Affiliate will not be able to obtain the Forward
Purchase Commitment promptly following the Acceptance Time. Each party hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (a) the other party
has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 



97 Section 9.18 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, as if the signatures to each counterpart were
upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed
an original of this Agreement. Facsimile signatures or signatures received as
