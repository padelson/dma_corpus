1 ##### Table of Contents

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties, intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I __

_THE OFFER_

1.1 The Offer. (a) (i) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with ARTICLE IX and that none of the events set
forth in Paragraph 2 of Exhibit B hereto shall exist or have occurred,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, promptly (but in no
event later than ten Business Days following the date of this Agreement)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) the Offer to purchase all
outstanding Shares, at the Offer Price. The obligations of Purchaser to, and
of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and to pay for any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to only those conditions set
forth in Exhibit B (the "Offer Conditions"). Purchaser expressly reserves the
right (but shall not be obligated) at any time or from time to time in its
sole discretion to waive any Offer Condition or modify or amend the terms of
the Offer, including an increase in the Offer Price, except that, without the
prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the
Offer Price or change the form of the consideration payable in the Offer, (B)
decrease the number of Shares sought pursuant to the Offer, (C) amend or
waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in Exhibit B), (D) add to the
conditions set forth on Exhibit B, (E) modify the conditions set forth on
Exhibit B in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (F) extend the
expiration of the Offer except as required or permitted by Section 1.1(a)(ii)
or (iii), or (G) make any other change in the terms or conditions of the Offer
which is adverse to the holders of Shares.

(ii) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth Business
Day following (and including the day of) the commencement of the Offer.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser may, without
the consent of the Company, (A) extend the Offer for one or more periods of
time of up to twenty Business Days per extension if at any scheduled
expiration of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions are not satisfied, until
such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived, (B) extend the
Offer for one or more periods of time of up to twenty Business Days per
extension, in order for Parent to secure or arrange for the availability of
the Financing, or any alternative financing that would allow Purchaser to
purchase and pay for the Shares pursuant to the Offer and pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, if, as of the date immediately preceding any
scheduled expiration of the Offer, the Financing, or any such alternative
financing as Parent may obtain, will not be available as of the scheduled
expiration of the Offer,  _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall not be
entitled to extend the Offer pursuant to this clause (B) beyond the Outside
Date, (C) elect to provide a subsequent offering period for the Offer in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act if at any scheduled
expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall not have accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer that number of Shares (not including any Shares tendered
pursuant to procedures for guaranteed delivery) which, together with the
number of Shares, if any, then owned beneficially by Parent, Purchaser or
their Subsidiaries, constitutes at least 90% of the total number of then-
outstanding Shares.

(iii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
(A) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") or the staff thereof or the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") applicable
to the Offer, (B) extend the Offer on one or more occasions for periods
determined by Purchaser of up to twenty Business Days per extension if, at any
scheduled expiration of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions have been
satisfied or waived other than the Offer Condition set forth in Paragraph
1(b) of Exhibit B; and (C) to the extent requested in writing by the Company
at least two Business Days prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer,
extend the Offer on one occasion (and, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
shall not be

 required to extend the Offer on more than one occasion pursuant to this
clause (C)), for a period determined by the Company of up to twenty Business
Days, if, at the then scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the Offer
Conditions, other than the Offer Condition set forth in Paragraph 1(b) of
Exhibit B, are not satisfied; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser shall not
be required to extend the Offer (1) pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C) beyond
the Outside Date or (2) at any time that it is permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE IX.

(iv) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the
satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser of the Offer Conditions as of the time of
any scheduled expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after
such scheduled expiration and Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, promptly accept and pay for all Shares as they are validly
tendered during any subsequent offer period. Parent shall provide or cause to
be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase
any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file
or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") with
respect to the Offer which shall contain the offer to purchase and related
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer
documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer
Documents"). The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to their filing
with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree (i) to provide the Company with, and
to consult with the Company regarding, any comments that may be received from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt thereof and prior to responding thereto and (ii) to provide the
Company with any comments or responses thereto. If at any time prior to the
Closing, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger, the Company,
Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set

regulation of any stock exchange.

1.3 Stockholder Lists. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
cause its transfer agent to, promptly (but in any event on or before July 16,
2008), furnish Parent and Purchaser with mailing labels, security position
listings and a listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of
the record holders of the Shares as of the latest practicable date and shall
furnish Parent and Purchaser with such information and assistance (including
periodic updates of such information) as Parent or Purchaser or their agents
may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and
beneficial holders of the Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, and except for such actions as are reasonably necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder,
Purchaser shall hold all information and documents provided to it under this
Section 1.3 in confidence in accordance with the non-disclosure agreement,
dated May 16, 2008, between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), and shall use such information and documents only in connection
with the Offer, and if this Agreement shall have been terminated Parent and
Purchaser shall deliver to the Company all such information and documents (and
all copies thereof).

1.4 Directors. (a) Promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser pursuant to the
Offer of such number of Shares as represents at least a majority of the then-
outstanding Shares, and from time to time thereafter, Purchaser shall be
entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Company Board as will give Purchaser representation on the
Company Board equal to the product of (x) the total number of directors on the
Company Board (after giving effect to any increase in the number of directors
pursuant to this Section 1.4) and (y) the percentage that such number of
Shares so purchased bears to the total number of Shares outstanding, and the
Company shall, upon request by Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the
Company Board or use its reasonable best efforts to secure the resignations
of such number of directors as is necessary to provide Purchaser with such
level of representation and shall cause Purchasers designees to be so elected
or appointed. The Company shall also cause individuals designated
by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage of each committee of the
Company Board as the percentage of the entire Company Board represented by
individuals designated by Purchaser. The Companys obligations to appoint
designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act. At the request of Purchaser, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to effect any such election or appointment of Purchasers designees,
including mailing to its stockholders the information required by Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder which, unless
Purchaser otherwise elects, shall be so mailed together with the Schedule
14D-9. Parent and Purchaser will supply to the Company all information with
respect to themselves and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated
thereunder.

(b) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees pursuant to
Section 1.4(a) and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or termination
of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, any extension of time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Purchaser under this Agreement, any waiver of compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions under this Agreement that are for the benefit of
the Company, any exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this
Agreement, any action to seek to enforce any obligation of Parent or Purchaser
under this Agreement (or any other action by the Company Board with respect
to this Agreement or the Merger if such other action adversely affects, or
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any of the holders of Shares
other than Parent or Purchaser) may only be authorized by, and will require
the authorization of, a majority of the directors of the Company then in
office who are directors of the Company on the date hereof or their successors
as appointed by such continuing directors (the "Continuing Directors");
_provided, however_ , that if there shall be no Continuing Directors as a
result of such individuals deaths, disabilities, resignations or refusal to
serve, then such actions may be effected by majority vote of the Independent
Directors, or, if no Independent Directors are then in office, by a majority
vote of the Company Board.

(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to Section 1.4(a), until the Effective Time, (i) the
Company Board shall have at least such number of directors as may be required
by the Nasdaq rules or the federal securities laws who are considered
independent directors within the meaning of such rules and laws ("Independent
Directors") and (ii) each committee of the Company Board that is required (or
a majority of which is required) by the Nasdaq rules or the federal securities
laws to be composed solely of Independent Directors shall be so composed;
_provided, however_ , that in such event, if the number of Independent
Directors shall be reduced below the number of directors as may be required by
such rules or laws for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent
Director(s) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who
shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or,
if no other Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate such number of directors, as may be required by the Nasdaq rules and
the federal securities laws, to fill such vacancies who shall not be
stockholders or Affiliates of Parent or Purchaser, and such Persons shall
be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

1.5 Top-Up Option. (a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Purchaser
an option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only after Purchasers acceptance
for payment of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the expiration
date of the Offer and payment for such Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Offer by depositing the aggregate purchase price therefor with the
Depositary (the "Depositary") for the Offer (the date and time of such deposit
with the Depositary being referred to as the "Purchase Time"), and prior to
the Effective Time, to purchase from the Company that number of Shares (the
"Top-Up Shares") equal to the number of Shares that, when added to the number
of Shares owned directly or indirectly by Parent or Purchaser immediately
following the consummation of the Offer, shall constitute one share more than
90% of the total Shares then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance
of the Top-Up Shares) at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price;
_provided, however_ , that (i) the Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only
once, at such time as Parent and Purchaser, directly or indirectly, own at
least 80% of the total number of Shares then outstanding and (ii) in no event
shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable to the extent it would be exercisable
for a number of Shares in excess of the Companys then authorized and unissued
shares of Common Stock (including as authorized and unissued shares of Common
Stock, for purposes of this Section 1.5, any Shares held in the treasury of
the Company).

(b) If Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or Purchaser
shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up
Shares that Purchaser wishes to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, and
(ii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Shares is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares,
Purchaser shall pay the Company (which payment, except to the extent of the
par value of the Top-Up Shares, may be in the form of a note) for the Top-Up-
Shares against delivery of certificates therefor.

(c) Parent and Purchaser understand that the Shares that Purchaser may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and will be issued
in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a
public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company
that Purchaser is, and will be upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, an
"accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act). Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the
Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise thereof are being and will be
acquired for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in
connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities
Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares may include any legends
required by applicable securities laws.

ARTICLE III __

_EFFECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS ON THE CAPITAL STOCK_

_OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS_

3.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

(a) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including shares of Restricted Stock which shall vest at the Effective Time
(except to the extent such vesting is waived pursuant to the Termination
Agreements and other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b)
and any Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive
the Offer Price in cash without interest (the "Merger Consideration"),
payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of such Shares in the manner
provided in Section 3.4;

(b) each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Parent, Purchaser or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and retired without any conversion thereof, and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and

(c) each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

3.2 Treatment of Equity Awards. (a) Substantially concurrently with the
approval of this Agreement by the Company Board, the Compensation Committee of
the Company Board has taken all actions so that (i) each option to acquire
Shares granted under any Option Plan (an "Option"), whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and
without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holder
thereof, be terminated and shall solely represent the right to receive from
the Company in exchange therefor, at the Effective Time or as soon as
practicable thereafter, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
number of Shares subject to such Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Offer Price, without interest, over the exercise price per Share subject to

Company Common Stock ("Restricted Stock") lapse immediately prior to and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time. Pursuant to such  



 

7 ##### Table of Contents

  

 action of the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, if the exercise
price per Share of an Option is equal to or greater than the Offer Price, then
by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on
the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holder thereof, the Option will be
cancelled without payment of any consideration to the holder. At the Effective
Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, Parent or Purchaser shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the holder of each Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for those Options
that are to be cancelled pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) the
amount in cash set forth in clause (i) of this Section 3.2(a).

(b) The Option Plan shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and any and all
rights under any provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement,
including any Company Employee Plan, providing for the issuance or grant of
any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company (other than
the right to receive the payment contemplated by Section 3.2(a)) shall be
canceled as of the Effective Time, except that all administrative and other
rights and authorities granted under the Option Plan to the Company, the
Company Board or any committee or designee thereof shall remain in effect and
shall reside with the Company following the Effective Time.

(c) The Company and Purchaser shall take any actions reasonably necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.2; it being understood that the
intention of the parties is that, and the Company covenants and agrees with
Parent and Purchaser that, immediately following the Effective Time no holder
of an Option or share of Restricted Stock or any participant in any Company
Employee Plan or other employee benefit arrangement of the Company shall have
any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock (including any "phantom"
stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Subsidiaries in respect of such Option or Restricted Stock or
pursuant to such Company Employee Plan or other arrangement. Any notice which
the Company shall deliver to the holders of Options or Restricted Stock or the
participants in any other Company Employee Plan or other employee benefit
arrangement of the Company setting forth such holders rights pursuant to
this Agreement shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent.

3.3 Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by holders of Shares that have properly
demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the
holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such
holders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holders Shares shall not
constitute Dissenting Shares and instead shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, as set forth in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, without
any interest thereon.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any appraisal
demands received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, make any payment with respect to any such
exercise of appraisal rights or offer to settle or settle any such rights.

3.4 Surrender of Shares. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent")
sufficient funds to timely make all payments pursuant to Section 3.4(b). Such
funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Purchaser or, after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided, that such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America
with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of
America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an
outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the "Certificates"), a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for
payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall
be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.4(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this ARTICLE III.

(c) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have
not been disbursed to holders of Certificates and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender
of their Certificates.

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation for
transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this ARTICLE III.

(e) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the
holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will
deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented
by such Certificate pursuant to this ARTICLE III.

3.5 Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or otherwise pursuant to this
Agreement (including pursuant to Section 3.2(a)) any amount as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by
the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, and
are paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with
applicable Law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or other Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

nonpublic information to such third party, the Company furnishes such
nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously furnished to Parent); and

(iii) the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to provide such
information or enter into such discussion or negotiations would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the

intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment (which
may be conditioned on the termination of this Agreement) contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Superior Offer or transaction contemplated thereby

thereof, a "Company Change of Recommendation"), if all of the following

Company Change of Recommendation;

(iii) after delivering the Company Change of Recommendation Notice, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement during such five-
Business Day period, and negotiate in good faith with respect thereto during
such five-Business Day period, as would enable the Company to proceed with
its recommendation to stockholders in favor of the Offer and the Merger
without making a Company Change of Recommendation;



 

40 ##### Table of Contents

  

(iv) the Company Board shall have determined (A) after consultation with
its financial advisor, that the terms of the Superior Offer are more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the terms of the Offer (as
they may be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (iii) above) and (B) after

this Section 7.3.

the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation: (i)
Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ as required by the HSR

other Law relating to the Offer or the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company
will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with any
Governmental Entity under this Section 7.6(a) to comply in all material
respects with all applicable Laws. Parent, Purchaser and the Company
each shall promptly supply the other with any information that may be

required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made

be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement. Any oral
or written communication with the Governmental Entity in connection with any
filings made pursuant hereto, shall be made jointly by the Company

either the Companys or Parents participation in such communication.

(c) _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, each party will use its reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, (i) consummate and make effective the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, that nothing in this Section 7.6 shall require Parent or Purchaser
to keep the Offer open beyond the expiration date set forth in the Offer (as

action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity; (iii) defend
any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the

 benefits expected to be derived by Parent or its Affiliates as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby or would be reasonably expected to
materially and adversely affect Parent or its Affiliates following the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any
takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Offer,

Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

contrary and except as set forth below, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall require Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any
Action of Divestiture. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture. For
purposes of this Agreement, an "Action of Divestiture" shall mean (i) any

of a trust or otherwise) of any shares of capital stock or of any business,
assets or properties of Parent, its subsidiaries or Affiliates, or of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) the imposition of any limitation on the
ability of Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or the Company or its

Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) the imposition of any impediment on
Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or the Company or its Subsidiaries
under any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, order or other
legal restraint governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade

or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or (C) the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which could
reasonably be expected to cause the failure of any of the Offer Conditions and
(ii) Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall, from the date
hereof through the Purchase Time, provide the Chief Executive Officer of
Parent weekly updates on the general business condition of the Company;
_provided, however_ , that no such notification or update shall affect the

obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided, further_ , that
the delivery of any notice or update pursuant to this Section 7.7(a) shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder.

(b) _By Parent_. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (i) any
representation or warranty made by Parent or Purchaser contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, (ii) any failure of Parent to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, (iii) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which would reasonably be expected to result in the Financing, or any
alternative financing as Parent may obtain, not being available for Purchaser
to purchase and pay for the Shares pursuant to the Offer and to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, _provided, however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties of Parent, Purchaser
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;
_provided, further_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
7.7(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder.

44 ##### Table of Contents

  

 including all consents, waivers and approvals set forth in Section 4.5 of
the Disclosure Schedule. In connection with seeking such consents, waivers
and approvals, the Company shall keep Parent informed of all material
developments and shall, at Parents request, include Parent in any discussions
or communications with any parties whose consent, waiver or approval is
sought hereunder. Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form
acceptable to Parent.

7.9 Termination of 401(k) Plans. Effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company, its Subsidiaries
and any ERISA Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each a "401(k) Plan")
unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that any such 401(k) plan
shall not be terminated. Unless, no later than ten Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Parent provides such written notice to the Company, then the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been
terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the

or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. Parent shall take all reasonable
steps necessary to permit each Employee/Service Provider who has received an
eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
from each 401(k) Plan, if any, to roll such eligible rollover distribution as
part of any lump sum distribution to the extent permitted by each 401(k) Plan
into an account under Parents 401(k) plan (the "Parents 401(k) Plan"), to
the extent permitted by Parents 401(k) Plan.

7.10 Indemnification.

(a) _Indemnity_. From and after the Purchase Time, Parent will and will cause
the Company and the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and advance expenses to
the Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents (the
"Indemnified Parties") against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements,
incurred in connection with any proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, pertaining to or
in connection with the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer,
director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company, or of another entity if
such service was at the request of or for the benefit of the Company, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, is permitted
to do so by Section 145 of the DGCL. The certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to (i) exculpation
that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained
in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on
the date hereof and (ii) indemnification and advancement of expenses that
indemnify and provide for the advancement of expenses to the Indemnified
Parties to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, which
provisions will not, except as required by Law, be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnified
Parties or any other person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was
a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company.

(b)  _Insurance_. Parent shall either (i) for a period of six years following
the Purchase Time, maintain in effect (A) the Companys currently existing
directors and officers liability insurance policies with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Purchase Time (including the
transactions contemplated hereby) or (B) directors and officers liability
insurance policies with respect to matters existing , occurring or allegedly
occurring at or prior to the Purchase Time (including the transactions
contemplated hereby) having terms and conditions at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as the Companys currently existing directors
and officers liability insurance, _provided, however_ , that in order to
maintain the Companys existing policies or provide equivalent coverage,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 200% of the aggregate annual premium paid or payable by
the Company for the policies the Company currently has in effect and,
_provided, further_ , that if the annual premium required to maintain the
Companys existing policies or provide equivalent coverage exceeds 200% of
the annual premium paid or payable by the Company for the policies the Company
currently has in effect, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall be
obligated to obtain policies with the greatest coverage available for an
annual premium not in  



 

45 ##### Table of Contents

  

 excess of 200% of the aggregate annual premium paid or payable by the
Company for the policies the Company currently has in effect or (ii) purchase,
or at the request of Parent (which request shall be made no later than two
weeks prior to the Purchase Time) the Company shall purchase in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, by the Purchase Time, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain, tail policies to the current
directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained on the date
of this Agreement by the Company, which tail policies (A) shall not have an
aggregate premium in excess of 200% of the aggregate annual premium paid or
payable by the Company for the policies the Company currently has in effect
(which amount is set forth in Section 7.10(b) of the Disclosure Schedule), (B)
shall be effective for a period from at least the Purchase Time through and
including the date six years after the Purchase Time with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the
Purchase Time, and (C) shall contain coverage that is at least as protective
to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by such policies of
the Company currently in effect (complete and accurate copies of which, or
binders therefor have been made available to Parent); _provided, however_ ,
that, if equivalent coverage under such tail policies cannot be obtained or
can be obtained only by paying an aggregate premium in excess of 200% of such
amount, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall only be required
to obtain (and the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to maintain)
as much coverage under such tail policies as can be obtained by paying an
aggregate premium equal to 200% of such amount.

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.10 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by contract or otherwise. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or
any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the indemnification
and other obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.

(d) The obligation of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
7.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in any manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom
this Section 7.10 applies without the consent of such Indemnified Party (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom Section 7.10
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.10, each of whom
may enforce the provisions of this Section 7.10).

7.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Purchase Time, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable
law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by ARTICLE I of this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

7.12 Compensation Approvals. Prior to the scheduled expiration date of the
Offer (as it may be extended hereunder), the Company (acting through its
Compensation Committee) will take all such steps as may be required to cause
any Compensation Arrangements entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2007 to be approved or ratified (to the extent
not previously so approved or ratified) as "employment compensation, severance
or other employee benefit arrangement" by the Compensation Committee comprised
solely of Independent Directors of the Company in accordance with
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act for purposes of satisfying the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of
the Exchange Act. Prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company Board nor
the Compensation Committee of the Company shall withdraw, nor permit the
withdrawal of, the Company Compensation Approvals. Prior to the expiration
date of the Offer, the Company will make available to Parent true and correct
copies of all approvals and other actions taken with respect to the Company
Compensation Approvals.

7.13 Financing. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use its reasonable best efforts to have its and their representatives,
including management, personnel, attorneys, financial advisors, accountants
and other professionals, cooperate with Parent and its representatives in
connection with the arrangements by Parent and Purchaser to obtain the
Financing (or any alternative Financing as Parent may obtain) as may be
reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or unreasonably interfere with or hinder or delay in any material
aspect the performance by the Company of its other obligations hereunder),
including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence
sessions, (ii) furnishing Parent and Purchaser and their financing sources
with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) assisting Parent and Purchaser
and their financing sources in the preparation of (A) an offering document
for any debt raised to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) mortgaging
or otherwise borrowing money against any Owned Real Property, the proceeds of
which the Company will hold as cash in furtherance of the Financing and (v)
reasonably facilitating the pledge of the Companys assets as collateral;
_provided, however_ , that none of the Company or its Subsidiaries will be
required in connection with the Financing or any alternative financing as
Parent may obtain or with respect to clauses (iv) and (v) to pay any
commitment or other similar fee (unless such commitment or fee is paid by
Parent) or incur any other liability or expense (unless such expense is paid
by Parent) that would accrue prior to the Purchase Time or consummate any of
the transactions referred to in clauses (iv) and (v) prior to the Purchase
Time. Prior to the Purchase Time, the Company shall (X), when requested by
Parent, monetize (at then standard commercial terms at not less than 50% of
face value) any auction-rate securities held by the Company or its
Subsidiaries (Parent and Purchaser hereby acknowledging that the market for
such auction-rate securities are illiquid at the present time) or (Y), if the
market for such auction-rate securities becomes liquid (whereby such
securities may be sold at no less than 100% of face value), monetize (at no
less than 100% of face value) any auction-rate securities held by the Company
or its Subsidiaries, and in the case of (X) or (Y), the proceeds of such
monetization shall be used by the Company solely to first, pay at the
Purchase Time amounts due under the Termination Agreements, and thereafter, to
the extent of any remaining proceeds, pay the amounts described in item 1 of
Section 4.7(f) of the Disclosure Schedule.

7.14 Termination Agreements.

(a) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that they are aware of the fact that Mr.
Dominic and Ms. Varisano entered into the Termination Agreements with the
Company. Parent acknowledges that following the Purchase Time it and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company following the Purchase Time) will not have
positions available for Mr. Dominic and Ms. Varisano comparable to
their respective current positions with the Company. Parent and Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that, given the positions available, following the
Purchase Time, Mr. Dominic and Ms. Varisano will have Good Reason (as defined
in each such executives employment agreement) to terminate their employment
with the Company and that Parent and Purchaser cannot or will not correct or
cure such Good Reason event. Parent and Purchaser further acknowledge and
confirm their understanding and agree that the Company will pay (if
applicable, with funds advanced to the Company by or on behalf of Parent
pursuant to Section 7.14(b)) at the Purchase Time in accordance with the
respective Termination Agreements the amounts provided for therein to be so
paid at such time, subject to any adjustments set forth therein, and will
report, for federal income tax purposes, such payments consistent with the
characterization thereof in the Termination Agreements. The Company shall not
amend or terminate either Termination Agreement or waive any provisions
therein without the prior written consent of Parent.

(b) If the Company reasonably determines within ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Purchase Time that it will require funds in addition to its cash on
hand to pay at the Purchase Time the amounts payable under the Termination
Agreements, and such requirement is not primarily caused by a breach by the
Company of its covenants in Section 6.1, then if requested in writing by the
Company no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Purchase Time (the
"Company Financing Request"), at the Purchase Time Parent shall lend, or
cause to be lent, to the Company (pursuant to a promissory note which shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery thereof
and may be prepaid without premium or penalty) the cash amount specified in
the  



 

47 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company Financing Request not exceeding $15,000,000 (the amount so specified
not exceeding $15,000,000, the "Company Financing Amount") for the sole
purpose of paying amounts required to be paid at the Purchase Time pursuant to
the Termination Agreements. If Parent is required to provide the Company
Financing Amount pursuant to this Section 7.14(b), then at the Purchase
Time it will deliver or cause to be delivered, by wire transfer of funds, the
Company Financing Amount to an account previously designated by the Company to
Parent. The Company shall use the Company Financing Amount solely for the
purpose of paying amounts due at the Purchase Time under the Termination
Agreements, and will provide or cause to be provided to Parent, within one
Business Day after the Purchase Time, a written receipt from Mr. Dominic and
Ms. Varisano or other written evidence of the receipt of such amounts.

Exhibit B

_CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit B and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement to which it is
attached (the "Merger Agreement").

1. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer and, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, may terminate or amend the Offer, unless, immediately prior to the expiration of the initial offering period for the Offer, as the same may be extended from time to time (the "Expiration Date"): 

(a) there shall have been validly tendered (not including any Shares tendered
pursuant to procedures for guaranteed delivery) in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn that number of Shares which, together with the number of Shares, if
any, then owned beneficially by Parent, Purchaser or their Subsidiaries,
constitutes at least a majority of the total number of then-outstanding Shares
on a fully diluted basis (which shall mean, as of any time, the number of
Shares outstanding, together with all Shares (if any) which the Company would
be required to issue pursuant to any then outstanding warrants, options,
benefit plans or obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable into
Shares or otherwise, but only to the extent then so exercisable, convertible
or exchangeable) on the date Shares are accepted for payment (the "Minimum
Tender Condition"); and

(b) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have expired or been
terminated, and any required approvals or consents in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been obtained under any
applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws (and any applicable waiting periods
thereunder have expired or been terminated).

2. Additionally, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer and, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, including Section 1.1, may terminate or amend the Offer if any of the following conditions exist: 

(a) there shall have been any Law, decree, judgment, order or injunction,
promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced, issued or amended by any
Governmental Entity that would, or is reasonably likely, directly or
indirectly, to: (i) restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the making or
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the transactions contemplated by
ARTICLE III of the Merger Agreement or seeking to obtain from the Company,
Parent or Purchaser any material damages; (ii) impose material limitations on
the ability of Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to acquire or hold, transfer or dispose of, or effectively to
exercise all rights of ownership of, some or all of the Shares including the
right to vote the Shares purchased by it pursuant to the Offer on an equal
basis with all other Shares on all matters properly presented to the
stockholders of the Company; (iii) require, or condition any approval on, the
divestiture by Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates of any Shares, or require Purchaser, Parent, the Company, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take, or condition any
approval on, any Action of Divestiture; or (iv) cause a Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) there shall be pending or threatened (and such threat shall not have been
withdrawn), any action, proceeding or counterclaim by or before
any Governmental Entity challenging the making or consummation of the Offer
or the Merger or seeking, directly or indirectly, to result in any of the
consequences referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of Paragraph 2(a) above;
  ##### Table of Contents

  

(c) a Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred;

(d) the Company shall have breached or failed to comply (i) in any material
respect with any of its obligations, covenants, or agreements under
the Merger Agreement which breaches or failures, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to constitute a Functional Breach or
(ii) with the covenants set for in Section 6.1(b)(i) through Section
6.1(b)(iv) of the Merger Agreement;

(e) (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.2 of the
Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct in all material respects at any
scheduled expiration of the Offer (except for any representation or warranty
therein that is expressly made as of a specified date, in which case as of
such specified date) or (ii) any other representations or warranties of the
Company contained in the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct at any
scheduled expiration of the Offer (except for any representation or warranty
that is expressly made as of a specified date, in which case as of such
specified date) where the failure of such representation or warranty to be
true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to constitute a Functional Breach; _provided_ , that, for purposes
of Paragraph 2(e)(ii) all such representations and warranties shall be
interpreted without giving effect to the words "materially" or "material" or
to any qualification based on such terms or based on the defined term
"Material Adverse Effect;"

(f) a Change of Board Recommendation shall have been effected or the Company
Board shall have failed to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within
three Business Days of a written request to do so by Parent; or

(g) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms or
shall have been amended pursuant to its terms to provide for such termination
or amendment of the Offer;

which, in the sole judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any case, makes it
inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with acceptance for payment or
payment for Shares.

For the purposes of this Exhibit B a "Functional Breach" shall mean any
breach of any representation or warranty of the Company, or any breach or
failure to comply with any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company,
under the Merger Agreement which breach or failure could reasonably be
expected to materially affect the business or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or the potential synergies which Parent anticipates to result
from the transactions contemplated thereby in the periods following the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

Immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a certificate executed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company certifying that the
conditions and events set forth in Paragraphs 2(d) and 2(e) of this Exhibit B
shall not exist or have not occurred as of such time and date. 

The conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Exhibit B are for the
benefit of Parent and Purchaser and, regardless of the circumstances, may be
asserted by Parent or Purchaser in whole or in part at any applicable time or
from time to time prior to the Expiration Date, except that the conditions
relating to receipt of any approvals from any Governmental Entity may
be asserted at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares, and
any condition may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in its discretion in whole
or in part at any applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject
to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent or Purchaser at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.
