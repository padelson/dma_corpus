PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

This PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, dated as of November 16, 2018 (this
"Agreement"), is entered into by and between NRP (Operating) LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ("Seller"), and VantaCore Intermediate Holding, LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company ("Buyer").

WHEREAS, Seller is the owner of all of the Equity Interests (collectively, the
"Interests") in VantaCore Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the "Company");

WHEREAS, the Company, through the Operating Companies (as defined below)
engages in the business of owning, leasing and/or operating (i) limestone
quarries, whether surface, subsurface or otherwise, (ii) an underground
limestone mine, (iii) sand and/or gravel plants, (iv) asphalt plants, and/or
(v) marine terminals, and/or providing paving, contracting and/or aggregate
brokerage services (collectively, and together with all other businesses as
presently conducted by any of the Acquired Companies, the "Business");

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from
Seller, all of the Interests on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein; and

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein without definition have the respective
meanings set forth in Article XII.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual promises contained
herein, the terms and provisions set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be
gained by the performance thereof and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 
PURCHASE AND SALE



SECTION 1.1 Purchase and Sale. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller,
and Seller agrees to convey to Buyer, the Interests, free and clear of all
Liens (except for Liens (i) arising under applicable securities Laws or (ii)
created by Buyer or any of its Affiliates).

SECTION 1.2 Calculation of Purchase Price.

(a) Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price to be paid by Buyer in
respect of the purchase and sale described in Section 1.1 shall be
$205,000,000 (the "Base Purchase Price"), as such amount is adjusted pursuant
to Sections 1.2(b) and 1.2(c) (the "Purchase Price").

(b) Closing Adjustment.

(i) No later than three Business Days before the Closing Date, Seller will
prepare and deliver to Buyer (A) an estimated unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company at and as of 12:01 A.M. Central time on the Closing Date
(the "Estimated Closing



Balance Sheet") and (B) a statement setting forth Seller\'s good faith
estimate of each of (i) the amount of the Closing Cash, (ii) any Closing
Working Capital Surplus, (iii) any Closing Working Capital Deficiency, (iv)
the Transaction Expenses, (v) the amount of Closing Indebtedness and (vi) the
Closing Adjustment Amount resulting therefrom (such statement, the "Estimated
Closing Statement"). Upon delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement, Buyer
and its Representatives, including Buyer\'s independent accountants, will be
entitled to review, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice, the books and records of the Acquired Companies relevant to the
preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing
Statement as Buyer may reasonably request, and to discuss such books and
records with senior management of the Acquired Companies for the purpose of
reviewing the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or Estimated Closing Statement,
and Seller shall consider in good faith any comments from Buyer with respect
to the amounts and calculations contained therein. To the extent that, prior
to Closing, Buyer and Seller agree in writing on any changes to the amounts
set forth in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or the Estimated Closing
Statement, the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or the Estimated Closing
Statement, as applicable, shall be revised to reflect such agreed-upon
amounts; for the avoidance of doubt (but without limiting Section 1.2(c)), if
Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any differences with respect to the
amounts set forth in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or the Estimated
Closing Statement prior to the Closing, then with respect to any amounts which
remain in dispute, the amounts of Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital
Surplus, Closing Working Capital Deficiency, Transaction Expenses, Closing
Indebtedness or the Closing Adjustment Amount as reflected in the Seller\'s
initial Estimated Closing Statement shall be used for purposes of calculating
the Estimated Purchase Price on the Closing Date. From and after 12:01 A.M.
Central time on the Closing Date through the Closing, no Acquired Company
shall pay or otherwise remit or distribute any Cash to any Person (other than
payments to unaffiliated third-party trade creditors in the ordinary course of
business in respect of liabilities included in Closing Working Capital taken
into account in calculating the Closing Working Capital Surplus or Closing
Working Capital Deficiency, as applicable).

(ii) The "Closing Adjustment Amount" shall be an aggregate amount equal to,
without duplication, (A) the amount of any Closing Cash, minus (B) the amount
of the Transaction Expenses, plus or minus, as applicable, (C) the amount of
any Closing Working Capital Surplus or any Closing Working Capital Deficiency,
as applicable, and minus, (D) the amount of any Closing Indebtedness, in each
case, as set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement. If the Closing
Adjustment Amount is a positive number, the Base Purchase Price shall be
increased by the amount of the Closing Adjustment Amount for purposes of
calculating the Estimated Purchase Price. If the Closing Adjustment Amount is
a negative number, the Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by the absolute
value of the amount of the Closing Adjustment Amount for purposes of
calculating the Estimated Purchase Price. The Base Purchase Price as adjusted
by the Closing Adjustment Amount pursuant to this Section 1.2(b)(ii) shall be
the "Estimated Purchase Price".

(c) Post-Closing Adjustment.

(i) No earlier than 30 days and no later than 75 days following the Closing
Date, Buyer will deliver to Seller an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
the Company at and as of 12:01 A.M. Central time on the Closing Date (the
"Closing Balance Sheet") and a statement



setting forth its good faith determination of the amount of (i) the Closing
Cash, (ii) the final amount of Transaction Expenses, (iii) any Closing Working
Capital Surplus, (iv) any Closing Working Capital Deficiency, (v) the Closing
Indebtedness and (vi) the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount resulting therefrom
(such statement, the "Closing Statement"). After receipt of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, Seller shall have 30 days (the
"Review Period") to review the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement. During the Review Period, Seller and its Representatives, including
Seller\'s independent accountants, will be entitled to review, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, the books and records of
the Company used in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement as Seller may reasonably request, and to discuss such books
and records with senior management of the Company for the purpose of reviewing
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement.

(ii) On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Seller may object to
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement by delivering to Buyer a
written statement setting forth Seller\'s objections in reasonable detail,
indicating each disputed item, amount in dispute and the basis for Seller\'s
disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Objections"). If Seller fails to
deliver the Statement of Objections prior to the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount proposed by Buyer shall be deemed to have been accepted by
Seller. If Seller delivers the Statement of Objections prior to the expiration
of the Review Period, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such objections for 30 days after the delivery of the Statement of
Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so resolved within
the Resolution Period, the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and
the resulting Post-Closing Adjustment Amount with such changes as may have
been previously agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer, shall be final and
binding.

(iii) If Seller and Buyer fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of
the matters set forth in the Statement of Objections before expiration of the
Resolution Period, then any amounts remaining in dispute (the "Disputed
Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to the office of Houlihan Lokey,
Inc. (the "Independent Valuation Firm") who, acting as experts and not
arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and adjust the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the resulting Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount accordingly, if necessary, based on the Independent Valuation Firm\'s
resolution of the Disputed Amounts. The Independent Valuation Firm shall only
decide the specific items under dispute by the parties. The Independent
Valuation Firm shall make a determination as promptly as reasonably
practicable within 30 days (or such other time period as the parties hereto
shall agree in writing) after their engagement, and their resolution of the
Disputed Amounts and any adjustments to the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement and the resulting Post-Closing Adjustment Amount shall be based
solely upon the memoranda and supporting material provided by the parties
hereto, and not pursuant to any independent review, and shall be conclusive
and binding upon the parties hereto (absent fraud or manifest error). In
resolving any Disputed Amount, the Independent Valuation Firm shall be bound
by the Working Capital Adjustment Principles, the applicable definitions set
forth in this Agreement and the other requirements of this Section 1.2(c) and
shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. The fees and expenses of the Independent Valuation
Firm shall be



paid by Seller, on the one hand, and by Buyer, on the other hand, based upon
the percentage of the Disputed Amounts contested but not awarded to Seller or
Buyer, respectively.

(iv) The "Post-Closing Adjustment Amount" shall be an amount equal to, without
duplication, (A) the amount of any Closing Cash, minus (B) the amount of the
Transaction Expenses, plus or minus, as applicable, (C) the amount of any
Closing Working Capital Surplus or any Closing Working Capital Deficiency, as
applicable, minus (D) the amount of any Closing Indebtedness, in each case, as
set forth in the Closing Statement as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.2(c). If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number,
the Base Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount for purposes of calculating the Final Purchase Price. If the
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Base Purchase Price
shall be decreased by the absolute value of the amount of the Closing
Adjustment Amount for purposes of calculating the Final Purchase Price. The
Base Purchase Price as finally adjusted by the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount
pursuant to this Section 1.2(c) shall be the "Final Purchase Price".

(v) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price (the
amount of such difference, if any, the "Overpayment Amount") (i) Buyer shall
be entitled to receive, and Buyer and Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to
distribute from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount to Buyer, an
amount equal to the Overpayment Amount (up to the amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount) and, to the extent that the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount is less than the Overpayment Amount, Seller shall pay
to Buyer an aggregate amount equal to the difference between the Overpayment
Amount and the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by Buyer, and (ii) Seller
shall be entitled to receive, and Buyer and Seller shall cause the Escrow
Agent to distribute to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account specified by Seller, the remaining portion, if any, of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount after payment of the Overpayment
Amount to the Buyer. If the Final Purchase Price is more than the Estimated
Purchase Price (the amount of such difference, if any, the "Underpayment
Amount"), then (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the
Underpayment Amount, and (ii) Buyer and Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by Seller, an amount equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount. Any payment or instruction to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Section 1.2(c)(v) shall be made, on the later of (1) the second (2nd) Business
Day after acceptance by Seller of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement (as contemplated by Section 1.2(c)(ii) above) or (2) the second
(2nd) Business Day following resolution of any Disputed Amounts as
contemplated by Section 1.2(c)(ii) or Section 1.2(c)(iii) above. Any amounts
payable by either party pursuant to this Section 1.2(c)(v) may not be reduced
by or set-off against any amounts payable (whether at such time or in the
future or upon the occurrence of a contingency) by the recipient or any
Affiliate of the recipient to the payor or any Affiliates of the payor. Any
payment pursuant to this clause (v) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller or Buyer, as
applicable.

SECTION 1.3 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, Buyer or the Acquired Companies shall have the right to deduct and
withhold any required Taxes



from any payments to be made hereunder; provided, however, except with respect
to payments in the nature of compensation to be made to employees or former
employees, Buyer shall provide Seller with a written notice of Buyer\'s
intention to withhold at least three (3) Business Days prior to any such
withholding and Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any such Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to Seller
or any other recipient of payment in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which
it owns, leases or operates property or assets, or conducts any business, so

available to Buyer an accurate and complete copy of each Acquired Company\'s
Organizational Documents, in each case, as amended, and each as so delivered

DLLCA) and such membership interests are the only Equity Interests of each
Acquired Company. Other than the Company\'s ownership of a 100% membership
interest in each of the Operating Companies, the Company does not own, nor has
ever owned during Seller\'s ownership of the Acquired Companies, directly or
indirectly (beneficially or of record), any Equity Interest or debt securities
of any Person. No Acquired Company owns, nor has ever owned during Seller\'s

expected to subject, any Acquired Company to any material Tax, fine, lien,
penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code, PPACA or any other
applicable Law. With respect to each Plan, all contributions, premiums, or
other payments that are due have been timely made or paid, and any such
amounts not yet due have been made or paid or properly accrued.

(d) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
code has received a favorable determination letter, from the IRS as to its
qualified stats under the Code or is maintained pursuant to a prototype
document approved by the IRS, and is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion
letter issued by the IRS with respect to such prototype document, and nothing
has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
Plan\'s qualified status.

(e) Except (x) as set forth on Schedule 4.15(e) and (y) with respect to the

pursuant to Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, (iv) a "multiple employer plan"
(within the meaning of Section 210 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code) or
(v) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as such term is defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA). No Acquired Company has any current or contingent
liability by reason of at any time being treated as a single employer with any
other Person under Section 414 of the Code.

(f) Except (x) as set forth on Schedule 4.15(f) and (y) with respect to the
Seller Retained Plans, as could not result in any Liability to any Acquired
Company, no Plan, other than any Seller Retained Plan, provides, and no
Acquired Company has promised to provide, post-termination or retiree welfare
benefits to any Person beyond those required by COBRA.

(g) There have been no "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code or Sections 406 or 407 of ERISA and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA and no breaches of fiduciary duty (as determined
under ERISA) with respect to any Plan that could reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability to any Acquired Company.

(h) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15(h), in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone
or in combination with any other event, no payments of money or other
property, acceleration of benefits, or provisions of other rights have been or
will be made hereunder, under any agreement contemplated herein, or under any
Plan, that would be reasonably likely to be nondeductible under Section 280G
of the Code, whether or not some other subsequent action or event would be
required to cause such payment, acceleration, or provision to be triggered.
The transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in



combination with any other event, will not accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any
employee, officer, director, equityholder or other service provider of any
Acquired Company under any Plan.

(i) Each Plan, other than, with respect to the Seller Retained Plans only, as
could not result in any Liability to any Acquired Company, which is a "non-
qualified deferred compensation plan" (as such term is defined in Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in a written form that complies with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and final regulations issued and
outstanding thereunder, such that it would not reasonably be expected that in
the event of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service of either the Company or
any individual participating in such Plan, the additional tax described in
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) would be assessed against any such participant with
respect to benefits due or accruing under such Plan. No Acquired Company has

its own account as an investment without the present intent to sell, transfer
or otherwise distribute the same to any other Person in violation of
applicable securities Laws. Buyer and its Affiliates have made, independently
and without reliance on Seller (except to the extent that Buyer has relied on

necessary to eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust or
competition Law to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as possible. The filing fees associated with the filings to be made
under the HSR Act shall be borne by Buyer.

review, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior written
request, its properties, books, Contracts, accounts, records and files and
(iii) provide such other information to Buyer and its Representatives as they
may reasonably request, in each case, which is (a) reasonably necessary to
assist Buyer with integration and transition planning in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise consummating such transactions,

not unreasonably interfere with the Business or the safe commercial operations
of the Acquired Companies (or, as appropriate, its Affiliates) and (2) is
reasonably related to Buyer\'s obligations and rights hereunder or the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that (w) Seller shall
have the right to have a Representative present for any communication with
employees or officers of the Company or its Affiliates, (x) Buyer shall and
shall cause its Representatives to observe and comply with all health, safety

materials upon such terms and conditions as shall be determined by such
accountants in their discretion, and (iii) any documents or information that
are protected by the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine
protections if Seller reasonably determines that providing copies or access to
such documents or information could give rise to a possible waiver of such
privilege protections after considering the parties\' arrangements to preserve
applicable privileges and protections; provided, that in the case of the
foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), Seller shall take all reasonable steps to
permit inspection of, or to disclose, such information and to respond in a
timely manner to all subsequent requests by Buyer based on such information on
a basis that it does not jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or work
product doctrine protections.

(b) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Acquired
Companies, their respective Affiliates and their respective Representatives
for any and all out-of-pocket Losses (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
overhead costs) incurred by such Persons arising out of the access rights

Representatives for any injuries or property damage while accessing any
Company Assets.

responsible for any breach of this Section 6.5(b) by any of such
Representatives or Affiliates to which it disclosed such information as if
such Representatives and Affiliates were bound by this Section 6.5(b));
provided, however, this Section 6.5(b) shall not apply to any information (x)
that is required to be disclosed by applicable Law (including securities
Laws), Governmental Authority, national securities exchange or self-regulatory
organizations having supervisory jurisdiction over such Person to be disclosed
(including any report, statement, testimony or other submission to such
Governmental Authority) or (y) that is reasonably necessary to be disclosed in
connection with any Legal Proceeding with respect to this Agreement (including
in response to any summons, subpoena or other legal process or formal or
informal investigative demand issued to the disclosing party in the course of
any Legal Proceeding). In the event Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives is required by Law to disclose any Company

with applicable Law.

(B) and (C), Buyer shall take commercially reasonable steps to permit
inspection of or to disclose such information and to respond in a timely
manner to all subsequent queries by Seller based on such information on a
basis that it does not jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or other legal
privilege or contravene any applicable Laws or fiduciary duties, or forego any
Trade Secret status.

period for which access to the Books and Records is reasonably necessary, in
which case such extension shall continue until any such Legal Proceeding or
investigation has been dismissed or settled through judgment or otherwise

shall only apply with respect to such Books and Records that are relevant to
such Legal Proceeding or investigation.

SECTION 6.7 Transaction Expense Invoices. No later than three Business Days

Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, as applicable,
cause the resignation of the individuals listed on Schedule 6.8(a) from the

employee benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension, equity or equity-

shall cause its Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i)
recognize, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and (for purposes of vacation
and severance benefits only) benefit levels and accruals service with Seller,

existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period
under any health plan; and (iii) provide full credit for any co-payments,
deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or similar payments such Continuing

the Closing Date, the Continuing Employees shall be permitted to continue
participating in each Seller Retained Plan that is a group health plan, and
that Buyer shall or shall cause the Acquired Companies to timely pay the
premium costs associated with providing such continued participation by the
Continuing Employees in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the
historical practices by which the Acquired Companies have paid such amounts to
the relevant Seller Retained Plan\'s plan sponsor.

responsible for all costs associated with the preparation and submission of
the VCP filing correcting all such operational or administrative failures.
Prior to the Company\'s submission of the VCP filing, a draft of such filing
shall be provided to Buyer for review and consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld).



(e) Nothing in this Section 6.8 amends, or will be deemed to establish, amend,
or prevent or restrict the amendment or termination of, any Plan or any other
employee benefit or compensation plan, program, or arrangement. No provision
of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment
(or any particular term of employment) for any employee for any period of time

terminate, or waive any provision of the RandW Policy in a manner adverse to
Seller or any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of Seller.

SECTION 6.12 Insurance.

included in the Company Assets as of the Closing. Subject to Sections 6.12(b)
and 6.12(c), Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing post-Closing

businesses and for any claims made with respect to the Acquired Companies and
their respective businesses arising following the Closing. In the event that

of such current asset(s) shall be received for the benefit and the account of
Buyer as a Company Asset, and Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable Non-
Company Affiliate to, within five (5) Business Days, transfer and remit to

(b) Without limiting the rights of Buyer or the Acquired Companies elsewhere
in this Agreement, if (x) any claims under any and all insurance policies
maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates which provide insurance coverage
for claims relating in any way to losses of



an Acquired Company that arise out of any act, omission, occurrence, fact or
circumstance existing on or prior to the Closing (the "Seller Policies") are
made prior to the Closing Date or (y) any losses occur prior to the Closing
Date in respect of which claims may be made against any Seller Policy, then
Seller shall, at Buyer\'s sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that Buyer or the Acquired Companies, as applicable, can
submit notice of a claim and otherwise continue to pursue such claims and
recover proceeds under the terms of such policy or policies, and Seller agrees
to otherwise cooperate with, and provide commercially reasonable assistance
to, the Acquired Companies, upon their reasonable written request and at
Buyer\'s sole cost and expense, in connection with the pursuit of any such
claim, including to make the benefits of any such insurance policies available
to the Acquired Companies and, as necessary or requested, submitting such
claim on behalf of the Acquired Companies, acting as the direct contact with
such insurer and using commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such claim on
behalf of the Acquired Companies, in each case, at Buyer\'s sole cost and
expense; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that such claims shall
be subject to all of the terms and conditions of such insurance policies.

(c) If, after the Closing Date, Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) reasonably
requires any information pertaining to, and for the purpose of making or
pursuing, a claim or a pre-Closing act, omission, occurrence or fact that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim under the Seller Policies
for which Buyer or its Affiliates require and are entitled to access to the
Seller Policies pursuant to Section 6.12 in order to give notice to or make
filings with insurance carriers or claims adjustors or administrators or to
adjust, administer or otherwise manage a claim with respect thereto, then
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such information to
be supplied to Buyer (or its designee) at Buyer\'s sole cost and expense to
the extent such information is in its possession or control or can be
reasonably obtained by Seller, upon a written request therefor.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.12, Seller shall
have no obligations under this Section 6.12 unless such obligations, (i) do
not unreasonably interfere with the normal, safe commercial operations of the
business of Seller (or, as appropriate, its Affiliates) and (ii) do not
require Seller or any of its Affiliates to disclose any (x) Trade Secrets or
other competitively sensitive information, (y) information that is subject to
any applicable attorney-client, work product or other legal privilege and the
disclosure of which would, based on the advice of outside counsel, waive such
privilege or (z) information or access that relates to any dispute between the
parties hereto or any of their respective Representatives. In furtherance of
the foregoing, if any third party requires the consent of Seller or any of its
Affiliates to the disclosure of claims data or information maintained by an
insurance company or other third party in respect of any such claim, such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) In connection with, and prior to or at, the Closing, Seller shall, and if
applicable, shall cause its Affiliates to, place into runoff for a period of 6
years, at the sole cost and expense of Seller, (i) the Acquired Companies\'
portion of the NRP environmental liability (pollution) insurance and (ii)
employment practices liability / fiduciary liability insurance maintained for,
or on behalf of, the Acquired Companies.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.12, prior to
the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the

Closing at no cost or expense to Seller or any Non-



Company Affiliate. Any such Insurance Policies that remain in place as of the
Closing shall be Company Assets.

series of transactions). The licenses granted pursuant to this Section 6.13,
shall not be effective until the Closing Date. AS OF THE CLOSING DATE, SUCH
LICENSES, AND THE SUBJECT MATTER THEREOF, ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS"

that nothing herein shall prohibit any Person subject to this Section 6.14 or
any of its Affiliates from being a passive owner of not more than two percent
(2%) of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly
traded so long as none of such Persons has any active participation in the
business of such corporation, or (ii) induce or attempt to induce any
customer, supplier or other business relation of any Acquired Company, at any
time prior to the Closing, to cease doing business with the Acquired Companies
or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer,
supplier or business relation and Acquired Companies in a manner harmful to
the Acquired Companies.

(b) Until the third (3rd) anniversary of Closing, (i) induce or attempt to
induce any Person who was an employee of any Acquired Company on the Closing
Date or within the one (1)-year period immediately prior to the Closing Date
to leave the employ of such Acquired Company, or in any way interfere with the
relationship between such Acquired Company and any such employee in a manner
harmful to the Acquired Companies, except as part of (or arising from) a
general solicitation, search, or advertisement for employees or consultants
through public advertisements not targeted at such employees or (ii) hire any
person who was an employee of any Acquired Company on the Closing Date or at
any time during the one (1)-year period immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(c) During the Non-Compete Period, if NRP or any of its controlled Affiliates
(the "Offeror") intends to engage in a marketing process for the purpose of
entering into, or otherwise seeks to solicit offers to enter into, any
Contract with a third-party to rent, license or lease or grant a comparable
right to use (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in exchange for a royalty
or similar fee or payment) to such third-party any real property and/or known
or expected reserves located in any Restricted County for the purpose(s) of
mining, quarrying or other development of limestone, sand, gravel or granite
(a "Restricted Lease Transaction"), Seller shall first provide written notice
of such proposed Restricted Lease Transaction (a "Lease Notice") to Buyer,
which such Lease Notice shall disclose in reasonable detail the real property
and/or potential reserves proposed to be involved in such Restricted Lease
Transaction and the economic and other material terms on which the Offeror
proposes to rent, license, lease or grant a comparable right to use such
property or reserves. Buyer or one of its Affiliates may elect to make an
offer to enter into such Restricted Lease Transaction by giving written notice
of such offer (including the economic and other material terms thereof
proposed by Buyer or such Affiliate thereof) to Seller within ninety (90) days
after the Lease Notice has been delivered to Buyer pursuant to Section 13.3
(the "Election Period") and, for the avoidance of doubt, neither NRP nor any
of NRP\'s controlled Affiliates may, directly or



indirectly, consummate or enter into any agreement to consummate such
Restricted Lease Transaction during such Election Period. If, following the
expiration of the Election Period, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
have made an offer to enter into such Restricted Lease Transaction, or Seller
rejects any offer(s) made by Buyer or its Affiliates during such Election
Period with respect to such Restricted Lease Transaction, then the Offeror may
enter into such Restricted Lease Termination with a third-party within one
hundred twenty (120) days of the end of the Election Period; provided,
however, that if Buyer or one of its Affiliates made an offer in respect of
such Restricted Lease Transaction during the Election Period, then the Offeror
may only enter into such Restricted Lease Transaction with a third-party on
terms more favorable to the Offeror than those offered by Buyer or its
Affiliate. For the avoidance of doubt, if such Restricted Lease Transaction is
not consummated within the one hundred twenty (120) day period set forth
herein, thereafter any Offeror that intends to engage in a marketing process
for the purpose of entering into, or otherwise seeks to solicit offers to
enter into, any subsequent Restricted Lease Transaction shall be required to
comply with the procedures set forth herein.

(d) During the Non-Compete Period, if NRP or any of its controlled Affiliates
(the "Offeree") receives an unsolicited offer from a third-party to enter into
a Restricted Lease Transaction (an "Offer"), then prior to consummating, or
entering into any agreement to consummate, such Offer, Seller shall first
provide written notice of such Offer (an "Offer Notice") to Buyer, which such
Offer Notice shall disclose in reasonable detail the real property and/or
reserves subject to the Offer and the economic and other material terms of the
Offer. Buyer or one of its Affiliates may elect to enter into such Restricted
Lease Transaction on the terms of the Offer by giving written notice of such
election to Seller within ninety (90) days after the Offer Notice has been
delivered to Buyer pursuant to Section 13.3 (the "Offer Period") and, for the
avoidance of doubt, neither NRP nor any of NRP\'s controlled Affiliates may,
directly or indirectly, consummate or enter into any agreement in respect of
the Offer or otherwise consummate such Restricted Lease Transaction during
such Offer Period. If, following the expiration of the Offer Period, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates have so notified Seller of their election to
enter into such Restricted Lease Transaction on the terms of the Offer, then
the Offeree may consummate the Offer within one hundred twenty (120) days of
the end of the Offer Period. For the avoidance of doubt, if such Restricted
Lease Transaction is not consummated within the one hundred twenty (120)‑day
period set forth herein, thereafter any Offeree that receives an Offer shall
be required to comply with the procedures set forth herein.

SECTION 6.15 Release Letters. No later than (x) three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer substantially final release
letters, and (y) one (1) day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver
Buyer final release letters (which may be unsigned) to be dated on or prior to
the Closing Date, in each case, in a customary form and substance, in respect
of the Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies set forth on Schedule 6.15, in
each case providing that the Acquired Companies will be fully released from
any and all obligations under such Indebtedness and any related Liens
burdening the Interests and/or the Company Assets will be released, in each
case, upon Closing, and granting Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their
respective Representatives the authority (including as authorized or
designated by Seller) to file all such applicable Lien release documents, and
containing such other terms as are customary for transactions similar to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including delivery of all possessory



collateral with respect to the Interests and/or the Company Assets in the
possession of the collateral agent, lender or holder in respect of such
Indebtedness.

SECTION 6.16 Exclusivity. From and after the date of this Agreement through
the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, Seller shall
not, and Seller shall cause each of NRP\'s controlled Affiliates and instruct
each of their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a)
submit, solicit, initiate, encourage or discuss any proposal or offer from any
Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby) or enter into any agreement or accept any
offer relating to or consummate any (i) reorganization, liquidation,
dissolution or recapitalization of any of the Acquired Companies, (ii) merger
or consolidation involving any of the Acquired Companies, (iii) purchase or
sale of all or any material portion of the assets or equity interests (or any
rights to acquire, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, any
such equity interests) of any of the Acquired Companies (other than the
purchase and sale of inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business) or (iv)
similar transaction or business combination involving any of the Acquired
Companies or their business or assets (each of the foregoing transactions
described in clauses (i) through (iv), an "Acquired Company Transaction") or
(b) furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in or
facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person (other than
Buyer and its Affiliates) to do or seek to do any of the foregoing. Sellers
shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, notify Buyer immediately if
any Person (other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates) makes any proposal,
offer, inquiry or contact with respect to an Acquired Company Transaction.

SECTION 6.17 Financing Cooperation.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause each of
the Acquired Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
reasonable cooperation and assistance that is customary or necessary, and as
reasonably requested by Buyer (with reasonable prior notice), in connection
with the arrangement of any debt financing (including, but not limited to any
"asset-based loan financing") (any such debt financing, the "Debt Financing")
to be incurred by Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including using commercially reasonable efforts to: (A) furnishing
Buyer with available financial information and statements with respect to the
Acquired Companies as may reasonably be required by Buyer and customary for
financing transactions, (B) furnishing Buyer with all documentation and other
information required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-
your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
Patriot Act, (C) upon reasonable prior notice and in reasonably convenient
locations (or via telephonic meeting), making senior management of the
Acquired Companies available to participate in a reasonable and limited number
of meetings and due diligence sessions with proposed lenders, (D) causing
officers of the Acquired Companies who have been identified by Buyer in
writing to Seller as individuals who will be officers after the Closing Date
to take reasonable corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing (including
executing and delivering at Closing any pledge and security documents, other
definitive financing documents, payoff letters, and officer\'s, solvency,
insurance and other certificates and documents as reasonably requested by
Buyer) and (E) cooperating with Buyer in customary actions in connection with
"asset based" loans, including



appraisals, field exams, inspections or other similar actions reasonably
requested by Buyer; provided, however, that (i) such requested cooperation
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business of the Acquired Companies,
or provide any information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted
by Law, (ii) none of the Seller, the Acquired Companies or any of their
Affiliates or any Representatives of the foregoing shall be required to take
any action that (A) would subject such Person to any actual or, (B) be
reasonably likely to subject such person to any potential Liability, to bear
any out of pocket cost or expense or to pay any commitment or similar fee or
incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in
connection with the arrangement of any Debt Financing or their performance of
their respective obligations under this Section 6.17 or any information
utilized in connection therewith and its and their respective Representatives
for any such fees or liabilities and Buyer and its Affiliates will indemnify
and hold harmless Seller, the Acquired Companies, its and their Affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives for any such fees or Liabilities and
the performance of their respective obligations under this Section 6.17 and
any information utilized in connection therewith (except to the extent Seller
has acted in bad faith or committed a willful and intentional breach with
respect to its obligations under this Section 6.17), (iii) no Acquired Company
nor its officers, managers, directors or employees shall be required to
execute any solvency certificate or authorization letter in connection with
the Debt Financing that would be effective prior to the Closing, (iv) persons
who are on the board of directors/managers or the board of directors/managers
of each Acquired Company solely prior to the Closing in their capacity as such
shall not be required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize
the execution of the Debt Financing, (v) no obligation of any Acquired Company
or any of its representatives undertaken pursuant to the foregoing shall be
effective until the Closing, (vi) nothing contained in this Section 6.17(a) or
otherwise shall require any Acquired Company, prior to the Closing, to be an
issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing and (vii) neither
Seller nor the Acquired Companies nor any of their respective officers,
managers, directors or employees shall be obligated to seek consents from any
third parties (including lessors) to facilitate or permit the Debt Financing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will any failure by Seller or any of its Affiliates to comply with this
Section 6.17 be used by Buyer as a basis to terminate this Agreement or assert
the failure of any condition to closing set forth in Article VIII to be
satisfied, except the extent Seller has acted in bad faith or committed a
willful and intentional breach with respect to its obligations in this Section
6.17. Buyer\'s obligations under Section 6.17(a)(ii) and Section 6.17(c) shall
survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, as applicable.

(c) Within thirty (30) days following the Closing, Buyer shall, promptly upon
request of Seller, reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller, any Acquired
Company or their respective Affiliates (including those of accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives to the extent of
cooperation requested by Buyer) in connection with the cooperation required by
this Section 6.17.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in this Agreement,
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this



Agreement is not conditioned upon the receipt by Buyer of the proceeds of the
Debt Financing and that any failure by Buyer to consummate the Closing on the
Closing Date solely by reason of absence of the Debt Financing shall
constitute a breach by Buyer of this Agreement.

SECTION 6.18 IT Migration. Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)
(a) during the period of time from the date hereof until the earlier of the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement, cause the Acquired Companies to
prepare to commence the IT Migration Activities promptly following the
Closing, and (b) promptly following the date hereof, use commercially
reasonable efforts to complete the Dual Authentication Migration. Following
the Closing and until the successful completion of the IT Migration
Activities, Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to): (i) upon the
Company\'s reasonable request, cooperate with and provide assistance to the
Acquired Companies (or their successor service provider(s)) in connection with
the performance of the IT Migration Activities, including by providing
reasonable access to Seller\'s and its Affiliates\' employees, IT
infrastructure and assets, and facilities (including its "Cyrus One"
facility), in each case, to the extent necessary to successfully complete the
IT Migration Activities and by providing access to the Company\'s server in
such "Cyrus One" facility; and (ii) refrain from intentionally engaging in any
acts or omissions that it knows, or reasonably should know, will (x) adversely
affect the IT Migration Activities or (y) prevent the Acquired Companies from
using Viewpoint, FAS, Financial Manager, domain controllers owned by Seller or
any of its Affiliates or dual authentication in the same or substantially same
manner as used by the Acquired Companies prior to the date hereof. For
clarity, nothing in this Section 6.18 obligates Seller or its Affiliates to
incur any out of pocket costs in connection with the IT Migration Activities.

SECTION 6.19 Release of Liens. From and after the date of this Agreement
through the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to effectuate the release and removal of all Liens set
forth on Schedule 6.19. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Seller\'s
compliance with the foregoing sentence, the failure to cause the release and
removal of such Liens prior to Closing shall not, in and of itself, constitute
a breach of this Section 6.19.

ARTICLE VII 
TAX MATTERS

SECTION 7.1 Tax Returns and Reporting. For Tax Returns that are required to be
filed with respect to a Tax period that occurs (either fully or partially) in
2018, (i) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file all Tax
Returns of or relating to any of the Acquired Companies required to be filed
on or before the Closing Date and shall be responsible for the timely payment
of the amount of all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns to the
relevant Taxing Authority, and (ii) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be

cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

SECTION 7.3 Cooperation. The Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or
activities of the Acquired Companies (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
providing access to books, records and other information (i) relating to the
Form 5500 Correction described in Section 11.4(b) and (ii) necessary for NRP
to prepare and file its Tax Returns). The control and conduct of any
proceeding relating to Taxes that is a Third-Party Claim shall be governed by
Section 11.4.

SECTION 7.4 Tax Treatment of Payments. All amounts payable under Article XI
shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all federal income
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

SECTION 7.5 Purchase Price Allocation. Schedule 7.5 sets forth the allocation
principles for purposes of allocating the Purchase Price and any other items
constituting consideration for applicable income Tax purposes (to the extent
known at such time) among the Company Assets in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code. Within sixty (60) days following the finalization of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount in accordance with Section 1.2(c), Seller shall
provide Buyer with an allocation of the Purchase Price and any other items
constituting consideration for applicable income Tax purposes (to the extent
known at such time) among the Company Assets in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code (the "Purchase Price Allocation") for Buyer\'s review, comment and
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Seller and Buyer agree to amend the Purchase Price Allocation to
reflect adjustments to the Purchase Price and to report the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement consistently with the Purchase Price
Allocation, as adjusted by the parties hereto, on any Tax Return, including
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and will not assert, and will cause their
Affiliates not to assert, in connection with any Tax audit or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes, any asset values or other items inconsistent with the
amounts set forth on the Purchase Price Allocation except with the agreement
of the other parties or as required by applicable Law.

doubt, no party shall be entitled to specific performance or other injunctive
or equitable relief under Section 13.7 except with respect to, and in
accordance with, any provision that otherwise survives such termination
pursuant to this Section 10.2) shall survive any termination; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall relieve a breaching or defaulting party for
liability to the extent the termination is the result of a willful and
intentional breach of, or willful and intentional non-compliance by, such
party of a representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement,
in which case the non-breaching party may pursue any legal or equitable
remedies to which it may be entitled with respect thereto.

INDEMNIFICATION



SECTION 11.1 Survival. The representations and warranties of Seller in this
Agreement (and any certificate delivered hereunder) shall terminate as of the
Closing. The representations and warranties of Buyer in this Agreement (and
any certificate delivered hereunder and rights to indemnification in respect
thereof) shall survive the Closing and continue in effect until the one-year
anniversary of the Closing Date. All covenants and agreements that by their
terms are to be performed prior to or on the Closing Date (except for those
covenants of Seller contained in Section 6.17) shall survive the Closing and
continue in effect for 75 days following the Closing Date and all covenants
and agreements that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part
subsequent to the Closing shall remain in full force until such particular
covenant or agreement is fully performed



as provided in this Agreement; provided, that Seller\'s indemnification
obligations with respect to the Form 5500 Correction shall survive the Closing
until the date that such correction is completed in accordance with applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) any covenant or agreement (and any
claim for Losses resulting from any breach, non-fulfillment, non-performance
or violation thereof, including Fraud) shall survive the time at which it
would otherwise terminate pursuant to this Section 11.1 if notice of a claim
of any breach thereof is delivered pursuant to this Agreement prior to the
applicable termination date set forth in this Section 11.1 until such claim is
finally and fully resolved in accordance with this Agreement and applicable
Law, and (y) nothing in this Section 11.1 shall limit the rights and
obligations of the parties hereto, or the resolution of any dispute, under
Section 1.2(c).

SECTION 11.2 Seller\'s Indemnification Obligations. Subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article XI, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall
indemnify and hold Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies)
and each of their respective officers, directors, managers, partners, members,
shareholders, general or limited partners, representatives, agents and
employees and any of the respective heirs, successors or permitted assigns
(the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all Losses

the part of the Indemnified Party to indemnification under this Article XI,
the Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Third-Party Claim to
the Indemnifying Party as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days after receiving written notice of such
Third-Party Claim) reasonably describing the Third-Party Claim; provided,
however, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve
the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have



hereunder with respect to such Third-Party Claim, except to the extent (and
only to the extent) that such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
results in Losses to the Indemnifying Party that are greater than such Losses
would have been had the Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying Party such
notice hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume (with
legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) at its sole cost
and expense the defense of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the
Indemnifying Party shall have notified the Indemnified Party in writing of its
intention to do so and acknowledging the Indemnifying Party\'s responsibility
for such Third-Party Claim and stating that all related Losses shall be
indemnified hereunder without reservation of rights (but subject to the
monetary limitations set forth in this Article XI); provided, further, that
the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume and/or control the
defense of any such Third-Party Claim if (1) such Third-Party Claim involves
criminal allegations, (2) such Third-Party Claim seeks injunctive or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (3) a conflict of interest
exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party with respect
to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (4) an adverse determination with
respect to such Third-Party Claim would reasonably be expected to materially
injure the Indemnified Party\'s relationship with its current business
relations, (5) the Losses relating to such Third-Party Claim together with all
other indemnification claims made would reasonably be expected to exceed the
maximum amount that the Indemnified Party would be entitled to recover under
this Article XI taking into account the limitations on indemnification herein,
(6) such Third-Party Claim relates to Taxes, (7) any of Buyer\'s insurance
carriers has assumed the defense thereunder pursuant to such applicable
insurance policy or (8) upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the
appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to
reasonably defend such Third-Party Claim (in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall thereafter pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the
Indemnified Party). If the Indemnifying Party is not permitted to assume the
defense, elects not to assume the defense or fails to assume the defense
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receiving notice of such Third-Party
Claim as set forth in this Section 11.4(a), then the Indemnified Party (A)
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to represent or defend it against any
such Third-Party Claim, and the reasonable out of pocket attorney\'s fees
incurred by the Indemnified Party for such counsel will be included in the
Indemnified Party\'s Losses; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party\'s
Losses shall not, in connection with any Legal Proceeding or separate but
substantially similar Legal Proceedings arising out of the same general
allegations, include the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of
attorneys at any time for all Indemnified Parties, except to the extent that
local counsel, in addition to its regular counsel, is required in order to
effectively defend against such Legal Proceeding, and (B) shall have the right
to consent to the entry of judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to or otherwise compromise or resolve a Third-Party Claim; provided, however,
that at least ten (10) days prior thereto, the Indemnified Party has provided
written notice of its intention to settle, compromise or otherwise resolve
such Third-Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party
has given its prior written consent to the Indemnified Party with respect
thereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party\'s consent will not
be required if such settlement will result in an amount of Losses of the
Indemnified Party(ies) with respect to such Third-Party Claim (without regard
to coverage under the RandW Policy) which are not indemnifiable hereunder in
excess of the amounts for which the Indemnified Party(ies) would be entitled
to indemnification hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party does assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall



have the right to participate in (but not control) the defense of such Third-
Party Claim. In such case, the Indemnified Party shall bear the cost of such
counsel unless (x) the engagement of separate legal counsel has been
specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (y) a conflict
of interest exists or arises between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party or (z) one or more defenses are available to the
Indemnified Party which are not available to the Indemnifying Party, in which
case, such expenses shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. Whether or not
the Indemnified Party retains its own counsel when the Indemnifying Party has
elected to control and is controlling in accordance with this Section 11.4(a),
the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate in providing information to
and consulting with the Indemnified Party about the Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement with respect to any Third-Party
Claim it has assumed the defense of unless such settlement (i) includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Parties for liability arising out of
such claim, (ii) does not involve any injunctive or other equitable relief
binding on any Indemnified Party or any finding or admission of any violation
of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party and (iii) none
of the Indemnified Parties will be obligated to make any payments or other
disbursements, or otherwise incur any financial liability, in connection with
such settlement, compromise or other resolution.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 11.4(a) to the contrary, after the
Closing, Seller shall continue the Form 5500 Correction using Whitley Penn
LLP, and Buyer shall have the right to participate in (but not control) such
correction actions. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in providing
information to and consulting with each other about the Form 5500 Correction
and the associated correction actions. Seller shall have the right to consent
to the entry of judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to or
otherwise compromise or resolve the Form 5500 Correction (or any aspect
thereof); provided, however, at least ten (10) days prior thereto, Seller has
provided written notice to Buyer of its intention to settle, compromise or
otherwise resolve such Form 5500 Correction (or any aspect thereof) and Buyer
has given its prior written consent to Seller with respect thereto (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Losses
with respect to the Form 5500 Correction shall consist of all Taxes, interest,
penalties, and reasonable audit fees and expenses (including attorneys\' fees
and other third party fees) incurred in connection with the Form 5500
Correction, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such amounts relating
to any other compliance or similar related issues identified in the course of
the Form 5500 Correction to the extent arising from actions or omissions taken
prior to the Closing Date, regardless of whether incurred by Buyer, Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates.

SECTION 11.5 Procedures.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article XI for a claim that is
not a Third-Party Claim covered by Section 11.4 unless it has duly delivered a
written notice to the Indemnifying Party (a "Notice of Claim") before the
applicable survival period set forth in Section 11.1 setting forth: (i) a
statement that such Indemnified Party believes an indemnification obligation
has been triggered or that in good faith that there is or has been a breach or

Indemnified Party is entitled to be held harmless and indemnified under this
Article



XI, (ii) a brief description of the circumstances supporting such Indemnified
Party\'s reasonable belief that there is or has been such a breach or payment
obligation triggered and (iii) to the extent then known and practicable, a
good faith estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of actual and potential
Losses for which it is entitled to be indemnified hereunder and that have
arisen and may arise as a result of the breach (the "Claimed Amount").

(b) If during the 30-Business Day period commencing upon the receipt of a
Notice of Claim, the Indemnifying Party delivers to the Indemnified Party a
written response (the "Response Notice") in which the Indemnifying Party
objects to the payment of some or all of the Claimed Amount to such
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall
attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party are unable to resolve the
dispute during the 30-day period commencing upon the receipt of the Response
Notice by the Indemnified Party, then such dispute (and any other disputes
relating to the Claimed Amount or the related Indemnification Claim) shall be
settled by any legally available in accordance with the procedures in Section
13.10 or as otherwise agreed in writing between the parties. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to timely deliver a Response Notice, the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have accepted, and shall be responsible for, the
Claimed Amount.

Article XI shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties for all
matters covered or contemplated by this Agreement (including any breach or
non-performance of a covenant); provided, however, that nothing herein shall
limit the right of any party to seek specific performance or injunctive relief
in accordance with Section 13.7. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO
THE CONTRARY, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM PURSUANT TO SECTION 10.2, SECTION
11.2 OR SECTION 11.3 OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, (i) CONSEQUENTIAL
AND INDIRECT DAMAGES WILL ONLY BE RECOVERABLE HEREUNDER TO THE EXTENT THAT

OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES FOR PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT
NOT PAID OR PAYABLE TO A THIRD PARTY. Notwithstanding anything in this

limit or restrict any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties\' rights to maintain or

Transaction Document and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby after
the Closing between Buyer or the Company, on the one hand,



and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, Vinson and Elkins may
represent Seller or its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests
of Seller or its Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer or the Company

substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for
the Company at any time prior to the Closing. Buyer (on behalf of itself and
the Company) and Seller each further agree that any and all documents in
