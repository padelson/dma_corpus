elsewhere in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings assigned
thereto in _Annex A_.

 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_

common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") then outstanding (other than Excluded Shares (as defined
below)) will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
seventeen Dollars and forty cents ($17.40) in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
(i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, are advisable, (ii) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in

its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iv) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company Stockholders_
") adopt this Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition

Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company are entering into a
Voting Agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which and subject

well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the

Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_."
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on
the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to
be consummated under the DGCL by filing a certificate of merger in customary

(i) _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to the terms of _Section 7.10_,
at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall
be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit A_

thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL
and such Certificate of Incorporation.

 

(ii) _Bylaws_. Subject to the terms of _Section 7.10_, at the Effective Time,
the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that at the Effective Time the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "Apigee Corporation."

 

(b) _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(i) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

(ii) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

 

Section 1.3 _General Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall
be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises

all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Merging
Corporations_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub
shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Common Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) _Generally_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or any other

2 ##### Table of Contents

  

 accordance with _Section 1.4(d)_, but excluding (i) Cancelled Shares or
(ii) Dissenting Shares, which Dissenting Shares shall have only those rights
set forth in  _Section 1.4(b)(iii)_ (the Shares described in the preceding
clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be canceled
and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon the surrender of the certificate, if any,
representing such Share or the transfer of such non-certificated Shares
represented by book entry (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") in the manner provided
in  _Section 2.2(c)_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the
manner provided in _Section 2.2(d)_); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Merger Consideration and other similarly dependent items shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time; _provided, further_ , that nothing in the
foregoing proviso shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. From and after
the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to
this _Section 1.4(b)(i)_. The Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a certificate representing
Shares is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then such
certificate shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 1.4(b)_.

 

(ii) _Cancelled Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or any other Person,
each Share that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, including any
Shares held in the treasury of the Company, or by any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Cancelled Shares_ "), shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor.

(iii) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing
and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as
the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law
with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of
the appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(in such case, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with regard thereto except with regard
to such holders right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares to
the extent afforded by Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , _however_ , that
if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL,
such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 1.4(b)(i)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such
Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares (or written threats thereof), any written withdrawal or purported
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law
that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and Legal

 



3 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, or approve the withdrawal of, any such demands or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

(c) _Stock Awards of the Company_.

 

(i) _Stock Options_. Except as provided in this _Section 1.4(c)(i)_ no
outstanding Company Options (whether vested or unvested) shall be assumed,
continued or substituted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Company Option
with an applicable exercise price per Share that is equal to or exceeds
the Merger Consideration shall be immediately cancelled at the Effective Time
without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
The Company agrees to cause the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate
the provisions of this _Section 1.4(c)(i)_. The cancellation or substitution,
as applicable, of a Company Option as provided in this _Section 1.4(c)(i)_
shall be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full of, any and all
rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such Company Option.

(A)  _Vested Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Vested Company
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Share of
such Vested Company Option, multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares
issuable upon the exercise in full of such Vested Company Option (the "
_Vested Option Consideration_ "). As soon as practicable (and in no event more
than thirty calendar days) following the Closing, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of a Vested Company Option the
Vested Option Consideration (if any), less applicable Taxes.

 

(B) _Unvested Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Share of such Unvested Company
Option, multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares issuable upon the
exercise in full of such Unvested Company Option (the " _Unvested Option
Consideration_ "), with payment of such Unvested Option Consideration,
less applicable Taxes, to be made in accordance with the vesting schedule
applicable to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that such holder remains employed by or otherwise in
service to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries
on each applicable vesting date, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Unvested Payment Plan.

 

(ii) _Restricted Stock Units_. Except as provided in this _Section
1.4(c)(ii)_ no outstanding Restricted Stock Units shall be assumed, continued
or substituted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. The Company agrees to
cause the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to adopt any resolutions and
take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this 
_Section 1.4(c)(ii)_. The cancellation or assumption, as applicable, of an
award of Restricted Stock Units as provided in this _Section 1.4(c)(ii)_
shall be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full of, any and all
rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such award of Restricted
Stock Units.

(A) At the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit held by an individual
who is an active employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be assumed and converted into an Alphabet Stock Unit to acquire
Alphabet Common Stock in respect of that number of shares of Alphabet Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Restricted Stock
Unit multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. Each Alphabet Stock
Unit so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall continue to be
subject to, the same terms and conditions

 



4 ##### Table of Contents

  

 as applied to the Restricted Stock Unit prior to the Effective Time (but,
taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the Company Equity
Incentive Plans or in the underlying award agreement by reason of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby).

(B) At the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit held by an individual
who is a former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than an individual described in _Section
1.4(c)(ii)(C)(y)_) which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the
Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares subject to
such award of Restricted Stock Units (the " _Restricted Stock Unit
Consideration_ "). As soon as practicable (and in no event more than thirty
calendar days) following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each holder of Restricted Stock Units the Restricted
Stock Unit Consideration, less any applicable Taxes.

 

(C) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit held
by (x) a Person other than an individual described in  _Section
1.4(c)(ii)(A)_ or _Section 1.4(c)(ii)(B)_ (y) any non-employee member of the
Company Board or any consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
its Subsidiaries which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall vest and be settled in shares of Company Common Stock and each such
share of Company Common Stock shall be treated in accordance with _Section
1.4(b)_ hereof.

 

(iii) Not later than the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders
of Unvested Company Options and those Restricted Stock Units subject to

cause the Final Purchase Period, to the extent that it would otherwise be
outstanding at the Effective Time, to be terminated no later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (B) make

Period, but otherwise treat the Final Purchase Period as a fully effective and
completed Purchase Period for all purposes pursuant to the Company ESPP; and
(C) cause the exercise (as of no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to

with an applicable exercise price per Share that is less than the Merger
Consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, such
number of Shares as calculated in accordance with Section 1.2 and Section 1.6

this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
any Warrant with an applicable exercise price per Share that is equal to or

Effective Time without any cash payment or other consideration being made in
respect thereof. The Company agrees to cause the Company Board (or a committee

written notice, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, to each holder of a
Warrant, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Warrant, informing
such holders of the effect of the Merger on the Warrant. The Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such
notice prior to delivery of such notice to the holders of the Warrant. The
cancellation or substitution, as applicable, of a Warrant as provided in this
_Section 1.4(d)_ shall be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full
of, any and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such
Warrant.

 Section 1.5 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent

 multiplying (x) the Merger Consideration by (y) the aggregate number of
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (such cash amount being
referred to herein as the " _Payment Fund_ "). From time to time following the
Effective Time as required, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent additional cash in any
amount necessary to enable the Payment Agent to pay any and all Merger
Consideration payable hereunder. Any net profit resulting from, or interest
produced by, such deposits shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose other than to fund
payments pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, except as set forth in this
Agreement.

 

(ii) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Shares on the date that is six
(6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore exchanged
their Shares for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 1.4_(b) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws), as general
creditors thereof, for any payment of and claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration (without interest thereon) to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Payment Agent pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)_ to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall
be delivered to Parent promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days) of Parents demand to the Payment Agent therefore; _provided_ that in
such case, until six (6) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the Payment Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid

loses appraisal rights as set forth in this Agreement.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.4(b)(i)_: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of a certificate or certificates (the "
_Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in  _Section
2.2(d)_) or transfer of Uncertificated Shares (excluding Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) to the Payment Agent (as evidenced by receipt by the
Payment Agent of an "agents message" in customary form or such other
evidence as the Payment Agent may reasonably request); and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_. Each holder of
Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Shares represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share (x) in the
case of Shares represented by a Certificate, upon surrender to the Payment
Agent of such Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested
by the Payment Agent or (y) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares promptly following the Closing. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, from and after the Effective Time each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent for all purposes only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of _Article I_. If Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in  _Article
I_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. From and
after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent (or
if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section
2.2(b)(ii)_, Parent) shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Payment Agent or Parent, as the case
may be) of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration issuable
in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section 1.4(b)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Payment Agent may, in their
respective discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver
a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Payment
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

(e) _Transferred Shares_. If a transfer of ownership of Shares is not
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered in the stockholder books or ledger of the
Company, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred
(in each case, accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the
Payment Agent or Parent) and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Payment Agent or Parent any transfer or other similar Tax required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Payment Agent or Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(f) _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under Applicable Law. To the extent that such amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 

(g) _No Liability_. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Shares
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent
the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction
outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of the certificate of incorporation (the " _Charter_ ") and bylaws (the "
_Bylaws_ "), as amended to date, of the Company. The Charter and Bylaws are in
full force and effect on the date of this Agreement. The Company is not in
violation of its Charter or Bylaws. 

Section 3.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and, subject in the case of the Merger to obtaining the

hereby and to perform its covenants and other obligations hereunder. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by
the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(collectively, the " _Enforceability Limitations_ ").

 

(c) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company Board unanimously (as among the members of the Company

contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement.

 

(e) The Company Board has received the written opinion (or an oral opinion
confirmed in writing) of its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC,
substantially to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based
upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth
therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Common
Stock (other than Excluded Shares) in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement is
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. As of the date of this

Company of this Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and the compliance by the Company
with any of the provisions hereof do not and will not (i) violate or conflict
with any provision of the Charter or Bylaws or other constituent documents of

individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the time periods

(iii) Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this
Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and
matters required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Companys
stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at
the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(iv) The Company shall solicit from Company Stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, and unless the
Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder
Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall cooperate with
and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its
solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination of the
definitive Proxy Statement. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to _Article IX_, the Company shall establish a record date for,
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting for the
purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with
Delaware Law, whether or not the Company Board at any time subsequent to the
date hereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or

or recommends that the Company Stockholders reject it.

(i) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 7.1(c)_, (A) the Company Board
shall (x) recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement in

recommending against (and reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation) any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction that is a tender offer or
exchange offer within 10 Business Days after the commencement thereof (the
actions or inactions referred to in the preceding clauses (1) through (4)
being referred to herein as a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval the Company
Board may (x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in respect of an
Acquisition Transaction that the Company Board has determined is a Superior
Proposal or (y) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(f)_ to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, subject, in the case of the preceding clause (y), to the
prior or concurrent payment of the Company Termination Fee, only if:

 

(A) the Company Board has received a bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not
result from a breach (or deemed breach) of _Section 6.1(a)_ or _Section
6.2_;

(B) The Company Board (1) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (2) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law
(which determinations and any public announcement thereof shall not constitute
a Company Board Recommendation Change unless and until such party shall
have failed at or prior to one Business Day following the end of the period
referred to in (C) and, if applicable, (E), below (and upon the occurrence of
such failure, such determination and such public announcement shall constitute
a Company Board Recommendation Change) to publicly announce that it (x) was
recommending that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement and approve
the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) has 

 



36 ##### Table of Contents

  

 determined that such Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal and has
publicly rejected such Acquisition Proposal (taking into account in (x) any
modifications or adjustments made to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and agreed to by the parties hereto and in (y) any
modifications or adjustments made to such Acquisition Proposal));

 

(C) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination
of this Agreement, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least four
(4) Business Days notice of its intention to effect such action pursuant to
this _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ (the " _Notice Period_ ") (which notice shall
include the most current version of the proposed definitive agreement and, to
the extent not included therein, all material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal);

 

(D) if requested by Parent, during the Notice Period, the Company shall have
met and negotiated in good faith with Parent regarding modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases
to be a Superior Proposal;

(E) prior to the end of the Notice Period, Parent shall not have made a
counter-offer or proposal in writing and in a manner that, if accepted by the
Company, would form a binding contract, that the Company Board determines
(after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel)
is at least as favorable to the Company Stockholders as such Superior Proposal
(it being understood that (x) any material revision to the terms of a Superior
Proposal, including, any revision in price, shall require a new notice
pursuant to clause (C) above, except such new Notice Period shall be three (3)
Business Days, (y) the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to the
extent necessary to ensure that at least three (3) Business Days remain in
the Notice Period subsequent to each time the Company notifies Parent of any
such material revision and (z) there may be multiple extensions of the Notice
Period); and

 

(F) the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and after considering any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent
pursuant to clause (E) above), that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the
failure to either (i) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or (ii)
terminate this Agreement and enter into the Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company
may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other than pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, in response to an Intervening Event if the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law only if:

 

(A) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4)
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board has (A) made a
determination pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_; and (B) resolved to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section
7.1(c)(iii)_, which notice will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable
detail; and

(B) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
and its Representatives, during such four (4) Business Day period, have if
requested by Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Company Board no longer determines in good faith that
the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
Applicable Law;.

 

(iv) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (A)
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule

 Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with Applicable Law (including fiduciary duties);
_provided_ , _however_ , that any statement(s) made by the Company Board
pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and any Company Board Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance
with _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_; _provided_ , _further_ ,
for the avoidance of doubt, that it shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for the Company Board to make a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d9-f or any similar communication. For the
avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto (in which the Company indicates that it has not
changed the Company Board Recommendation) shall not, in and of itself, be
deemed a Company Board Recommendation Change; it being understood that any
disclosure contemplated by the foregoing relating to an Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change unless the Company
Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall file or cause to be
filed with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and

this Agreement (as well as a reasonable advance opportunity to review and
comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection
with, any such written communications), and (e) to the extent practicable,
(A) give the other party reasonable advance notice of all oral communications
with any Governmental Authority in the U.S. or any Relevant Antitrust
Jurisdictions regarding the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (B) with respect to any oral communication, a reasonable
opportunity to participate in such discussions, and, to the extent a party
hereto does not participate in such discussions, the party having
such discussions shall promptly provide such non-participating party with a
summary of such discussions. If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives
a request for additional information or documentary material from any such
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall use reasonable best
efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other party, which shall include providing the
other party with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon,
and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any such
written materials, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

therein shall be given only to outside counsel and previously-agreed outside
economic consultants of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel or outside

is not prohibited from complying with Applicable Law), subject to the

consultations with the Company in advance of any decisions about
communications and strategy in connection with the Antitrust Laws and
litigation matters relating thereto, and the inclusion of the Company at
meetings with Governmental Authorities involving substantive issues under
Antitrust Laws, unless (but subject to the foregoing notification and good
faith consultation provisions) the inclusion of the Company is reasonably
determined by Parent in good faith to be strategically detrimental to the
ultimate goal of obtaining clearance of the Merger under the Antitrust Laws.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
not be required to agree (and the Company shall neither agree nor permit any
of its Subsidiaries to agree without the prior written consent of Parent (and
the Company shall, if Parent so directs, agree, so long as such agreement is
conditioned upon Closing)) to (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition of any of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest,
assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of
Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on
the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, (B) the

agreement to any modifications of existing contracts or entry into new
contracts (other than the payment of customary filing and application fees)
in connection with obtaining any waivers, consents, approvals from
Governmental Authorities under the Antitrust Laws of any Relevant Antitrust
Jurisdiction, or (D) the imposition of any impediment on Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under any
Antitrust Laws of any Relevant Antitrust Jurisdiction (clauses (A), (B), (C)
and (D), collectively, " _Remedies_ "); _provided_ , that Parent shall agree
to the divestiture of assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
are immaterial to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, solely
to the extent necessary both to (1) obtain clearances under the Antitrust
Laws, or to remove any court or regulatory orders under the Antitrust Laws,
that in each case are impeding the ability to consummate the Merger by the
Termination Date (as the same may be extended) and (2) permit the Closing to
occur by the Termination Date (as the same may be extended), provided, that
any such divestiture would be conditioned upon the Closing. Nothing herein
shall require Parent (or permit the Company without the prior written consent
of Parent) to litigate with any Governmental Authority.

Agreement, including _Section 7.2_ with respect to matters related to the

this _Section 7.3_ but subject to _Section 7.2_ with respect to matters
related to the Antitrust Laws and clearances and litigation thereunder,
neither

Parent) the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other
consideration (including increased or accelerated payments), the provision of
additional security (including a guaranty), or the relinquishment of any right
or any modifications of existing Contracts or entry into new Contracts in

documents or information to the extent that in the reasonable judgment of the
Company and its outside legal counsel (a) any Applicable Law requires the
Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or
information; (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a
material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other privilege applicable to such documents or information; or (c) access
to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third
Person the right to terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such
Contract _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances
in which the restrictions of this clause would apply, which efforts shall
include, if such access or disclosure (x) is prohibited by Applicable Law,
using reasonable best efforts to provide such access or disclosure in a manner
that does not violate Applicable Law, (y) would result in a loss of such
privilege, using its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure (or as much or it as possible) in a manner that would not result in
a loss of such privilege, including to the extent requested by Parent and if
applicable, by entering into a customary joint defense agreement that would
alleviate such loss of privilege or (z) is prohibited by an existing Contract,

use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure and/or
access arrangements. Subject to Applicable Law, the Company will provide
Parent with any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information
of the Company reasonably requested by Parent. Any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 7.4_ will be conducted
in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any
access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject
to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and
will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and

obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with

indirectly to (x) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such
Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of
whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior
to, at or after the Effective Time), or (y) any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person
delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification
under this _Section 7.10(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall
survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time
(it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof,
the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have agreed to not assert that
the Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification hereunder with
respect to such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry), (ii) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Person for
any legal expenses of other counsel subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Person in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for such
Indemnified Person advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and such Indemnified
Person, such Indemnified Person may retain counsel satisfactory to them and
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall pay all reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such counsel for
such Indemnified Person promptly as statements therefor are received upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay
such amount or any other amount paid on behalf of such Indemnified Person if
it is ultimately determined in accordance with clause (B) of the following
sentence that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated pursuant to this clause (ii) to pay for only one firm of counsel for
all Indemnified Persons in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for
such Indemnified Persons would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest, provided that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid
conflicts of interest shall be used; (iii) the Indemnified Persons will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter at Parents or the Surviving
Corporations expense; and (iv) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be liable for any settlement effected without its express written consent
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this _Section 7.10(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
(A) neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including
Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified
Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry or such Indemnified Persons otherwise consent and
(B) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Person if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified
Person in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by Applicable Law and
any and all amounts previously paid on behalf of such Indemnified Person
shall be repaid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person.

(c) _Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO
Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are on
substantially similar terms and

 



43 ##### Table of Contents

  

 conditions to those of the DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
satisfying its obligations under this _Section 7.10(c)_, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two
hundred fifty percent (250%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage
for its last full fiscal year (such two hundred fifty percent (250%) amount,
the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium,
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with, in the
good faith determination of the Surviving Corporation, the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the
Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Company, following reasonable consultation with Parent, shall
have the right to (and if Parent requests, the Company shall) purchase a six-
year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in no event shall the Company pay, or the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay, an aggregate premium for such "tail" policy in excess of the
Maximum Annual Premium. In the event that the Company elects to purchase such
a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, in which case, the Surviving Corporation (and Parent)
shall have no further obligations under the first sentence of this _Section
7.10(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) or any
of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation (or Parent) set forth in this _Section 7.10_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation or its successor shall be subject to any
limitation imposed by Applicable Law (including any limitation on the
Companys ability to indemnify its own directors and officers) and (ii) Parent
shall have no obligation to maintain the existence of the
Surviving Corporation for any specified period following the Effective Time.

(f) _No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. The obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.10_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person
who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 7.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior
written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 7.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the
Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 7.10_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 7.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section
7.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
that such persons may have under the Charter, Bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable law (whether at
law or in equity).

(g) _Preservation of Other Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of
their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood
and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.10_ is
not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

prohibit the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable, from amending or
terminating any such Employee Plans, or other compensation or benefits plans,

year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and

welfare benefits that are (x) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately

New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, and (y) shall allow any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit

maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(e)  _Company 401(k) Plans_. The Company Board shall adopt resolutions

qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Company
401(k) Plans_ ") shall be terminated, as of the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date (but conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing). The Company
and Parent shall cooperate in good faith prior to the Closing with respect to
the preparation and execution of all documentation necessary to effect the
foregoing termination, and the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all such documentation. To the extent
that the Company 401(k) Plans are terminated pursuant to Parents request,

(g) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this  _Section 7.11_ will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii)
subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this
_Section 7.11_, require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their

Voting Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Voting Agreement, and (c) if the restrictions of Section 203
of the DGCL or any other Takeover Statute become applicable to this Agreement,
the Voting Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Voting Agreement, to take all action necessary to ensure that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this

set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_ or in  _Section 8.1(c)_ (solely with respect

termination of any waiting period and any extension thereof under the HSR
Act) from a Governmental Authority pursuant to Antitrust Laws or (B) any
action (including the enacting, issuing, entry or promulgation of Orders or
