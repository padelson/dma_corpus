III  CONVERSION OF SHARES   Section 3.1 Conversion of Shares.   (a) At
the Effective Time, each share of the Company\'s common stock, ascribed value
$1.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company
or the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive from Parent
$24.75 in cash (the "Merger Consideration") without any interest thereon.  
(b) Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent or
Sub, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common
stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (c) All
shares of Common Stock that are owned by Parent, Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall, at the Effective Time, be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.    10     (d) At the Effective Time,
each share of Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall
be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and the
holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of such shares of outstanding
Common Stock not represented by certificates ("Book-Entry Shares") and the
holders of certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented shares of outstanding Common Stock (the "Certificates") shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock other
than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates in accordance with Section 3.2, the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, for each such share of Common Stock held by
them.   (e) Without in any way limiting the covenants in Section 6.1, if at
any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time any change
in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall occur as a result
of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any
stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period,
the amount of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a) shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change. In addition, the Merger
Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (i) the aggregate amount of all dividends (if any) paid by the
Company pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ii) and Section 6.12(b)(v) hereof by (ii)
the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, dividends permitted
under Section 6.1(c)(i) shall not result in any reduction of the Merger
Consideration.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (but without in any way limiting the covenants in Section
6.1), the consummation of the Merger shall not affect the Surviving
Corporation\'s obligation to pay all dividends and other distributions on the
Common Stock that are authorized with a record date prior to and remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the
occurrence of the Effective Time, neither the Merger nor anything in this
Agreement shall affect the right of any Person to receive dividends or other
distributions on the Common Stock authorized with a record date prior to and
remaining unpaid at the Effective Time.   Section 3.2 Exchange of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.   (a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent
shall deliver or cause to be delivered, in trust, to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common
Stock at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the "Consideration Fund") to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.2 in respect
of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, assuming no Dissenting Shares. In the
event the Consideration Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration contemplated by Section 3.1, Parent shall promptly
deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds to the Paying Agent in an
amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such
payments.   (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares whose shares were    11    converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1 (i) a letter of transmittal that
shall specify that delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery
of an "agent\'s message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration, the form and substance of which letter of transmittal
and instructions shall be substantially as reasonably agreed to by the
Company and Parent and prepared prior to the Closing. Upon surrender of a
Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other documents as
may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book-Entry
Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the Book-Entry Share or
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than a Person in whose name the Book-Entry Share or Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Book-Entry Share or Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, which shall have been
cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c), and other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III, without any
interest thereon, and any declared and unpaid dividends to which the holder
of such Certificate is entitled.   (c) The Consideration Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation; provided, however, that any such investments shall be in (i)
securities issued or directly and fully guaranteed or insured by the United
States government or any agency or instrumentality thereof and having
maturities of not more than one month from the date of investment or (ii)
money market mutual or similar funds having assets in excess of
$1,000,000,000. Earnings on the Consideration Fund shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No investment of
the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent from making the payments required by this Article III, and
following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund.   
12     (d) The Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Common
Stock upon the surrender for exchange of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common
Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates. At
and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III, except
as otherwise provided by Law.   (e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the former shareholders of the Company one (1) year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry shares that evidenced
ownership of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
Any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article III with respect to such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.   (f)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto
shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have
been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in
respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied with this
Article III with respect thereto shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.   (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall
be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and,
if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to
which such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to
this Article III.   (h) Subject to Section 6.12(a), Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration or other amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of shares of Common Stock
such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
the    13    case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of
the shares of Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be.   Section 3.3 Shares of Dissenting Shareholders.   (a)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement other than Section 3.3(b) to the
contrary, any shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a shareholder who is
entitled to dissent from the Merger under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and who
has exercised, when and in the manner required by Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA
to the extent so required prior to the Effective Time, such right to dissent
and to obtain payment of the fair value of such shares under Chapter 23B.13
of the WBCA in connection with the Merger ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until
such shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such shareholder\'s right to obtain payment of the fair
value of such shareholder\'s Dissenting Shares under Chapter 23B.13 of the
WBCA, but shall instead be entitled only to such rights with respect to such
Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such shareholder under Chapter 23B.13
of the WBCA. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares shall not
be entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of
dividends or other distributions (except dividends or other distributions
payable to shareholders of record prior to the Effective Time), and holders
of Dissenting Shares shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares, except those provided
under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA.   (b) If any shareholder who holds
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect
or otherwise) such shareholder\'s right to obtain payment of the fair value
of such shareholder\'s Dissenting Shares under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such
effective withdrawal or loss, such shareholder\'s shares of Common Stock
shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and, if the occurrence of such effective
withdrawal or loss is later than the Effective Time, shall be treated as if
they had as of the Effective Time been converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, as set forth in
subsection (a) of Section 3.1 or converted or cancelled in accordance with
subsections (b) or (c) of Section 3.1, as applicable.   (c) The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notices of intent to demand
payment for any shares of Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands
for payment and any other instruments served pursuant to the WBCA and
received by the Company relating to the exercise of dissenters\' rights under
Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to the Effective Time
with respect to the exercise of dissenters\' rights under the WBCA. Except
with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily
make any    14    payment with respect to the exercise of dissenters\'
rights or settle or offer to settle any demands for payment with respect to
Dissenting Shares.    ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

(without giving effect to clause (A) of the definition of such term), and, in
the case of clause (iv), for such filings, registrations, notifications,
authorizations, consents or approvals the failure of which to make or obtain

Company has filed all reports and other documents with the SEC required to be

which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate is party, whether written or oral,
for the benefit of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
other than any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of section 3(37) of
ERISA) (the "Benefit Plans"). The Company has made available to Parent a true
and complete    18    copy of each Benefit Plan and all amendments
thereto (or in the case of any Benefit Plan that is not in writing, a written
description thereof).   (b) Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, each Benefit Plan is now and has been operated in accordance with

terminate any Benefit Plan and, to the knowledge of the Company, no condition
exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings will be

unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, any
Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), and, as of the date
hereof, no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced with respect to any
such material claim, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (f) The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee,
officer, or director of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay,

the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, by or before any Governmental Entity, except such
actions, claims, suits, proceedings, governmental or regulatory
investigations, injunctions, orders, judgments, rulings or decree that

its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Laws, in each case, applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets

the aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 4.10 shall not apply to
employee benefit plans, Permits, Taxes, Environmental Laws or labor matters,
which, solely with respect to compliance with Laws, are the subject
exclusively of the representations and warranties in Section 4.8, Section
4.11, Section 4.12, Section 4.15 and Section 4.16, respectively.   Section
4.11 Permits. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold all licenses,
franchises, permits, certificates, approvals and authorizations from
Governmental Entities, or required by Governmental Entities to be obtained,
in each case, necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses

hold or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance
with the terms and conditions of all Permits, except such non-compliance that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 4.12 Taxes.   (a) Each of the Company and its

Taxes that are being contested in good faith.   (f) The Company (i) has,
since January 1, 2006, been organized and operated, and intends to continue
to operate, in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification
and taxation as a REIT and (ii) has not taken any action or omitted to take
any    20    action that would reasonably be expected to result in a
successful challenge by the United States Internal Revenue Service to the
Company\'s ability to elect to be a REIT for the fiscal year ending December
31, 2006.   (g) No Subsidiary of the Company, excluding any Subsidiary in
which the Company holds 10% or less by both vote and value, within the
meaning of section 856(c)(4)(B)(iii) of the Code, is a corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation that qualifies as a
"qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of section 856(i)(2) of the
Code or as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of section 856(l)
of the Code. Each Subsidiary of the Company that is a partnership, joint
venture or limited liability company and which has not elected to be
a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of section 856(l) of the Code
(i) has been since January 1, 2006 treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity and not as a corporation or
an association taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not since the latest of
January 1, 2006, its formation or the acquisition by the Company of a direct
or indirect interest therein owned any assets (including securities) that
have caused the Company to violate section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for material
Taxes under sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code that has not been
previously paid. To the knowledge of the Company, (A) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries (other than a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the
meaning of section 856(l) of the Code or any subsidiary of a "taxable REIT
subsidiary") has engaged at any time in any "prohibited transaction" within
the meaning of section 857(b)(6) of the Code and (B) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any transaction that would give rise
to "redetermined rents, redetermined deductions, and excess interest"
described in section 857(b)(7) of the Code.   (h) All material amounts of
Taxes required to be withheld by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have been timely withheld, to the extent required by applicable Law, and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of an affiliated group filing
a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common
parent of which was the Company) or has any liability for the Taxes of any
Person (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law) or as a transferee or successor, (ii) has engaged in any "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section
1.6011-4(b)(2), (iii) has requested any extension of time within which to
file any material Tax Return that has not yet been filed or (iv) has
requested a private letter ruling from the IRS or comparable rulings from
other Governmental Entities. To the knowledge of the Company, no power of
attorney with respect to any Tax matter is currently in force with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, no
unresolved claim has been made in writing by a Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax
Returns that the Company or any such Subsidiary is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction.   Section 4.13 Tangible Assets. Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, the Company and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries have valid title
to, or valid leasehold or sublease interests or other comparable contract
rights in or relating to, all of the real properties and other tangible
assets (including    21    timber) necessary for the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as currently
conducted.   Section 4.14 Intellectual Property. Except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company and its Subsidiaries own,
or possess necessary or required licenses or other necessary or required
rights to use in the manner currently used, all items of intellectual
property that are necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as currently conducted. Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, there is no claim pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of any intellectual property rights of any third
party, and, to the knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as currently conducted,
does not violate any intellectual property rights of any third party.

is, and has, since October 31, 2005, been, in compliance with all
Environmental Laws, which compliance includes the possession by the Company
and its Subsidiaries of Permits required for their current operations under
applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance with the terms and conditions
thereof, except for such failures to be in compliance as would not be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.   (b)
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
of any Environmental Claims against the Company or any Subsidiary that would,
if the Company or any such Subsidiary were found to be liable, individually
or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole.   (c) To the knowledge of the Company, with respect to the real
property currently owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, there have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials that would

Adverse Effect.   Section 4.16 Labor Matters.   (a) There are no pending

labor organization. As of the date hereof and to the knowledge of the
Company, there are no labor organizational campaigns,   
22    representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking
a representation proceeding with respect to any of the employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (c) As of the date hereof, there is
no unfair labor practice, labor arbitration or grievance proceeding pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or its
Subsidiaries, except for any such proceeding that would not, individually or

whole.   (d) Except as would not be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is

practice that is now pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened

its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.   (e) The Company has made available to
Parent complete and accurate copies of all employment manuals and policies
covering employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries.   Section 4.17 Proxy

the Company in connection with the Merger (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) will not, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed

Section 4.20 Rights Agreement. The Company has taken all actions necessary

such insurance). There is no claim by the Company or its Subsidiaries pending
under any the Insurance Policies that (i) has been denied or disputed by the
insurer and (ii) would be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. All Insurance Policies are in full force and effect, all premiums
due and payable thereon have been paid, and no written notice of cancellation

and, in the case of clause (iv), for such filings, registrations,
notifications, authorizations, consents or approvals the failure of which to
make or obtain, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.4 Operations

6.1, nothing in this Section 6.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall forbid
the Company from taking, or omitting to take, as the case may be, any and
all actions that, in the Company\'s reasonable judgment, are necessary for
the Company to be able to elect to be taxed as a REIT for United States
federal or applicable state income tax purposes for all fiscal years
beginning with the fiscal year ending    31    December 31, 2006;
provided, however, that the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable
notice of any such action if such action would violate the covenants set
forth herein but for this paragraph; provided further that the Company shall
provide such notice prior to taking or omitting to take such action, to the
extent that such prior notice is commercially practicable.   Section 6.2
Access to Information; Financing.   (a) The Company shall (and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent and directors, officers,
employees, counsel, investment bankers, financial advisors and sources,
accountants, agents and other authorized representatives ("Representatives")
of Parent reasonable access, in a manner not disruptive to the operations of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to the properties, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such Representatives all information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any
information to Parent or Sub if such disclosure would, in the reasonable
judgment of the Company, (i) cause significant competitive harm to the
Company or its Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated, (ii) violate applicable Law or the provisions
of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or (iii) jeopardize any attorney-client, work-product or other legal
privilege (it being understood that the parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not
result in a loss of any such privilege); provided further, however, that,
nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake any
environmental investigations or sampling at any of the properties owned,
operated or leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries. Parent agrees that it
will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information
obtained pursuant to this Section 6.2 for any competitive or other purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to this Agreement. The confidentiality agreement, dated
September 20, 2006 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between the Company and
Parent shall apply with respect to information furnished by the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Company\'s officers, employees and other Representatives
hereunder.   (b) In addition, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, at Parent\'s sole expense, reasonably cooperate
in connection with the arrangement of any financing as may be
reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries), including, at the reasonable request of Parent, by
agreeing to pledge, grant security interests in, and otherwise grant liens
on, the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' assets; provided that no such pledge
or grant shall be effective until the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with any financing
arrangements of Parent prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall (x) furnish
to the Company complete, correct and executed copies of any financing
agreements promptly upon their execution and (y) otherwise keep the   
32    Company reasonably informed of the status of Parent\'s and Sub\'s
efforts to arrange any financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree that
Parent\'s and Sub\'s obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner
upon Parent\'s or Sub\'s obtaining any financing. The failure, for any
reason, of Parent and Sub to have sufficient cash available on the Closing
Date to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with Article III
and/or the failure of Parent to deliver sufficient funds to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration on the Closing Date shall constitute a willful and
material breach of this Agreement. Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges and
agrees that the Company and its Affiliates and employees of the Company and
its Affiliates have no responsibility for any financing that Parent or Sub
may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Any
offering memorandum, banker\'s book or other materials prepared by or on
behalf of Parent or Sub or any of their Affiliates, or Parent\'s or Sub\'s
financing sources, in connection with Parent\'s or Sub\'s financing
activities in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, "Offering Materials") which include any information provided
by or on behalf of the Company and its Affiliates shall include a conspicuous
disclaimer to the effect that the Company and its Affiliates and employees of
the Company and its Affiliates have no responsibility for the content of such
Offering Materials and disclaim all responsibility therefor and shall further
include a disclaimer with respect to the Company and its Affiliates and
employees of the Company and its Affiliates in any oral disclosure with
respect to such financing activities.   Section 6.3 Acquisition
Proposals.   (a) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, (x) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and (y) promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days after the date hereof) request
the prompt return from all such Persons or cause the destruction of all
copies of confidential information previously provided to such parties by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives and shall deny
access to any virtual data room containing any such information to any party
(other than Parent and its Representatives). The Company and its Subsidiaries
will not, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries will not authorize or
knowingly permit any of their respective Representatives to, (i) initiate,
solicit, cause, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage, directly or
indirectly (including by way of furnishing information), the making of any
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) except as permitted by Section 6.3(b), engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information or data to, any
Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal.   (b) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval), if the board of directors of the Company receives a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof in circumstances not
involving a breach of Section 6.3(a), the Company and its board of directors
may, after providing Parent not less than 24 hours notice of its intention to
take such actions, participate in    33    discussions or negotiations
(including, as a part thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish
any information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to, any
Person or Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and their respective
Representatives and sources of financing (but only after such Person or
Persons enter into a customary confidentiality agreement with the Company
(which confidentiality agreement must be no less restrictive in the aggregate
to the Person making such proposal than the Confidentiality Agreement);
provided that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not provide for an
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the
Company from complying with this Section 6.3 and (2) the Company,
concurrently with its delivery to such Person (in the case of
written information) or promptly (in the case of information delivered
orally), delivers to Parent all such information that is material, non-public
and not previously provided to Parent), if the Company\'s board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and (in
the case of the following clause (i) only) its financial advisor, by
resolution duly adopted, (i) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) that the failure to
participate in such discussions or negotiations or to furnish such
information would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors\' fiduciary duties (including the standards of conduct set forth in
Section 23B.08.300 of the WBCA) under applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, if the board of directors of the Company
receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made after
the date hereof in circumstances not involving a breach of Section 6.3(a)
which contains a statement or terms that are not reasonably understandable or
clear on their face, the Company and its board of directors may submit
written questions or requests for clarification to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal that are restricted exclusively to seeking clarification
of such statement or terms so as to determine whether such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal;
provided that both such Acquisition Proposal and such written request for
clarification have been provided concurrently to Parent with the delivery of
such written request to such party. The Company shall not agree to waive,
amend or modify (excluding course of conduct) or terminate any standstill or
similar agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or by which any of them is bound (in each case, other than any such agreement
with Parent). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
action taken by Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on
behalf of the Company or any such Subsidiary that would be a violation of the
restrictions set forth in Section 6.3 if taken by the Company shall be deemed
to be a breach of Section 6.3 by the Company. The Company shall provide
Parent with a correct and complete copy of any confidentiality agreement
entered into pursuant to this paragraph within 24 hours after the execution
thereof.   (c) The Company will promptly notify Parent (within 24 hours) of
the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and shall, in any such notice to
Parent, indicate the identity of the Person (and, if such Person does not
have a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act,
its equity investors, if the Company has knowledge thereof) making such
proposal and the material terms and conditions of such proposal, shall
include with such notice a copy of such proposal, and thereafter
shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of all material
developments affecting the status and terms of such proposal (and the Company
shall provide Parent promptly (within 24 hours) with copies of any additional
written materials received that relate to such proposal).    34    
(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.3(d), neither the board
of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement or the recommendation by such board of
directors or committee that shareholders of the Company approve this
Agreement or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (C) in the event of a tender offer or
exchange offer for any outstanding shares of Common Stock, fail to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company\'s
shareholders within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement thereof (for
the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by
the board of directors of the Company in respect of the acceptance of any
tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders shall constitute a failure
to recommend against any such offer) (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause
or authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter
of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger,
acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement related
to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in
accordance with Section 6.3(b)) (each a "Company Acquisition Agreement").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval and subject to this Section 6.3(d), the board of
directors of the Company may (x) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to an Intervening Event or (y) in response to an Acquisition
Proposal made after the date hereof and not otherwise resulting from a breach
of this Section 6.3 that the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial
advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal (1) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (2) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
and concurrently with such termination enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement, subject to satisfaction of its obligations under Section 8.2(b);
provided, however, that the board of directors of the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to clause (y) of this Section 6.3(d) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) until immediately after the third
Business Day following Parent\'s receipt of written notice (a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Notice") from the Company advising Parent that the
board of directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying
the reasons therefor, including a description of the material terms of the
Superior Proposal that is the basis for the proposed action of the board of
directors of the Company (it being understood and agreed that, in the event
of an amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of
such Superior Proposal, the board of directors of the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise such right pursuant to such clause (y) based on such
Superior Proposal, as so amended, until immediately after the third Business
Day following Parent\'s receipt of a Company Adverse Recommendation Notice
with respect to such Superior Proposal as so amended). In connection with
any Company Adverse Recommendation Notice pursuant to clause (y), the
Company agrees that, until immediately after the third Business Day following
Parent\'s receipt of such Company Adverse Recommendation Notice, the Company
and its Representatives shall (if Parent so requests) negotiate in good faith
with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. In
determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, the   
35    board of directors of the Company shall take into account any
amendment to this Agreement entered into, or to which Parent irrevocably
covenants to enter into, and for which all internal approvals of Parent have
been obtained, since receipt of the applicable Company Adverse Recommendation
Notice, and prior to making such change, the board of directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith, after considering the results of
any such negotiations and any revised proposals made by Parent, that the
Superior Proposal giving rise to such notice continues to be a Superior
Proposal. Neither making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with this Section 6.3(d) nor terminating this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.1(c)(ii) shall constitute a breach by the Company
of this Agreement. In addition, nothing herein shall restrict the Company or
its board of directors from complying with its disclosure obligations with
regard to any Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" announcement in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal.   Section 6.4 Employee Benefits.   (a) With respect to employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are not covered by a collective
bargaining agreement listed on Section 4.16(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or any replacements, renewals or extensions of such collective
bargaining agreements (the "Non-CB Employees"), for a period of no less than
(1) year following the Effective Time or for so long as the employee remains
employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, if less than such period, Parent
agrees to (i) provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each Non-
CB Employee with base salary or wage rates, incentive compensation
opportunity and other cash compensation that, in the aggregate, are not less
than those in effect for such Non-CB Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
employee benefits (including retirement benefits) to each Non-CB Employee
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the employee benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.  
(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be honored, in
accordance with their terms, all written incentive, bonus, individual
benefit, employment, employment termination, severance and other compensation
agreements, plans and arrangements, including the Company\'s executive
change-in-control policy and general severance and retention plans, in each
case existing immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, that are
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former
officer, director or employee thereof or for the benefit of any such current
or former officer, director or employee, listed in Section 6.4(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "CIC Plans"). Parent
shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, terminate the
CIC Plans or amend them in any manner without the consent of the affected
current or former officer, director or employee for a period of no less than
one (1) year immediately following the Effective Time. Parent hereby
guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of such
obligations assumed by Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section
6.4(b).   (c) With respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement listed on Section
4.16(b) of the Company    36    Disclosure Schedule or any
replacements, renewals or extensions of such collective bargaining agreements
(the "CB Employees" and, together with the Non-CB Employees, the
"Employees"), Parent agrees to honor or cause to be honored all such
collective bargaining agreements and provide such CB Employees with
compensation and benefits as set forth in such agreements.   (d) With
respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or arrangement
maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time and in
which any of the Employees participate (the "Parent Plans"), for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits
(including benefit accrual), service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
(or predecessor employers to the extent the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with
Parent and/or any applicable Subsidiary of Parent; provided, however, that
such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods or evidence of insurability
requirements. Each Parent Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations
to the extent waived or not applicable under the applicable Benefit Plan. The
Employees shall be given credit under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts
paid prior to the Effective Time during the year in which the Effective Time
occurs under a corresponding Benefit Plan during the same period for purposes
of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though
such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Parent Plan.   Section 6.5 Publicity. The initial press release by each
of Parent and the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement
shall be acceptable to Parent and the Company. Except with respect to any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or "stop, look and listen" announcement
made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, neither the Company nor
Parent (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press
release or make any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the
other party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement
with a national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to
issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
making any such public announcements.   Section 6.6 Directors\' and
Officers\' Insurance and Indemnification.   (a) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless the
individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or
officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified
Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection
with actions or omissions by them in their capacities as such occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by
Law. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving   
37    Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties,
unless such modification is required by Law.   (b) (i) The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time
"tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from
the Effective Time for the Indemnified Parties and any other employees,
agents or other individuals otherwise covered by the directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies
maintained by the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries prior to the date
of this Agreement (collectively, the "Insured Parties") in amount and scope
at least as favorable as the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance policies maintained by the Company and the
Company\'s Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement for matters occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) (a "Qualifying Tail Policy") or (ii) if the Company shall not
have obtained such tail policies (or the substitute policies referred to in
clause (A) below) as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to either, at its election, (x) obtain prior to and have in
effect at the Effective Time a Qualifying Tail Policy or (y) maintain in
effect for not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time the current
policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries
for the Insured Parties with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of substantially the same coverage containing terms and
conditions that are no less advantageous to the Insured Parties); provided
that (A) if the Company elects to obtain tail insurance policies pursuant to
clause (i) of this Section 6.6(b), in no event shall the Company obtain such
tail insurance policies at a cost of more than $2,250,000 in the aggregate,
and, if the aggregate cost of such tail insurance policies would exceed
$2,250,000, the Company may elect to obtain tail insurance policies for the
Insured Parties with the best coverage as shall then be available at an
aggregate premium of $2,250,000 and (B) if Parent is required to cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain insurance pursuant to clause (ii)(y) of
this Section 6.6(b), in no event shall Parent be required to expend per year
of coverage more than $1,875,000 (the "Maximum Amount") to maintain or
procure insurance coverage pursuant to clause (ii)(y) of this Section 6.6(b),
and if, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts to do so, Parent
is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by clause (ii)(y) of
this Section 6.6(b), Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as
available for the Maximum Amount.   (c) This Section 6.6 is intended to
benefit the Insured Parties and the Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Parent, Sub, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance
by the Surviving Corporation of the indemnification and other obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.6 and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.    38     (d) In the event that Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and
transferees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective
successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.6.   Section 6.7 Company Special Meeting; Proxy
Statement.   (a) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and
the Company Charter Documents, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
special meeting of the Company\'s shareholders (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the "Company Special Meeting") as soon as practicable
following the date hereof solely for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to hold the Company Special
Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section
8.1.   (b) In connection with the Company Special Meeting, the Company
shall prepare a proxy statement (as amended and supplemented from time to
time, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Merger and this Agreement and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the preliminary
Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC no later than the fifteenth Business
Day immediately following the date of this Agreement. Parent shall
promptly provide to the Company any information concerning itself and its
Affiliates required for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and shall promptly
provide such other information or assistance in the preparation thereof as
may be reasonably requested by the Company and, after consulting with Parent,
the Company shall promptly file the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond to any
comments on the Proxy Statement or requests for additional information from
the SEC as soon as practicable after receipt of any such comments or requests
and (ii) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the
Company as promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by
the SEC. The Company shall promptly (A) notify Parent upon the receipt of any
such comments or requests and (B) provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy
Statement. Prior to responding to any such comments or requests or the filing
or mailing of the Proxy Statement, the Company (x) shall provide Parent with
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of the Proxy
Statement and related correspondence and filings and (y) shall include in
such drafts, correspondence and filings all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent. Prior to the time of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, each
of the Company, Parent and Sub shall correct promptly any information
provided by it to be used specifically in the Proxy Statement that shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6.7(b), prepare and
file with the SEC such amendment or supplement as soon thereafter as is
reasonably practicable and to the extent required by applicable Law, cause
such amendment or supplement to be distributed to the shareholders of the
Company.    39     Section 6.8 Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a) Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
(i) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including satisfying all closing conditions); (ii) obtain from any
Governmental Entities any actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers,
consents, approvals, permits or orders required to be obtained by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) make all
necessary registrations and filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A)
any applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and any
applicable competition, antitrust or investment Laws of jurisdictions other
than the United States, and (C) any other applicable Law; provided, however,
that the Company and Parent will cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such
filings and attachments to outside counsel for the non-filing party; (iv)
furnish all information required for any application or other filing to be
made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v) keep the other party
informed in all respects of any material communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (vi) permit the other parties to review any communication
delivered to, and consulting with the other party in advance of any meeting
or conference with, any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with any proceeding by a
private party relating thereto, and giving the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences (to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity or private party); (vii) avoid the
entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including defending any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (viii) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No parties to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay
of the Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent
of the other parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Parent shall not, except as
may be consented to in writing by the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), directly or indirectly
through one or more of its controlled Affiliates, take any action, including
acquiring or making any investment in any corporation, partnership, limited
liability company or other business organization or any division thereof,
that would be reasonably likely to cause a material delay in the satisfaction
of the conditions contained in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 or the consummation
of the Merger. Without limiting this Section 6.8(a), Parent agrees to take,
or to cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make any and all
undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, merger control, competition, or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental    40    Entity with respect to the
Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible
(and in any event, no later than the Termination Date), including (y)
proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition
of such assets or businesses of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company
or (z) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit Parent\'s or
its Subsidiaries\' freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to
retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent (or its
Subsidiaries) or the Company, in each case, as may be required in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying
the Closing; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall be required to take any of the
actions described in clauses (y) and (z) of this Section 6.8(a) only to the
extent reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Termination Date.
The Company shall be required to take any of the actions described in clauses
(y) and (z) of this Section 6.8(a) only if requested by Parent and
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.   (b) In connection with
and without limiting the generality of Section 6.8(a), each of Parent and
Company shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Merger and transactions contemplated hereby.   (c) Each of
the Company, Parent and Sub shall give prompt notice to the other parties of
(i) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations
or proceedings commenced or, to such party\'s knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would cause any representation or warranty made by such
party contained in this Agreement (A) that is qualified by materiality,
Company Material Adverse Effect, Parent Material Adverse Effect or similar
words, to be untrue and (B) that is not so qualified to be untrue in any
material respect, and (iv) any material failure of such party to comply with
or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.8(c) shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with,
any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to
the party receiving such notice; provided further, however, that the failure
of the Company to perform its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.8(c)
shall not (A) affect Parent\'s and Sub\'s obligation to consummate the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby or (B) be a basis on which Parent
may terminate this Agreement, in each case except to the extent that such
failure to perform shall have resulted, individually or in the aggregate, in
a Company Material Adverse Effect.    41     Section 6.9 Sub and
Surviving Corporation. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a) cause
Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement, (b) cause Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and (c) ensure that, prior to the
Effective Time, Sub shall not conduct any business, make any investments or
incur or guarantee any indebtedness.   Section 6.10 Securityholder
Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against the
Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger, and no settlement of
such litigation shall be agreed to without Parent\'s prior consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided,
however, that (i) Parent shall not have any right to participate in the
defense of any securityholder litigation and (ii) the Company can settle
without the consent of Parent any securityholder litigation in which the
interests of the Company, its board of directors or any of its Affiliates are
adverse to the interests of Parent, its board of directors or any of its
Affiliates.   Section 6.11 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any
party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action
Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.  
Section 6.12 Certain Tax Matters.   (a) Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp
Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration or other fees and any similar
Taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"), and shall cooperate in attempting to
minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding
from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of the Common Stock, all
Transfer Taxes.   (b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall:   (i) continue
to operate in such a manner as to permit  the Company to continue to qualify
as a REIT throughout such period;   (ii) prepare and timely file all
material Tax Returns  required to be filed by them on or before the Closing
Date  ("Post-Signing Returns") in a manner consistent with past practice, 
except as otherwise required by applicable Law;   (iii) fully and timely pay
all material Taxes due and  payable in respect of such Post-Signing Returns
that are so filed;    42     (iv) properly reserve (and reflect such
reserve in  their books and records and financial statements) for all
material  Taxes payable by them for which no Post-Signing Return is due
prior  to the Effective Time in a manner consistent with past practice;
and   (v) pay any dividends or other distributions if  reasonably requested
in writing by Parent or otherwise necessary, in  the Company\'s reasonable
judgment, in order to maintain the  Company\'s status as a REIT or to
eliminate any United States federal  income tax liability of the Company as
determined under sections  857, 858 or 4981 of the Code.    ARTICLE VII 
CONDITIONS   Section 7.1 Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligation to
Effect the Merger. The obligations of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Sub, on the other hand, to consummate the Merger are subject to
the satisfaction (or waiver by the Company, Parent and Sub, if permissible
under applicable Law) of the following conditions:   (a) this Agreement
shall have been approved by the shareholders of the Company in accordance
with the WBCA and the Company Charter Documents;   (b) no Governmental
Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, Parent or Sub shall have issued
an order, decree, or ruling or taken any other action (collectively,
"Restraints") enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger
substantially on the terms contemplated by this Agreement; and   (c) any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
terminated.   Section 7.2 Conditions to the Obligations of Parent and
Sub. The obligations of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger are subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver by Parent and Sub) of the following
further conditions:   (a) each of the representations and warranties of
the Company other than the representations and warranties in Section 4.2(a)
and Section 4.7(a) shall be true and accurate in all respects as of the
Closing as if made at and as of such time (other than those representations
and warranties that address matters only as of a particular date or only
with respect to a specific period of time, which representations and
warranties need only be true and accurate as of such date or with respect to
such period), except where the failure of such representations and warranties
to be so true and accurate (without giving effect to any materiality
limitation, including as to "Company Material Adverse Effect", "materiality",
"material adverse effect" or like words set forth therein) would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
representations and warranties in Section 4.7(a) shall be true and correct as
of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date, and the
representations and warranties in Section 4.2(a) shall be true and correct in
all material respects as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the
Closing Date.    43     (b) the Company shall have performed in all
material respects its obligations hereunder required to be performed by it at
or prior to the Closing;   (c) Parent shall have received a certificate
signed by the chief financial officer of the Company, dated as of the Closing
Date, to the effect that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) and
Section 7.2(b) have been satisfied; and   (d) The Company shall have
received a tax opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP
("Skadden"), dated as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form set
forth in Section 7.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and rendered on
the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion
and the certificates obtained from officers of the Company, that, commencing
on January 1, 2006, the Company has been organized in conformity with the
requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and its actual method
of operation has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will enable,
the Company to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
(determined without taking into account, or giving effect to, the Merger, and
assuming for such purposes that the Company shall satisfy the applicable
distribution requirements under the Code for the taxable year including the
Closing Date). In rendering such opinion, Skadden shall be entitled to rely
upon customary assumptions, qualifications and representations.   Section
7.3 Conditions to the Obligations of the Company. The obligations of the
Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction (or waiver
by the Company) of the following further conditions:   (a) each of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Sub shall be true and accurate
in all respects as of the Closing as if made at and as of such time (other
than those representations and warranties that address matters only as of a
particular date or only with respect to a specific period of time, which
representations and warranties need only be true and accurate as of such date
or with respect to such period), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and accurate (without giving
effect to any materiality limitation, including as to "Parent Material
Adverse Effect", "materiality", "material adverse effect" or like words set
forth therein) would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect;   (b) each of Parent and Sub shall have performed
in all material respects all of the respective obligations hereunder required
to be performed by Parent or Sub, as the case may be, at or prior to the
Closing;   (c) the Company shall have received a certificate signed by the
chief financial officer of Parent, dated as of the Closing Date, to
the effect that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b)
have been satisfied; and   Section 7.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions.
None of the Company, Parent or Sub may rely on the failure of any condition
set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, as the case may be, to
be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party\'s breach of Section
6.8(a) or Section 6.8(b).    44     ARTICLE VIII  TERMINATION  
Section 8.1 Termination. Anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger contemplated
herein may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after shareholder approval of this Agreement:   (a) by the mutual
consent of the Company and Parent;   (b) by either the Company or
Parent:   (i) if the Merger shall not have occurred on or prior  to August
2, 2007 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that  the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(i)  shall not be available
to any party whose failure to fulfill any  obligation under this Agreement
has been the principal cause of, or  resulted in, the failure of the Merger
to occur on or prior to such  date; provided further, however, that if, as of
such date, all  conditions to this Agreement shall have been satisfied or
waived  (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied  at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such  conditions, other than the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b)  and
Section 7.1(c), at the Closing), then Parent or the Company may  extend the
Termination Date to October 2, 2007;   (ii) if any Restraint having the
effect set forth in  Section 7.1(b) is in effect and shall have become final
and  non-appealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this 
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available  to a
party (i) that has not complied with its obligations under  Section 6.8(a) or
Section 6.8(b) or (ii) if such Restraint was  primarily due to such party\'s
failure to perform any of its  obligations hereunder; or   (iii) if the
Company Special Meeting or any  adjournment or postponement thereof at which
a vote to approve this  Agreement was taken shall have concluded without the
receipt of the  Company Shareholder Approval.   (c) by the Company:   (i)
upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the  part of Parent or Sub, or
if any representation or warranty of  Parent or Sub shall be or become
untrue, in any case such that the  conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b) would not  be satisfied (assuming that the date of such
determination is the  Closing Date); provided that if such breach is curable
by Parent and  Sub through the exercise of their reasonable best efforts and
Parent  and Sub continue to exercise such reasonable best efforts, the 
Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section  8.1(c)(i);
provided further that the right to terminate this  Agreement under this
Section 8.1(c)(i) shall not be    45     available to the Company if it
has failed to perform in any material  respect any of its obligations under
or in connection with this  Agreement;   (ii) in accordance with the terms
and subject to the  conditions of Section 6.3(d) in order to enter into an
agreement for  a transaction pursuant to a Superior Proposal; provided that
the  Company shall have paid all amounts due pursuant to Section 8.2(b); 
or   (iii) in the event that a Company Adverse  Recommendation Change shall
have occurred in response to an  Intervening Event; or   (d) By Parent  
(i) upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the  part of the Company,
or if any representation or warranty of the  Company shall be or become
untrue, in any case such that the  conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.2(b) would not  be satisfied (assuming that the date of such
determination is the  Closing Date); provided that if such breach is curable
by the  Company through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts and the 
Company continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts, Parent  may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d)(i);  provided further that
the right to terminate this Agreement under  this Section 8.1(d)(i) shall not
be available to Parent if it has  failed to perform in any material respect
any of its obligations  under or in connection with this Agreement; or  
(ii) in the event that a Company Adverse  Recommendation Change shall have
occurred other than in response to  an Intervening Event.   Section 8.2
Effect of Termination.   (a) In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is made (any such notice pursuant
to Section 8.1(c)(iii), which notice shall include a description of the
Intervening Event to which it relates, being referred to herein as an
"Intervening Event Termination Notice"), and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void (except in the case of an Intervening Event Termination
Notice, in which case this Agreement shall terminate and become null and void
immediately after the fifth Business Day immediately following the date on
which Parent receives such Intervening Event Termination Notice), and there
shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company or their
respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, Representatives,
agents or advisors other than, with respect to Parent, Sub and the Company,
the obligations pursuant to (i) this Section 8.2; (ii) Section 6.3 and
Section 8.3, if Parent delivers to the Company written notice of the Tender
Offer Election in accordance with Section 8.3(a), but only through the end of
the Offer Completion Period; (iii) Article IX; and (iv) the last sentence of
Section 6.2(a); provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary   
46    contained in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Limited Access Agreement shall survive any such termination in accordance
with their respective terms. Nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall
relieve Parent, Sub or the Company from liability for fraud or willful breach
of this Agreement.   (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii) (subject to Section 8.3) or Section
8.1(c)(ii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) or (ii)(A) this
Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i) prior to the Company Special Meeting or pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i) (but only if, in the
case of such termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), the Company\'s breach
or failure triggering such termination shall have been willful), (B) after
the date hereof and prior to the Company Special Meeting (in the case of such
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii)) or the time of such termination
(in the case of such termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section
8.1(d)(i)), an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced and not
withdrawn or abandoned at the time of termination and (C) within one (1) year
after such termination, either (1) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or another Acquisition
Proposal, or (2) the Company consummates a transaction contemplated by such
Acquisition Proposal or another Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall
pay to Parent in cash a termination fee of $57,000,000 (the "Termination
Fee"), in connection with any termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii),
within two (2) Business Days after the later of (I) the last day of the
Election Period and (II) receipt by the Company of a Tender Offer Waiver;
within two (2) Business Days after any termination pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii); and concurrently with the event under clause (C) or Section
8.1(c)(ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii), no Termination Fee shall be payable if a
Tender Offer Election shall have been made. In no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.   (c) For
purposes of this Section 8.2, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 1.1, except that all references to
"30% or more" therein shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%."
Any payment to Parent contemplated by this Section 8.2 shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designed by Parent.  
Section 8.3 Tender Offer Alternative.   (a) Election Period. Within five (5)
Business Days immediately following the date of Parent\'s receipt of an
Intervening Event Termination Notice (such period of five (5) Business Days,
the "Election Period"), Parent shall either (i) elect to receive the
Termination Fee or (ii) elect to irrevocably waive and forfeit any right to
the Termination Fee by delivering notice of such election to the Company (the
notice under this clause (ii) being referred to herein as the "Tender Offer
Election") and proceed with the Offer as described below. If, immediately
after the expiration of the Election Period, Parent has not delivered or
caused to be delivered to the Company the notice of Tender Offer Election
referred to in the    47    immediately-preceding clause (ii), Parent
will be deemed to have made the election under the immediately-preceding
clause (i) and to have irrevocably forfeited its right to conduct a tender
offer under Section 8.3(b). If Parent makes or is deemed to have made the
election under the immediately-preceding clause (i), Parent shall deliver
written notice of such election to the Company (such notice, the "Tender
Offer Waiver") as a condition to the Company\'s obligation to pay the
Termination Fee. Any election or deemed election pursuant to this Section
8.3(a) shall be irrevocable.   (b) Tender Offer. Within ten (10) Business
Days after delivery by Parent of the Tender Offer Election (such ten Business
Day period, the "Tender Offer Launch Period"), Sub may commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) of the Exchange Act) a tender offer for all, but not
less than all, of the outstanding Common Stock at a purchase price per share
of no less than $24.75, net to the seller in cash (the "Offer"). The Offer
shall be open for a period of twenty (20) consecutive Business Days and shall
expire at 12:00 midnight (12:00 A.M.), Eastern time, immediately following
the twentieth Business Day of such period and may be extended only to the
extent approved by two-thirds of the Continuing Directors or to the extent
required by Law. The obligation of Sub to purchase and pay for shares of
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to (i) the
conditions that (A) there shall not have occurred, after the date of delivery
of the Tender Offer Election, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (B) the
Company\'s board of directors shall have approved Sub\'s purchase of shares
of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer for purposes of Section 23B.19.040 of
the WBCA and shall have amended the Rights Agreement to render the Rights
Agreement inapplicable to the Offer and the Second Step Merger (provided that
the condition in this clause (B) shall apply only if Parent and Sub have not
materially breached this Agreement), (C) there shall be no Restraint
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Offer and (D) any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired and (ii) the
non waivable condition that a number of shares of Common Stock representing
not less than two thirds of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding on a
fully diluted basis shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior
to the expiration date of the Offer (the "Minimum Condition"). Unless
previously approved by each of the Continuing Directors in writing, no change
in the Offer may be made, including any change (I) which decreases the price
per share of Common Stock payable in the Offer, (II) which changes the form
of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (III) which reduces the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased in the Offer or the Minimum
Condition, (IV) which imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those
described above or (V) which amends any other term of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of the Common Stock. Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Sub to, pay for all shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer as soon as practicable but in no event later than three (3) Business
Days after the expiration of the Offer. Immediately upon the expiration of
the Tender Offer Launch Period, in the event Sub has not commenced the Offer
within the Tender Offer Launch Period, Sub\'s right to commence a tender
offer with respect to securities of the Company pursuant to this Section
8.3(b) shall terminate. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Offer to be consummated within the thirty (30) Business Days immediately
after commencement of the Offer (the "Offer Completion Period").   (c)
Second Step Merger. If the Offer is consummated, Parent shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, but in no event more than 90 days thereafter, (i)
subject to applicable Law, cause Sub to be merged with and into the Company
(the "Second-Step Merger"), whereupon the separate corporate existence of Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation and (ii)
cause each holder of shares of Common Stock at the    48    effective
time of the Second Step Merger to be paid promptly after such effective time,
in consideration for each such share, an amount in cash equal to or greater
than the per share cash consideration paid for the shares purchased by Sub in
the Offer.   (d) Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, including any provision of Section 6.3, the Company
(including the board of directors of the Company), its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives shall not be subject to any limitations hereunder
on any disclosures with respect to the Offer or in making and disclosing
any recommendation to the Company\'s shareholders with respect the Offer, and
no such recommendation or disclosure shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement or trigger a right to any payments hereunder. For the
avoidance of doubt, in taking any action in connection with the Offer, the
Company\'s directors shall act in good faith in a manner that they believe to
be in the best interests of the Company and will consider such matters as
they deem appropriate in the exercise of their business judgment, which may
include consideration of the number of shares tendered in the Offer.   (e)
Corporate Governance. In the event a Tender Offer Election is made, until the
Second-Step Merger has been consummated and the applicable merger
consideration has been paid or properly provided for with respect to all
shareholders of the Company, Parent and Sub shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly
cause the number of directors of the Company to be fewer than three or
directly or indirectly cause there to be fewer than three
Continuing Directors.    ARTICLE IX  MISCELLANEOUS   Section 9.1
Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be
amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or
after any vote of the shareholders of the Company contemplated hereby, by
written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective
boards of directors (or individuals holding similar positions, in the case of
a party that is not a corporation), at any time prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any of the terms contained herein; provided, however, that
after the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no
such amendment, modification or supplement shall reduce or change the Merger
Consideration or adversely affect the rights of the Company\'s shareholders
hereunder without the approval of such shareholders; provided further that,
in the event a Tender Offer Election is given, from and after the time of
Parent\'s delivery of the Tender Offer Election, this Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented (and no waiver of any provision hereof may

9.4 Interpretation. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact, circumstance or
information in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to constitute disclosure of such fact, circumstance or information both with
respect to the correspondingly-numbered section of this Agreement and with
respect to any representation, warranty or covenant in any other section of
Article IV or Article VI of this Agreement to which such fact, circumstance
or information relates to the extent that the relevance of such fact,
circumstance or information to any representation, warranty or covenant in
such other section is reasonably apparent. The inclusion of any item in the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or
evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of
materiality for any purpose whatsoever.    51     Section 9.5
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by
facsimile transmission) in multiple counterparts, and by the different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed and
delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together

No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, including the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the exhibits hereto, together with the other
instruments referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Limited Access Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and (b) except as provided in Article III on or after the
Effective Time and Section 6.6, and except for the right of the Company, on
behalf of its shareholders, to pursue damages in the event of Parent\'s or
Sub\'s fraud or willful breach of this Agreement (which right is hereby
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Sub), is not intended to confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder;
provided that, from and after the consummation of the Tender Offer, the
shareholders of the Company shall be express third-party beneficiaries
of Section 8.3 and the provisions of this Agreement relating to the
enforcement, and the pursuit of remedies for breaches, of this Agreement.  
Section 9.7 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.   Section 9.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Washington applicable to contracts to be made and performed entirely therein
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any
other jurisdiction.   Section 9.9 Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto
hereby (a) expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of any United States federal court located in the State of
Washington or any Washington state court in the event any dispute arises out
of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a
United States federal or state court sitting in the State of Washington;
provided that each of the parties shall have the right to bring any action or
proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by any United States federal
court located in the State of Washington or any Washington state court in any
other court or jurisdiction.    52     Section 9.10 Service of
Process. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside
the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in Section 9.9 in any
such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered United
States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as
specified in or pursuant to Section 9.3. However, the foregoing shall not
limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by
any other legally available method.   Section 9.11 Specific Performance.
Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any
breach of this Agreement, each nonbreaching party would be irreparably and
immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for
specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (b)
shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this
Agreement in any action instituted in accordance with Section 9.9.  
Section 9.12 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties, provided, that Parent may assign any of its
rights and obligations to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns.   Section 9.13
Expenses. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the

except as provided in Section 6.2(b).   Section 9.14 Headings. Headings of
the articles and sections of this Agreement and the table of contents,
schedules and exhibits are for convenience of the parties only and shall be
given no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.   Section 9.15
Waivers. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any
of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein, or any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of any party, may be waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver
(and, if such party is the Company, subject to the approval of the Continuing
Directors pursuant to Section 9.1), but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement, condition,
representation or warranty shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.   Section 9.16 WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL. EACH OF PARENT, SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER

ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.    53
