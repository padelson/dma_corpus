(i) At the Redomestication Effective Time, every issued and outstanding
Parent Ordinary Share (other than those described in Section 2.6(c) or (d)
below) shall be converted automatically into one share of Purchaser Common
Stock. At the Redomestication Effective Time, all Parent Ordinary Shares
shall cease to be issued and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist. The holders of issued Parent Ordinary Shares
immediately prior to the Redomestication Effective Time, as evidenced by the
register of members of the Parent (the "Register of Members"), shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Parent Ordinary Shares, except as
provided herein or by Law. Each certificate (if any) previously evidencing

the Redomestication Surviving Corporation Stock Rights remain outstanding, a
sufficient number of shares of Redomestication Surviving Corporation Common
Stock for delivery upon the exercise of the Redomestication Surviving
Corporation Stock Rights after the Redomestication Effective Time.

(c)  _Cancellation of Parent Ordinary Shares Owned by Parent_. At the
Redomestication Effective Time, if there are any Parent Ordinary Shares that
are owned by the Parent as treasury shares or any Parent Ordinary Shares owned
by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent immediately
prior to the Redomestication Effective Time, such shares shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

  



  

(d)  _Dissenting Shares_. Upon the giving of a notice of election to dissent
pursuant to Section 179 of the BVI Law, each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights of a shareholder of the Company except the
right to be paid the fair value of such holder's shares as shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 179 of the BVI Law. If
any holder of Parent Ordinary Share fails to give written notice of such
holder election to dissent from the Redomestication Merger under Section 179
of BVI Law, then the rights of such holder of Parent Ordinary Shares under
Section 179 of BVI Law Act shall cease to exist, and the underlying Parent
Ordinary Shares shall be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.6(c) and shall
entitle the holder thereof only to receive compensation in accordance with
the provisions of Section 179 of the BVI Law.

  



  

(e)  _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for securities of Purchaser
is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Parent certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly
endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Purchaser or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for securities of Purchaser in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Purchaser or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  



  

(f)  _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 2.6_ , none of the Redomestication Surviving Corporation, Purchaser
or any party hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.

surrender of the Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with the terms hereof,

pertaining to such securities, provided that any restrictions on the sale and

shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Purchaser shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates or securities, as the case may
be, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such
securities, as may be required pursuant to _Section 2.7_ ; provided, however,
that Redomestication Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may

Certificate representing such shares is properly endorsed or otherwise is in
proper form for transfer. If any Share Certificate which immediately prior to

Company Preferred Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder claiming such Share
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed as provided in the Letter of

Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock represented by such lost, stolen or

thereof is entitled pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement;

Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") has occurred with respect to any
Plan. No Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated or is or has

Section 4975(a) of the Code. The Company has not maintained any Plan (other
than a Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code) which provides benefits with respect to current or former

multiemployer plan. No material liability has been, or could reasonably be

Company pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and/or Section 414 (b), (c), (m)
or (o) of the Code with respect to any "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA).

connection with their duties as directors or officers of the Company, as

available by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, for a

occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in an amount and scope at least
as favorable as the coverage applicable to directors and officers as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company's directors' and
officer's insurance policy (the " _D andO Tail Policy_"). If the Merger is
consummated, then Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation will not cancel the
DandO Tail Policy during its term.

  



  

(c) The provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation in respect of indemnification shall not be amended,
repealed, or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the

successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such

use commercially reasonable efforts so that the successors and assigns of
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor
the indemnification set forth in this Section 9.7.

  



  

(e) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation and Purchaser under this
Section 9.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Person to whom this Section 9.7 applies without the prior
written consent of such affected Person.

INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

11.1  _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company
Indemnitees, against and in respect of any and all Losses incurred or
sustained by any Company Indemnitee as a result of or in connection with any
breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment or the alleged breach, inaccuracy or
nonfulfillment of any of the representations, warranties and covenants of the
Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub contained herein or any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto. Any liability incurred by the Company
Indemnitees pursuant to the terms of this Article XI shall be paid by
issuance of Reserved Shares.

  



  

(b) The Company hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub, each of its Affiliates and each
of its and their respective members, managers, partners, directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, attorneys and agents and permitted assignees (the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ "), against and in respect of any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by any Purchaser Indemnitee as a result of or in
connection with any breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment or the alleged
breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of any of the representations, warranties
and covenants of the Company contained herein or any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto. Any liability incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnitees pursuant to the terms of this Article XI shall be paid by
issuance of Reserved Shares.

  



  

11.2  _Procedure_. The following shall apply with respect to all claims by
any Company Indemnitee or the Purchaser Indemnitee as the case may be (an
"Indemnified Party") for indemnification:

  



  

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying party/parties (an "
_Indemnifying Party_ " or " _Indemnifying Parties_ " as the case may be)
prompt notice (an " _Indemnification Notice_ ") of any third-party
action with respect to which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.1 (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), which shall describe in
reasonable detail the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified
Party. The failure to give the Indemnification Notice shall not impair any of
the rights or benefits of such Indemnified Party under Section 11.1,
except to the extent such failure materially and adversely affects the
ability of the Indemnifying Parties to defend such claim or increases the
amount of such liability.

  



    

47 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) In the case of any Third-Party Claims as to which indemnification is
sought by any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at
the sole expense and liability of the Indemnifying Parties, to exercise full
control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third-Party Claim
unless the Indemnifying Parties, within a reasonable time after the giving of
an Indemnification Notice by the Indemnified Parties (but in any event within
ten (10) days thereafter), shall (i) deliver a written confirmation to such
Indemnified Party that the indemnification provisions of Section 11.1 are
applicable to such action and the Indemnifying Parties will indemnify such
Indemnified Party in respect of such action pursuant to the terms of Section
11.1 and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, shall do so without
asserting any challenge, defense, limitation on the Indemnifying
Parties' liability for Losses, counterclaim or offset, (ii) notify such
Indemnified Party in writing of the intention of the Indemnifying Parties to
assume the defense thereof, and (iii) retain legal counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such Third-
Party Claim.

  



  

(c) If the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to Section 11.2(b), then the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnifying Parties in any manner reasonably requested in connection
with the defense, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to be kept
fully informed by the Indemnifying Parties and their legal counsel with
respect to the status of any legal proceedings, to the extent not
inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work
product privilege. If the Indemnifying Parties so assume the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense,
compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Parties have agreed to pay such fees and
expenses, or (ii) the named parties to any such Third-Party Claim
(including any impleaded parties) include an Indemnified Party and an
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its
counsel that there may be a conflict of interest between such Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Parties in the conduct of the defense thereof, and
in any such case the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel
shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties.

  



  

(d) If the Indemnifying Parties elect to assume the defense of any Third-
Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.2(b), the Indemnified Party shall not pay,
or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such
asserted liability unless the Indemnifying Parties withdraw from or fail to
vigorously prosecute the defense of such asserted liability, or unless a
judgment is entered against the Indemnified Party for such liability. If the
Indemnifying Parties do not elect to defend, or if, after commencing or
undertaking any such defense, the Indemnifying Parties fail to adequately
prosecute or withdraw such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the Indemnifying
Parties' expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Indemnifying
Parties shall not be entitled to control, but may participate in, and the
Indemnified Party (at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties) shall be
entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of (x) that
part of any Third-Party Claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the
Indemnified Party, or (ii) to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves
criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party or (y) the entire Third-
Party Claim if such Third-Party Claim would impose liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party in an amount which is greater than the amount as to
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement. In the event the Indemnified Party retains control of the Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not settle the subject claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



    

48 
--- 

 



    



  

(e) If the Indemnifying Parties undertake the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to Section 11.1 and propose to settle the same prior to a
final judgment thereon or to forgo appeal with respect thereto, then the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Parties prompt written notice
thereof and the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to participate in
the settlement, assume or reassume the defense thereof or prosecute such
appeal, in each case at the Indemnifying Parties' expense. The Indemnifying
Parties shall not, without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party
settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any
such Third-Party Claim (i) in which any relief other than the payment of money
damages is or may be sought against such Indemnified Party, (ii) in which
such Third-Party Claim could be reasonably expected to impose or create a
monetary liability on the part of the Indemnified Party (such as an increase
in the Indemnified Party's income Tax) other than the monetary claim of the
third party in such Third-Party Claim being paid pursuant to such settlement
or judgment, or (iii) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant, person conducting such investigation or
initiating such hearing, plaintiff or petitioner to such Indemnified Party of
a release from all liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim and all
other actions (known or unknown) arising or which might arise out of the same
facts.

  



  

11.3  _Reserved Shares_. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the
Reserved Shares to be reserved for issuance pursuant to this Section 11.3.

  



  

(a)  _Rights to the Reserved Shares_. Other than in connection with the
payment of any Losses pursuant to this Article XI, no party shall have any
rights to the Reserved Shares, including voting rights or rights to dividends,
interest payments or other distributions of any kind made in respect of the
Reserved Shares.

  



  

(b)  _Distribution of Reserved Shares_. In the event of payment of a Loss to
an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 11.1(a) or 11.1(b), as applicable,
then, within three (3) Business Days of the determination of amount of the
Loss, (A) the Stockholders' Representative and Purchaser shall provide for
joint written instruction to be given to the Purchaser's Transfer Agent ("
_Joint Written instruction_ ") to issue such number of Reserved Shares to the
Indemnified Party(ies) as set forth in such Joint Written Instruction. The
number of Reserved Shares to be issued as payment for a Loss shall be
calculated based on the volume weighted average price per share at which
Purchaser's Common Stock traded on NASDAQ over the five trading day period
preceding the date on which the claim for indemnification for which the Loss
is to be paid was made by the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(c)  _Release of Reserved Shares_. Upon the resolution of all unresolved
indemnification claims set forth in any Indemnification Notice provided prior
to the expiration of the Survival Period (the " _Release Date_ "), the
Stockholders' Representative and Purchaser shall provide Joint Written
Instruction to the Purchaser's Transfer Agent no party shall have any claim
to any Reserved Shares not issued and such remaining Reserved Shares shall be
held in the treasury of the Company.

  



    

49 
--- 

 



    



  

11.4  _Limitations of Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Subject to Section11.4(b), with respect to indemnification for any Losses
based upon, attributable to or related to Section 11.1(a) or 11.1(b), (i)
neither the Purchaser, the Company nor the Stockholders shall have any
liability unless the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the Indemnified
Party exceeds $700,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") and then only for such
amounts in excess of the Deductible and (ii) no amounts of indemnity shall be
payable by the Indemnifying Party which exceeds the Reserved Shares (the "
_Indemnity Cap_ ").

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to
indemnification for any Losses based upon, attributable to or related to
fraud or willful misconduct of a Purchaser Indemnitee or Company Indemnitee,
the Indemnity Cap shall not apply.

  



  

11.5  _Periodic Payments_. Any indemnification required by Section 11.1 for
costs, disbursements or expenses of any Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Action shall be made by
periodic payments by the Indemnifying Parties to each Indemnified Party
during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are
received or costs, disbursements or expenses are incurred.

  



  

11.6  _Survival of Indemnification Rights_. Except for the representations
and warranties in Section 6.1 (Corporate Existence and Power), Section 6.2
(Corporate Authorization), and Section 6.5 (Finders' Fees) which shall survive
until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations
with respect thereto (including any extensions and waivers thereof), the
representations and warranties of Purchaser shall survive until twelve months
(the "Survival Period") following the Closing. The indemnification to which
any Indemnified Party is entitled from the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to
Section 11.1 for Losses shall be effective so long as it is asserted prior to
the date that is twelve months following the Closing.

14.2  _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by each
party, and cannot be terminated orally or by course of conduct. No provision
hereof can be waived, except by a writing signed by the party against whom
such waiver is to be enforced, and any such waiver shall apply only in the
particular instance in which such waiver shall have been given.

  



  

(b) Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of
dealing shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from enforcing any
right or remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to
or demand on a party shall waive or otherwise affect any obligation of that
party or impair any right of the party giving such notice or making such
demand, including any right to take any action without notice or demand not
otherwise required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy with
respect to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any other
right or remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved party whole with respect
to such breach, or subsequent exercise of any right or remedy with respect to
any other breach.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no statement herein of any
right or remedy shall impair any other right or remedy stated herein or that
otherwise may be available.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither shall any party
seek, nor shall any party be liable for, punitive or exemplary damages, under
any tort, contract, equity, or other legal theory, with respect to any breach
(or alleged breach) of this Agreement or any provision hereof or any matter
otherwise relating hereto or arising in connection herewith.

  



  

14.3  _Arm 's length bargaining; no presumption against drafter_. This
Agreement has been negotiated at arm's-length by parties of equal bargaining
strength, each represented by counsel or having had but declined the
opportunity to be represented by counsel and having participated in the
drafting of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other
special relationship between the parties, and no such relationship otherwise
exists. No presumption in favor of or against any party in the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof
shall be made based upon which Person might have drafted this Agreement or
such provision.

  



  

14.4  _Publicity_. Except as required by law and except with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents, the parties agree that neither they nor their agents
shall issue any press release or make any other public disclosure concerning
the transactions contemplated hereunder without the prior approval of the
other party hereto. If a party is required to make such a disclosure as
required by law, the parties will use their best efforts to cause a mutually
agreeable release or public disclosure to be issued.

  



  

14.5  _Expenses_. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
unless otherwise specified herein.

14.6  _No Assignment or Delegation_. No party may assign any right or
delegate any obligation hereunder, including by merger,
consolidation, operation of law, or otherwise, without the written consent of
the other party. Any purported assignment or delegation without such consent
shall be void, in addition to constituting a material breach of this
Agreement.

  



  

14.7  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
the conflict of laws principles thereof.

  



  

14.8  _Counterparts; facsimile signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which
shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall become effective upon
delivery to each party of an executed counterpart or the earlier delivery to
each party of original, photocopied, or electronically transmitted signature
pages that together (but need not individually) bear the signatures of all
other parties.

  



  

14.9  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, sets forth the entire agreement of
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements related
thereto (whether written or oral), all of which are merged herein. No
provision of this Agreement may be explained or qualified by any agreement,
negotiations, understanding, discussion, conduct or course of conduct or by
any trade usage. Except as otherwise expressly stated herein, there is no
condition precedent to the effectiveness of any provision hereof. No party
has relied on any representation from, or warranty or agreement of, any
person in entering into this Agreement, prior hereto or contemporaneous
herewith, except those expressly stated herein.

  



  

14.10  _Severability_. A determination by a court or other legal authority
that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is legally
invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
hereof. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or cause
such court or other legal authority to substitute) for any provision so held
to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid
provision as is lawful.

  



  

14.11  _Construction of certain terms and references; captions_. In this
Agreement:

  



  

(a) References to particular sections and subsections, schedules, and
exhibits not otherwise specified are cross-references to sections and
subsections, schedules, and exhibits of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder," and words of similar import
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement, and, unless the context requires otherwise, "party" means a

(c) Any use of the singular or plural, or the masculine, feminine, or neuter
gender, includes the others, unless the context otherwise requires;
"including" means "including without limitation;" "or" means "and/or;" "any"
means "any one, more than one, or all;" and, unless otherwise specified, any
