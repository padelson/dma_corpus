-iii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated February 24, 2016 (this " _Agreement_ "),
by and among PowerSecure International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), The Southern Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and
PSMS Corp., a Delaware corporation and Parent Subsidiary (" _Merger Sub_ ").

 

RECITALS

A. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), the Board
of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") and the Board of Directors of
Merger Sub have determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and stockholders to consummate the transactions provided
for in this Agreement in which Merger Sub will, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ "), with the Company being the surviving corporation in the
Merger.

B. The Parties desire to make or enter into certain representations,
warranties and covenants in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

 

The Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub will be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue
as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and will
succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in
accordance with the DGCL.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger will take
place at the offices of Jones Day, 1420 Peachtree Street, N.E., Suite 800,
Atlanta, Georgia 30309 at 10:00 a.m. local time on the second Business Day
following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of those conditions at
Closing), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by
the Parties. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date._ "

Section 1.3  _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company will cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (collectively,
the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and will

 



1  make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection
with the Merger. The Merger will become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such
other time as Parent and the Company will agree and specify in the Certificate
of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_
").

 

Section 1.4 _Effects_. The Merger will have the effects provided in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.5 _Conversion of Securities_.

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of the Company Common Stock, each share of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and any Shares to be
cancelled pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _1.5(b)_ ) will be converted automatically
into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
$18.75 in cash without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable in
the manner set forth in _Section_ _ _ _2.1_. All shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will be
automatically cancelled and cease to exist. Except as set forth in _Section_
_ _ _1.5(b)_ , as a result of the Merger, each holder of a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (" _Certificates_ ") and each holder of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are not represented by
Certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") will thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, to be paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section_ _ _ _2.1(b)_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, _Section_ _ _ _2.1(h)_ ).

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by
any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution will be made with respect thereto.

(c)  _Shares of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $.01, of Merger Sub will be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.6 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Company Charter will, by virtue of the Merger,
be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth on  _Exhibit_ _
_ _A_ , and as so amended and restated will be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the DGCL.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company Bylaws will, by virtue of the Merger,
be amended and restated to read in their entirety as the Merger Sub Bylaws as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and
restated will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended in accordance with the DGCL.

 



2 Section 1.7 _Directors_. The Parties will take all necessary action such that
from and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub prior to the
Effective Time will become the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until
the earlier of their death, incapacity, resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

Section 1.8 _Officers_. The Parties will take all necessary action such that
from and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time will become the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their death, incapacity, resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

 

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

Section 2.1 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Shares for
the Merger Consideration and enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent
relating to the services to be performed by the Exchange Agent. Parent will
deposit or will cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent at or prior to
the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _1.5(a)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
The Exchange Fund will be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by
Parent. Any interest or other income from such investments will be paid to and
become income of Parent. Except as contemplated by  _Section_ _ _ _2.1(d)_ ,
the Exchange Fund will not be used for any purpose other than as specified in
this _Section_ _ _ _2.1(a)_. To the extent that there are losses with respect
to any investments made by the Exchange Agent of the Exchange Fund, Parent
shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the
Exchange Agent to promptly pay the Merger Consideration.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event not
later than the second Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was, at the

 



3  Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _1.5(a)_ : (A) a letter of transmittal
in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify (including a provision confirming that delivery will be effected, and
risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holders Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration
issuable and payable in respect thereof pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares will be effected in accordance
with the Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to
securities represented by book entry.

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent
for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent,
the holder of such Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange for such
properly surrendered Shares an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
number of Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and (B) the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid
upon surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid, as the
case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company will occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

(e)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to
the holders of Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only to
Parent for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to 
_Section_ _ _ _1.5(a)_.

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will be liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund or other cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a
date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



4 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent, Parent and Merger Sub will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the Treasury Regulations, any provision of applicable state,
local or foreign Tax Law or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such
withheld amounts will be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate will have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration; except that Parent may,
in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

Section 2.2 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company will be closed and there will be no further registration
of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason will be cancelled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _1.5(a)_.

 

Section 2.3 _Company Stock Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Each option award to purchase Shares granted
under the Company Equity Incentive Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ")
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be deemed to
be fully vested and will be cancelled, with the holder thereof becoming
entitled to receive an amount in cash, payable in accordance with _Section_ _
_ _2.3(f)_ , equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to
such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option. Any Company Stock
Option with an exercise price greater than the Merger Consideration will be
cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each award of
restricted Shares granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plans (each, a "
_Company Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective

 



5  Time (other than the Rollover Restricted Shares) will be deemed to be fully
vested and will be cancelled, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to
receive an amount in cash, payable in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _2.3(f)_
, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such award
of Company Restricted Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the Merger Consideration, together with any dividends credited thereto
in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement.

(c) _Rollover Restricted Shares_. The Rollover Restricted Shares that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled in exchange
for a restricted stock unit award (the " _Rollover RSU Award_ ") covering a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole
share, equal to: X _multiplied by_ Y _divided_ by Z, where "X" is the total
number of Rollover Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time,
"Y" is the Merger Consideration and "Z" is the Parent Closing Price. From and
after the Effective Time, the Rollover RSU Award will be subject to the terms
set forth in _Section 2.3(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(d) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock
units payable in whole or in part in Shares, or the value of which is
determined with reference to the value of Shares, and granted under the
Company Equity Incentive Plans (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be deemed to be fully
vested and will be cancelled, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to
receive an amount in cash, payable in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _2.3(f)_ ,
equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such award
of Company RSUs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Merger Consideration, together with any dividends credited thereto in
accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement.

(e) _Company PSUs_. At the Effective Time, each award of performance share
units payable in whole or in part in Shares, or the value of which is
determined with reference to the value of Shares, and granted under the
Company Equity Incentive Plans (each, a " _Company PSU_ ") that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be deemed vested based on
target level of achievement and will be cancelled, with the holder thereof
becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash, payable in accordance with
_Section_ _ _ _2.3(f)_ , equal to the product of (i) the target number of
Shares subject to such award of Company PSUs as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration, together with any dividends
credited thereto in accordance with the terms of the applicable award
agreement.

 

(f) _Payment_. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than
five Business Days) following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will pay the amounts due to the holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _2.3(a)_ , the amounts due to the holders of Company Restricted
Shares pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _2.3(b)_ , the amounts due to the holders
of Company RSUs pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.3(d)_ and the amounts due to the
holders of Company PSUs in accordance with  _Section_ _ _ _2.3(e)_ , in each
case without interest and subject to any required Tax

 



6  withholding. To the extent any amounts described in this _Section_ _ _
_2.3(f)_ relate to a Company Stock Award that is nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation
will pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the
applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Company Stock Award
that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(g) _Notice_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will be permitted (but
not obligated) to send a written notice in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent to each holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option, Company
Restricted Share, Company RSU and Company PSU (the " _Company Stock Awards_ ")
that will inform such holder of the treatment of such awards as provided in
this _Section_ _ _ _2.3_ , and otherwise setting forth such holders rights
pursuant to the applicable Company Equity Incentive Plan and equity award
agreements.

 

(h) _Further Assurances_. The Company will, prior to the Effective Time, take
(or cause to be taken) any and all actions as may be necessary (including
obtaining any resolutions of the Company Board and, to the extent required,
any committee thereof) to implement the foregoing provisions of this _Section_
_ _ _2.3_.

 

(i) _No Further Rights_. Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company
Stock Award, participant in any Company Equity Incentive Plan or other
Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company or party
to any employment agreement with the Company will have any right hereunder to
acquire any capital stock or other Equity Interests (including any "phantom"
stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
the Surviving Corporation.

(j) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery with respect
to, and shall register on Form S-8 (or such other appropriate form) a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to satisfy the settlement of, the
Rollover RSU Award.

Section 2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and are held by a stockholder who is entitled to demand,
and properly demands, appraisal of such Shares (each, a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
will not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (except as provided in this _Section_ _ _ _2.4_ ) and will
entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares as may be determined to be due to the holder of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the DGCL, unless and until such
Dissenting Stockholder effectively waives, withdraws or loses the right to
appraisal under the DGCL or is otherwise no longer entitled to the relief
provided by the DGCL. If any such Dissenting Stockholder effectively waives,
withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under the DGCL or is

 



7  otherwise no longer entitled to the relief provided by the DGCL, then as of
the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, the
Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder will be cancelled and
cease to exist and be converted into and represent the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Article_ _ _ _I_ and  _Article_ _ _ _II_ , less applicable withholding
taxes, if any, required to be withheld. The Company will not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make (or cause or permit to be
made on its behalf) any payment with respect to, or settle or make a binding
offer to settle with, any Dissenting Stockholder regarding its exercise of
dissenters rights prior to the Effective Time. The Company will give Parent
notice of any such demands prior to the Effective Time, and Parent will have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any exercise by any stockholder of dissenters rights.

applicable to such Company Reports, and none of the Company Reports as of such
respective dates (or, if amended, the date of the filing or furnishing, as
applicable, of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are
amended) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information required to be
disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
enable the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.

Subsidiaries has duly filed all material federal, state, foreign and local
Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them (all such returns being
accurate and complete in all material respects) and has duly paid or made
provision for the payment of all Taxes that have been incurred or are due or
claimed to be due from them by federal, state, foreign or local taxing
authorities other than (a) Taxes that are not yet delinquent or that are being
contested in good faith, have not been finally determined and have
been adequately reserved against or (b) Tax Returns or Taxes as to which the

Material Adverse Effect. Any material liability with respect to deficiencies
asserted as a result of any audit, examination or similar proceeding of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary Tax Return by the IRS or any other taxing
authority is covered by adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP in the
Company Financial Statements. There are no material disputes pending, or

 



14  claims asserted in writing, for Taxes or assessments upon the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries for which the Company does not have adequate

is or may be subject to tax by that jurisdiction. Each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with all terms

mandatory subjects of bargaining under any Law will not be considered such a
restriction.

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the

advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection
with, any proposed notifications or filings and any written communications or

preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. Subject to _Section_ _ _ _6.9_ , the
Proxy Statement will include the Company Board Recommendation. Parent will
cooperate with the Company in the preparation and filing of the Proxy

necessary in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and is
reasonably requested by the Company. The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing and the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that
the SEC staff has no further comments thereon. Prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement or filing any other required documents (or in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company will provide Parent with an opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response 

 



34  (including by participating in any discussions or meetings with the SEC) and

counsel. The Company will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional

the Transactions.

(b) If, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information will as promptly as practicable notify the other Party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information will be filed
with the SEC as promptly as practicable after the other Party has had a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
The Proxy Statement will comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and other
applicable Law, including the regulations and requirements of NYSE.

 

(c) The Company will call a meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in any event no later than 40 days after such
clearance with the SEC or, if the SEC does not review the Proxy Statement, 40
days after the earliest date on which the Company could mail the Proxy
Statement pursuant to the Exchange Act) after the Proxy Statement is cleared
by the SEC staff for mailing to consider and vote on approval of this
Agreement and any other matters required to be voted upon by the Companys
stockholders in connection with the Transactions (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "). Subject to and
until the Company Board effects a Change of Recommendation pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _6.9(c)_ , the Company Board will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from its stockholders the Company Stockholder Approval.
Subject to _Section_ _ _ _6.9(c)_ , the Company Board will recommend that its
stockholders vote in favor of approval of this Agreement (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ "). Subject to the Companys right to terminate this
Agreement under _Section_ _ _ _8.1(d)(ii)_ , the Company and Parent agree that
the Companys obligations pursuant to the first two sentences of this

the withdrawal or modification by the Company Board of the Company
Board Recommendation.

(a) Upon reasonable notice, the Company will, and will cause each Company
Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and to the officers, employees, accountants,

or leased properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel (including
contractors and distributors), records, Tax Returns and all other information
concerning its business, operations, status of compliance with Environmental
Law, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; except that
Parent and its Representatives will conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries; and except further that such access

(including any Phase II environmental assessments) of any environmental media
or any physical assets of the Company; and except further that the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries will not be required to provide any access or
disclose any information if such access or disclosure would contravene any
applicable Law or where such access or disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information or contravene any fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement.

subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into
between the Company and Parents Subsidiary as of June 1, 2015 (the "

year following the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates
to, provide each Company Employee with (i) base compensation and, subject to

item of compensation, is no less favorable than the base compensation and cash
bonus opportunity provided to each such Company Employee on the Closing Date,
and (ii) all other compensation and benefits (excluding equity compensation
and severance benefits) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
other compensation and benefits (excluding equity compensation and severance
benefits) provided to each such Company Employee on the Closing Date. Nothing
in this _Section_ _ _ _6.4(a)_ will obligate Parent, Surviving Corporation or
the Company to continue the employment of any such Company Employee for any
specific period.

  



36 (b) _Employee Service Credit_. Parent (i) will give, and will cause its
Affiliates to, give, each Company Employee credit for service with the
Company and any Company Subsidiary or predecessor employer prior to the
Closing Date under any comparable Company Benefit Plan, to the same extent
recognized by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any comparable
employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or its Affiliates (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) for
all purposes (including eligibility to participate, vesting in eligible
benefits and levels of benefits) other than for benefit accrual purposes under
a defined benefit pension plan; except that Company Employees will not be
entitled to the benefit of any grandfathered benefit or benefit formula
that would not be provided to any employee first hired by Parent on or after
the Effective Time, (ii) will give, and cause its Affiliates to give, each

of entitlement to benefits thereunder, (iii) subject to _Section 6.4(d)_ ,
will allow, and cause its Affiliates to allow, such Company Employees to
participate in each Company Benefit Plan and any substitute employee benefit
plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates providing welfare
benefits (including medical, life insurance, long-term disability insurance
and long-term care insurance) in the plan year in which the Closing occurs
without regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence
of insurability or other exclusions or limitations to the extent otherwise
satisfied as of the Closing and (iv) will credit, and cause its Affiliates to
credit, the Company Employee with any expenses that were covered by the
Company Benefit Plans for purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and
other applicable limits under the Company Benefit Plan in which they
participate and any similar replacement plans.

 

(c) _Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays_. Parent will continue, and cause its
Affiliates to continue, to credit to each Company Employee all vacation and
personal holiday pay that the Company Employee is entitled to use but has not
used as of the Closing Date (including any earned vacation or personal holiday
pay to be used in future years) subject to Parents vacation day carryover
policy.

(d) _Certain Commitments_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, treat the Transactions as constituting a
"change in control," "change of control" or similar terms under the Company
Benefit Plans and any such other Company compensation and severance
arrangements or agreements. Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to,
assume, honor and fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement or as
subsequently amended as permitted pursuant to the terms of such Company
Benefit Plans and this Agreement.

(e) _Bonus Plans_. Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, operate
the Companys incentive plans and all other bonus arrangements (collectively,
" _Bonus_

 



37   _Plans_ "), as applicable, for 2016 in accordance with the terms
established in the ordinary course of business; except that, to the extent
applicable, performance goals under such Bonus Plans established in the
ordinary course of business will be reasonably adjusted by Parent in good
faith to reflect the consummation of the Transactions; provided that degree of
difficulty of achieving the goals shall not be increased.

 

(f) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement will create any
right or obligation which is enforceable by any Company Employee or any other
Person with respect to any terms or conditions of employment, including, but
not limited to, the benefits and compensation described in this _Section_ _ _
_6.4_. Any amendments to the Companys, the Company Subsidiaries, Parents
and the Surviving Corporations benefit and compensation plans, programs or
arrangements will occur only in accordance with their respective terms and
will be pursuant to action taken by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation which are independent of the consummation
of this Agreement or any continuing obligations hereunder.

 

Section 6.5 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless (including by advancing expenses) each current and
former director, officer and employee of the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including fees and expenses
of legal counsel) in connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative) (each, a " _Claim_ "), whenever asserted, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission relating to their
position with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to
have occurred before or at the Effective Time (including any Claim relating in
whole or in part to the Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law. Each of (x) the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws and the respective organizational documents of each of the Company
Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (y) any indemnification agreements
with an Indemnified Party listed on _Section_ _ _ _6.5(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, which will in each case survive the Transactions and
continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
will not, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties except, in the case of clauses
_(x)_ and _(y)_ , as required by applicable Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to cause the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to include
provisions for limitation of liabilities, indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of the

 



38  Indemnified Parties no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than as set
forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this
Agreement, which provisions will, for a period of six years from the
Effective Time, not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties
except as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from the
Companys current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (the " _D andO Insurance_") for the persons who, as of the
date of this Agreement, are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance.
Such "tail" insurance policies will have terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing DandO
Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions); except that the maximum aggregate premium for such insurance
policies for any such year will not be in excess of the Maximum Premium.
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such " _tail_ "
insurance policies in full force and effect for their full term. If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain
in effect, at no expense to the Indemnified Parties, for a period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time, the Companys DandO Insurance in
place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or, if such insurance is
unavailable, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, purchase the best available DandO Insurance for such
six-year period from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to the
Companys existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and with
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; except that neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to pay an aggregate premium for
such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance (the "
_Maximum Premium_ "); and if the premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not
in substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _6.5_.

 



39 Section 6.6 _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, in case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties,
assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of the Company, the
then-current officers and directors of each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries will use its respective reasonable best efforts to take all such
actions as may be reasonably requested by Parent. 

Section 6.7 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and the Company will promptly
advise the other of any change or event, of which it has knowledge, (a)
having or reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a
Company Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or (b) that would or
would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement if it
would result in the failure of closing conditions in _Section_ _ _ _7.3(a)_ or
_Section_ _ _ _7.3(b)_ or  _Section_ _ _ _7.2(a)_ or _Section_ _ _ _7.2(b)_ ,
respectively, by the Outside Date, except that (i) no such notification will
affect the representations, warranties or covenants of the Parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement and (ii) a failure to comply with this _Section_
_ _ _6.7_ will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in 
_Article_ _ _ _VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying Parent Material
Adverse Effect, Company Material Adverse Effect or material breach would
independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in  _Article_ _
_ _VII_ to be satisfied. The Company will promptly advise Parent of all
developments in, and the receipt of all communications from any Governmental
Entities with respect to, the matters described in  _Section_ _ _ _5.2(e)_ of

40 Section 6.9 _No Solicitation or Change of Recommendation_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation_.

 

(i) Except as set forth in _Section_ _ _ _6.9(a)(ii)_ and _Section_ _ _
_6.9(a)(iii)_ , the Company agrees that none of the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, managers or
directors (collectively, the " _Company Non-Solicit Parties_ ") will, and that
they will instruct and cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly:

(A) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries,
discussions regarding, or the making or submission of, any proposal, request
or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Alternative Proposal;

 

(B) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any Contract or agreement in
principle, whether written or oral, with any Person (other than Parent and
Merger Sub) concerning any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar Contract concerning an Alternative Proposal (other
than negotiating and entering into a confidentiality and standstill agreement
as described in _Section_ _ _ _6.9(a)(iii)_ ) (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ");

 

(C) terminate, amend, release, modify, or fail to enforce any provision of, or
grant any permission, waiver or request under, any standstill,
confidentiality or similar Contract entered into by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary in respect of or in contemplation of an Alternative Proposal (other
than to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that
failure to take any such actions under this _Section_ _ _ _6.9(a)(i)(C)_ would
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties or obligations
under applicable Law);

(D) conduct, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal with any third party
(excluding, for avoidance of doubt, the Companys Representatives);

 

(E) furnish any non-public information relating to the Company, or afford
access to the books or records or Representatives of the Company, to any
third party that, to the knowledge of the Company, after consultation with its
Representatives, is seeking to or may make, or has made, an Alternative
Proposal;

 



41 (F) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Laws inapplicable
to any transactions contemplated by any Alternative Proposal; or

(G) resolve or publicly propose or announce to do any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _6.9(a)(i)_ will
prohibit the Company Non-Solicit Parties from contacting any Person who has
made a Bona Fide Alternative Proposal solely to request clarification of the
terms and conditions thereof to the extent necessary to permit the Company
Board to determine whether such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
the conditions in  _Section_ _ _ _6.9(a)(iii)_ and solely in response to a
Bona Fide Alternative Proposal made on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Non-Solicit Parties
may, with respect to the Person that has made such Bona Fide Alternative
Proposal:

(A) in response to a request therefor by such Person, provide information or
afford access to the books and records or Representatives of the Company; and

(B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person
(and its Representatives) with respect to such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal.

 

(iii) The Company may not take the actions described in _Section_ _ _
_6.9(a)(ii)_ unless, prior to taking any such action:

(A) the Company has (1) received from such Person an executed confidentiality
and standstill agreement on terms that are no less restrictive than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (and compliant with the last
sentence of _Section_ _ _ _6.9(g)_ ) and (2) disclosed to Parent (and, if
applicable, contemporaneously provided copies of) any non-public information
to be provided to such Person and any books or records to which such Person
will be afforded access, in each case, to the extent not previously provided
to Parent;

 

(B) the Company has delivered to Parent written notice prior to taking any
such action (1) stating that the Company Board intends to take such action,
(2) stating that the Company Board has made the determination set forth in
_Section_ _ _ _6.9(a)(iii)(C)_ and (3) including an unredacted copy of such
Bona Fide Alternative Proposal (including any materials relating to such
Persons proposed equity and debt financing, if any) and an executed copy of
the confidentiality and standstill agreement described in _Section_ _ _
_6.9(a)(iii)(A)_ ; and

 

(C) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside financial and legal advisors, that (1) such Bona Fide Alternative
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties or obligations under applicable Law.

(iv) Without limiting  _Section_ _ _ _6.9(a)(iii)_ , if the Company provides
any non-public information to any Person in reliance on _Section_ _ _
_6.9(a)(ii)_ that has not previously been provided to Parent, then the Company
will provide such information promptly to Parent.

 



42 (b) _No Change of Recommendation_. Except as set forth in  _Section_ _ _
_6.9(c)_ , no Company Non-Solicit Party will:

(i) withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Board Recommendation;

(ii) fail to announce publicly, within 10 Business Days after a tender offer
or exchange offer relating to any securities of the Company has been
commenced, that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer;

 

(iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
distributed to the Companys stockholders in connection with the
Transactions;

(iv) approve, adopt or recommend any Alternative Proposal; or

 

(v) resolve or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any such
prohibited action described in  _Section_ _ _ _6.9(b)(i)_ through this
_Section_ _ _ _6.9(b)(v)_ being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_
");

 

except that the making of any determination of the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) to provide, or the provision of, a Superior Proposal Notice
or an Intervening Event Notice in compliance with the terms of this Agreement
will not, in and of itself, be deemed a Change of Recommendation.

 

(c) _Certain Permitted Changes of Recommendation_. Subject to _Section_ _ _
_6.9(d)_ , at any time prior to receiving the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board may effect, or cause the Company to effect, as the case may
be, a Change of Recommendation if: (i) the Company Board determines (A) that
after complying with  _Section_ _ _ _6.9(d)(i)_ , a Bona Fide Alternative
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) after complying with _Section_
_ _ _6.9(d)(ii)_ , an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and
(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith,

 



43  after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that, in
light of such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as the case may be, (A)
the Transactions are not in the best interests of the Companys stockholders
and (B) the failure to effect such Change of Recommendation would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties or
obligations under applicable Law.

 

(d) _Procedure Prior to Change of Recommendation_.

 

(i) The Company Board will be entitled to effect, or cause the Company to
effect, prior to receiving the Company Stockholder Approval, a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal (to the extent permitted
under _Section_ _ _ _6.9(c)_ ), only if (A) the Company has delivered to
Parent a written notice (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") (1) stating that
the Company Board intends to take such actions pursuant to _Section_ _ _
_6.9(c)_ , (2) stating that the Company Board has made the determinations set
forth in  _Section_ _ _ _6.9(c)(i)(A)_ and _Section_ _ _ _6.9(c)(ii)_ and (3)
including an unredacted copy of such Superior Proposal and an unredacted form
of any proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement related to such Superior
Proposal (including any materials relating to such Persons proposed equity
and debt financing, if any) and (B) the Negotiation Period has expired. During
the four Business Day period commencing on the date of Parents receipt of
such Superior Proposal Notice (such period, as may be extended pursuant to
this _Section_ _ _ _6.9(d)(i)_ , the " _Negotiation Period_ "), the Company
will engage, and will cause its Representatives to be available for the
purpose of engaging, in good faith negotiations with Parent (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) regarding an amendment of this Agreement so that
the Alternative Proposal that is the subject of the Superior Proposal
Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal. Each time the financial or other
material terms or conditions of such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal (or terms
or conditions related thereto, such as the proposed equity and debt financing)
are amended or modified, the Company will be required to deliver to Parent a
new Superior Proposal Notice (including, as attachments thereto, amended forms
of the written Alternative Acquisition Agreements relating to such Bona Fide
Alternative Proposal) and the Negotiation Period will be extended by an
additional two Business Days from the date of Parents receipt of such new
Superior Proposal Notice.

 

(ii) The Company Board will be entitled to effect, or cause the Company to
effect, a Change of Recommendation in connection with an Intervening Event
(to the extent permitted under _Section_ _ _ _6.9(c)_ ), only if (A) the
Company has delivered to Parent a written notice (an " _Intervening Event
Notice_ ") (1) stating that the Company Board intends to take such actions
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _6.9(c)_ , (2) stating that the Company Board has
made the determinations set forth in _Sections_ _ _ _6.9(c)(i)(B)_ and
_6.9(c)(ii)_ and (3) including a summary, in all material respects, of the
Intervening Event and (B) the Intervening Event Negotiation Period has
expired. During the four Business Day period commencing on the date of
Parents receipt of such Intervening Event Notice (such period, as may be
extended pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _6.9(d)(ii)_ , the

 



44  " _Intervening Event Negotiation Period_ "), the Company will engage, and
will cause its Representatives to be available for the purpose of engaging, in
good faith negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) regarding an amendment of this Agreement so that the Company Board
would no longer be permitted to take such actions pursuant to _Section_ _ _
_6.9(c)_. Each time there is a material change to the facts or circumstances
relating to the Intervening Event, the Company will be required to deliver to
Parent a new Intervening Event Notice (including, as attachments thereto, a
summary of the changes to the facts and circumstances relating to the
Intervening Event) and the Intervening Event Negotiation Period will be
extended by an additional two Business Days from the date of Parents receipt
of such new Intervening Event Notice.

 

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section_ _ _
_6.9_ will be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, and in no event will any such "stop, look and listen"
communication contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act be deemed
to be a Change of Recommendation or to violate this  _Section_ _ _ _6.9_ or
(ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties or obligations under applicable Law, except that any such position or
disclosure contemplated by this clause _(ii)_ will be deemed a Change of
Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly and concurrently reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation.

(f) _Existing Discussions_. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with, or any solicitation or
intentional assistance or encouragement of, any Person with respect to
any Alternative Proposal (or that could reasonably be expected to lead to or
result in an Alternative Proposal) which are on-going as of the date of this
Agreement and request that any such Person promptly return and destroy (and
confirm destruction of) all confidential information concerning the Company.
The Company will take the necessary steps to promptly inform, on the date of
this Agreement, the individuals or entities referred to in the preceding
sentence of this  _Section_ _ _ _6.9(f)_.

(g) _Notice_. Without limiting anything in this  _Section_ _ _ _6.9_ , the
Company will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent
orally and in writing if (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect
to an Alternative Proposal or requests for non-public information relating to
any of the Company (other than requests for information in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice and unrelated to an Alternative
Proposal) are received by, or any discussions or negotiations with respect to
an Alternative Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Company or any of its respective Representatives, indicating, in connection
with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions of such

 



45  discussions, proposals, offers or requests, and including in the written
version of such notice, an unredacted copy of any written (including via
electronic transmission) inquiries, proposals, offers or requests, in each
case, including any amendments or modifications thereto or (ii) any events or
circumstances occur that have caused, or would reasonably be expected to
cause, an Intervening Event, including any material changes in any such
events or circumstances. The Company will promptly (and, in any event, within
24 hours after any amendment or modification of, or development with respect
to, any such inquiry, proposal, offer, request or Alternative Proposal, or at
the reasonable request of Parent) notify Parent orally and in writing of the
status of any such inquiries, proposals, offers or requests, including any
developments, notifications, amendments or modifications thereto and furnish
to Parent unredacted copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and
draft documentation in connection with such discussions, proposals, offers or
requests. The Company will not, and will cause its respective Subsidiaries and
Representatives not to, enter into any Contract that would prohibit the
Company from providing the information required to be provided to Parent
pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _6.9(g)_.

 

Section 6.10 _Control of the Company_ __ _s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement will give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and the Company Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 6.11 _Subsidiary Compliance_. Parent will cause Merger Sub to comply
with and perform all of Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this

connection with the Merger.

Section 6.12 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company will give Parent prompt
notice of any Action commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, against the Company or its directors, officers, managers, partners
or Affiliates relating to this Agreement or the Merger (collectively, "
_Transaction Litigation_ "). The Company will consult with Parent regarding
the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and will not
compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise,
settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or
consent to the same, without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In
connection with any Transaction Litigation and the Parties performance of
their obligations under this _Section_ _ _ _6.12_ , the Parties will enter
into a customary common interest or joint defense agreement or implement such
other techniques as reasonably required to preserve any attorney-client
privilege or other applicable legal privilege; except that the Company will
not be required to provide information if doing so, in the opinion of the
Companys legal counsel, would cause the loss of any attorney-client
privilege or other applicable legal privilege; except that, if any information
is withheld pursuant to the foregoing exception, the Company will inform
Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the Parties
will use reasonable best efforts to enable the Company to provide such
information without causing the loss of any attorney-client or other
applicable legal privilege.

 



46 Section 6.13 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement will be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Following such initial press release,
none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub will, and neither the Company nor
Parent will permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication
of any press release or similar public announcement with respect to, the
Transactions without the prior consent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) of Parent, in the case of a proposed
announcement by the Company, or the Company, in the case of a proposed
announcement by Parent or Merger Sub; except that either Party may, without
the prior consent of the other Party (but after prior consultation with
the other Party to the extent practicable under the circumstances) issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement to the
extent such Party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law or
by the rules and regulations of the NYSE. The restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ _ _ _6.13_ will not apply to any release or public statement (a)
made or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with an Alternative
Proposal or a Superior Proposal or any action taken pursuant thereto or (b)
in connection with any dispute between the Parties regarding this Agreement or
the Transactions; except that the foregoing will not limit the ability of any
Party hereto to make internal announcements to their respective employees and
other stockholders that are not inconsistent in any material respects with the
prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions.

 

Section 6.14 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable
to the Transactions, the Company, including the Company Board, will grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and the Parties will otherwise act to irrevocably eliminate
the effects of such Takeover Law on the Merger.

Section 6.15 _Credit Agreement Waiver and Other Agreements_. Prior to the
date of this Agreement, the Company will have (a) obtained a waiver from the
lenders under the Credit Agreement providing that the entry into this
Agreement will not constitute an event of default for purposes of the Credit
Agreement and (b) entered into the agreements set forth in _Section_ _ _

_8.1(b)(iii)_ at a time when this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(d)(ii)_ , then the Company will pay Parent the

perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement (but not if due

termination an Alternative Proposal has been made to the Company or has
otherwise been publicly announced, or a Person will have publicly announced an
intention to make an Alternative Proposal, (2) by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(b)(i)_ at a time when (x) this Agreement was
terminable by Parent pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(c)(i)_ , if due to the
Companys failure to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement (but not if due to any breach or failure to be true of any of the
representations or warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement) or
(y) the Company Stockholder Approval was not obtained due to the Company
Stockholders Meeting not being held or completed, and in each case prior to
such termination an Alternative Proposal has been

 



51  made to the Company or has otherwise been publicly announced, or a Person
will have publicly announced an intention to make an Alternative Proposal, or
(3) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(b)(iii)_ , and

Company will pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent upon the earlier of (x)
the consummation of such Alternative Proposal and (y) entry into such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds; except that the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to this
_Section_ _ _ _8.2(b)(iii)_ will be reduced by the Expense Reimbursement, if
any, actually paid to Parent pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _8.2(c)_. For
purposes of this _Section_ _ _ _8.2(b)(iii)_ (including for purposes of the
definition of Alternative Acquisition Agreement, references to " _10% or more_

to " _more than 50%._ "

by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1(b)(iii)_ (but not to
the extent _Section_ _ _ _8.2(b)(i)(C)_ is applicable), then the Company will
pay to Parent its and its Affiliates reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and
expenses incurred in connection with their investigation, consideration,

transfer of immediately available funds; except that the Expense Reimbursement
will not exceed $1,000,000 and the Company will not be obligated to reimburse
Parent for any internal cost allocations or charges among its Affiliates.
Provided that the Company has not breached its obligations under this
Agreement in any material respect, the Expense Reimbursement will be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent or Merger Sub against the Company for a
termination of the Agreement in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _8.1(b)(iii)_ ,
other than the payment of the Company Termination Fee to the extent it is or
otherwise becomes payable pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.2(b)_. In the event the
Expense Reimbursement is paid and a Company Termination Fee is thereafter
payable pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _8.2(b)_ , the Company Termination Fee
otherwise payable will be reduced by the amount of the Expense Reimbursement.

 

(d) _Collection Fees and Expenses_. Each Party acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this  _Section_ _ _ _8.2_ are an integral part of the

this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount
due under this  _Section_ _ _ _8.2_ , and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences an Action that results in an Order against the Company, the
Company will pay to Parent the costs and expenses (including attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such Action and will pay interest on the
amount payable pursuant to such Order, compounded quarterly, at the prime
lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street_
 

 



52   _Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were
required to be paid (but for such Action) until the date of actual payment. In
no event will the Company be obligated to pay more than one Company
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _8.2_.

(e) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Provided that the Company has not willfully
breached in any material respect its obligations under (i) _Section_ _ _ _6.9_

in a failure to hold or complete the Company Stockholders Meeting or a failure
to file or mail the Proxy Statement, in the event that the Company Termination
Fee is paid by the Company to Parent in accordance with this  _Section_ _ _
_8.2_ , such payment will be the sole and exclusive remedy at law of Parent
and Merger Sub against the Company for any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, fees, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements), judgments, inquiries and fines suffered as a result of any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement by the Company; except that the foregoing will not impair the
rights of Parent to obtain injunctive relief pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _9.12_
prior to any termination of this Agreement. Solely for purposes of this

Section 9.3 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits
or Disclosure Letters, such reference will be to an Article or Section of or
Exhibit or Disclosure Letter to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Unless the context otherwise requires, (i) "or" is
disjunctive but not necessarily exclusive, (ii) words in the singular include
the plural and vice versa, and (iii) the use in this Agreement of a pronoun in
reference to a Party hereto includes the masculine, feminine or neuter, as
the context may require. The Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure
Letter as well as all other schedules and all exhibits hereto, will be deemed
part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. The
representations and warranties of Parent and the Company are made and given,
and the covenants are agreed to, subject to the disclosures and exceptions set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter and Parent 

 



54  Disclosure Letter. In no event will the listing of any matter in the Company
Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to
expand the scope of the respective Partys representations, warranties and/or
covenants set forth in this Agreement. All attachments to the Company
Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are incorporated by reference
into the Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter,
respectively, in which they are directly or indirectly referenced.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion
of an item therein as an exception to a representation or warranty will not
be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

(b) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

Section 9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and
will become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Party, it being understood that each Party
need not sign the same counterpart.

 

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and the instruments referred to in this Agreement),
together with the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire
agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement, (b) is not intended to confer on any Person, other than the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any
rights or remedies hereunder, except for (i) the rights of the Companys
stockholders and holders of the Company Stock Awards to receive the Merger
Consideration and related consideration, respectively, at the Effective Time

Agreement may be amended by the Company and Parent (on behalf of itself and
Merger Sub), by action taken or authorized by the Company Board and by the
Parent Board, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented
in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, except that,
after any approval of the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company,
there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any
amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the
consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Shares,
other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

 



55 Section 9.7 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the

obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this

such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion
hereof that reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be
delivered to the holders of Shares under this Agreement, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
Contracts made and wholly performed within such state, without regard to any

for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware) (such courts, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence
any such action or proceeding except in the Chosen Courts, (ii) agrees that
any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in the Chosen Courts, and any appellate court hearing actions or
proceedings therefrom, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, and
(iv) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding will be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,

56 Section 9.10 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as expressly provided in this

incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions will be paid

Section 9.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned by any of the Parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties and any attempt to do so will be null and void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns.

Section 9.12  _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that
immediate, extensive and irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do
not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties will be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity, to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the obligation of the
Parties hereto to consummate the Merger and the obligation of Parent and
Merger Sub to pay, and the Companys stockholders right to receive, the
Merger Consideration payable to them pursuant to the Merger, in each case in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement) in
the Chosen Courts without proof of damages or otherwise, and that such
explicit rights of specific enforcement are an integral part of the
Transactions and, without such rights, neither the Company nor Parent would
have entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties hereto have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity.

 



57  The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

Section 9.13  _Waivers_. Any failure of any of the Parties hereto to comply
with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by
the Party or Parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written
instrument signed by the Party granting such waiver, but such waiver or
failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 

Section 9.14 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable, such term, provision, covenant
or restriction will be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render
it valid, effective and enforceable, and the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement will remain
in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated.

[ _attached_ ] AMENDED AND RESTATED

OF

POWERSECURE INTERNATIONAL, INC.

I.

 

The name of the corporation is PowerSecure International, Inc. (the
"Corporation").

 

II.

The initial registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware
shall be located at 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, New Castle
County, Delaware 19808. The initial registered agent of the Corporation at
such address shall be Corporation Service Company.

III.

 

The purpose or purposes for which the Corporation is organized shall be to
engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

IV.

 

The Corporation shall be authorized to issue 100 shares of $0.01 par value
capital stock, all of which shall be designated "Common Stock." The shares of
Common Stock shall have unlimited voting rights and shall be entitled to
receive all of the net assets of the Corporation upon dissolution or
liquidation.

 

V.

The Corporation shall have perpetual duration.

VI.

 

The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the power to adopt, amend
and repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 

VII.

A. The corporation may indemnify or agree to indemnify any person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending, or
completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of
the corporation, by reason of the fact he is or was a director, officer,
employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as a director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent of
another corporation (including a subsidiary of this corporation), domestic or
foreign, nonprofit or for profit, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines,
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with such action, suit, or  proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself create a presumption that
the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he had reasonable cause
to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

B. The corporation may indemnify or agree to indemnify any person who was or
is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending,
or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director,
officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the corporation as a director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent
of another corporation (including a subsidiary of this corporation), domestic
or foreign, nonprofit or for profit, partnership, joint venture, trust, or
other enterprise against expenses, including attorneys fees, actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation,
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect to any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to
the corporation unless, and only to the extent that, the Court of Chancery,
or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled
to indemnity for such expenses as the Court of Chancery or other such court
shall deem proper.

 

C. To the extent that a director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent has
been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or
proceeding referred to in sections A. and B. of this Article, or in defense of
any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses,
including attorneys fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him
in connection therewith.

D. Any indemnification under sections A. and B. of this Article, unless
ordered by a court, shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in
the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director,
trustee, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because he
has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in sections A. and B. of
this Article. Such determination shall be made (1) by a majority vote of a
quorum consisting of directors of the indemnifying corporation who were not
and are not parties to or threatened with any such action, suit,
or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable or if a majority
vote of a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, in a written opinion
by independent legal counsel other than an attorney, or a firm having
associated with it an attorney, who has been retained by or who has performed
services for the corporation or any person to be indemnified within the past
five years, or (3) by the stockholders, or (4) by the Court of Chancery or the
court in which such action, suit, or proceeding was brought. Any
determination made by the disinterested directors under section D.(1) or by
independent legal counsel under section D.(2) of this Article shall be
promptly communicated to the person who threatened or 

 



-2-  brought the action or suit by or in the right of the corporation under
section B. of this Article, and within ten days after receipt of such
notification, such person shall have the right to petition the Court of
Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought to review the
reasonableness of such determination.

 

E. No director of the corporation shall be personally liable to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (1) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (2) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or
knowing violation of law; (3) under Section 174 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware; or (4) for any transaction from which the
director derived an improper personal benefit.

 

F. Expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred in any action, suit, or
proceeding referred to in sections A. and B. of this Article, may be paid by
the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or
proceedings upon receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the
director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent to repay such amount, if it
shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by
the corporation as authorized in this Article. If a majority vote of a quorum
of disinterested directors so directs by resolution, said written undertaking
need not be submitted to the corporation. Such a determination that a written
undertaking need not be submitted to the corporation shall in no way affect
the entitlement of indemnification as authorized by this Article.

 

G. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided in this Article
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the bylaws or
any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise,
both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office.

H. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or
is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, trustee,
officer, employee, or agent of another corporation (including a subsidiary of
this corporation), domestic or foreign, nonprofit or for profit, partnership,
joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against him and incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his
status as such whether or not the corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under this Article.

I. For purposes of this Article, references to "the corporation" shall
include, in addition to the resulting corporation, the Corporation, any
constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed
in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued,
would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and
employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee, or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee,
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this
Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would
have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence
had continued.

 



-3- J. For purposes of this Article, references to "other enterprises" shall
include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan;
and references to "serving at the request of the corporation" shall include
any service as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation
which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer,
employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants,
or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to
in this Article.

K. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.
