Surviving Corporation common stock into which such shares of Merger Sub
common stock shall have been converted. Promptly after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall issue to Parent a stock certificate
representing 100 shares of Surviving Corporation common stock in exchange for
the certificate that formerly represented shares of Merger Sub common
stock, which shall be surrendered by Parent and canceled.   SECTION 3.02
Exchange of Shares Other than Dissenting Shares and Treasury Shares.   (a)
Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to
act as exchange agent for the Merger (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") as may be
designated by Parent.   (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock and Cash.
Following the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock: (i) Certificates of Parent Common Shares ("PARENT
CERTIFICATES") representing the number of whole Parent Common Shares issuable
pursuant to Section 3.01(a) in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time; (ii) other evidences of the ownership of the underlying Parent Common
Shares; and (iii) sufficient funds to permit payment in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 3.04.   (c) Exchange Procedures. The Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of certificates of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock ("COMPANY CERTIFICATES"), whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Parent Common Shares (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.04) promptly after the Effective
Time: (i) a form letter of transmittal in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Company (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon
receipt of the Company Certificates by the Exchange Agent, and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify);
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company
Certificates in exchange for Parent Certificates (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares). Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal and
Stockholder Representation Letter, duly completed and validly executed, and
such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a Parent Certificate representing the number of whole
Parent Common Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this Article III and payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.04, and the
Company Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until
so surrendered, each outstanding Company Certificate that, prior to
the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time
to evidence the right to receive the number of full Parent Common Shares
into which such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock,
as the case may be, shall have been so converted and the right to receive
an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares
in accordance with Section 3.04. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, no interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
to holders of Company Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III.   (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect to the Parent Common
Shares represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company
Certificate shall surrender such Company Certificate and any underlying
Shares. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws,
following surrender of any such Company Certificate, there shall be paid to
the record holder of the Parent Certificates issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any such
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section 3.02(d)) with
respect to such Parent Common Shares.   (e) Transfer of Ownership. If any
Parent Certificate is to be issued in a name, or cash in lieu of fractional
shares paid to a Person, other than that in which the Company Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance and/or payment thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered
will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any
agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a Parent Certificate for Parent Common Shares in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the Company Certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f)
Termination of Exchange Agent Funding. Any portion of funds (including any
interest earned thereon) or Parent Certificates held by the Exchange Agent
which have not been delivered to holders of Company Certificates pursuant to
this Article III within six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
promptly be paid or delivered, as appropriate, to Parent, and thereafter
holders of Company Certificates who have not theretofore complied with the
exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by this Section 3.02 shall
thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar laws) only as general creditors thereof for their claim for Parent
Common Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares and any
dividends or distributions (with a record date after the Effective Time) with
respect to Parent Common Shares to which they are entitled.   (g) No
Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.02,
none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Common Shares or cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.   SECTION 3.03 Stock Transfer Books. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall each be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock thereafter on the records of any such
stock transfer books. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that is not registered
in the stock transfer records of Company at the Effective Time, a
certificate or certificates representing the number of full Parent Common
Shares into which such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, shall have been converted shall be issued to
the transferee together with a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares,
if any, in accordance with Section 3.04 hereof, and a cash payment in
the amount of dividends, if any, in accordance with Section 3.02(d) hereof,
if the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as the case may be, is or are
surrendered as provided in Section 3.02(c) hereof, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence of
payment of any applicable stock transfer tax.   SECTION 3.04 No Fractional
Share Certificates. No scrip or fractional share Parent Certificate shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates, and an
outstanding fractional share interest shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote, to receive dividends or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent or of
Surviving Corporation with respect to such fractional share interest. As
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent an amount in cash sufficient for the Exchange Agent
to pay each holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock an
amount in cash, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held at the Effective Time by
such holder) by (ii) the Final Average Closing Price. As soon as practicable
after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock with respect to
any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available
such amounts, net of any required withholding taxes, to such holders of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, subject to and in accordance
with the terms of Section 3.02 hereof.   SECTION 3.05 Options to Purchase
Company Common Stock.   (a) At the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plan
and each option granted by Company to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Company Stock Plan or otherwise listed on Schedule 3.05
of the Company Disclosure Schedule ("COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS") which
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and each warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
("COMPANY WARRANTS") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be
automatically converted into an option or warrant, as the case may be, to
purchase Parent Common Shares in such number and at such exercise price as
provided below and otherwise having the same terms and conditions as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent that
such terms, conditions and restrictions are automatically altered in
accordance with their terms as a result of the Merger contemplated hereby and
except that all references in each such Company Stock Option or Company
Warrant to Company shall be deemed to refer to Parent):   (i) the number of
Parent Common Shares to be subject to the  new option or warrant, as the case
may be, shall be equal to the  product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock  subject to the original Company Stock Option or Company
Warrant  immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange 
Ratio;   (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Shares  under
the new option or warrant shall be equal to (x) the exercise  price per share
of Company Common Stock in effect under the  original Company Stock Option or
Company Warrant immediately prior  to the Effective Time divided by (y) the
Exchange Ratio; and   (iii) in effecting such assumption and conversion,
the  aggregate number of Parent Common Shares to be subject to each  assumed
Company Stock Option or Company Warrant will be rounded  down, if necessary,
to the next whole share and the aggregate  exercise price shall be rounded
up, if necessary, to the next  whole cent.   (b) The adjustments provided
herein with respect to any options that are "incentive stock options" (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.   (c) Prior to the
Effective Time, Company shall take all actions required to be taken by it to
implement the provisions of this Section 3.05, including reasonable efforts
to obtain any consents required to effect the rollover of Company Stock
Options which have terms that do not automatically provide for such rollover
and, except as set forth on Schedule 3.05(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no further action or consent shall be required on behalf of Company
or any holder of a Company Stock Option or Company Warrant. Without
limitation of the previous sentence, except as set forth on Schedule 3.05(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, following the Effective Time, no holder
of a Company Stock Option or a Company Warrant shall have any rights to
acquire Company Common Stock and no Person shall have any rights to acquire
shares of any Company Subsidiary. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
take all actions required to be taken by it prior to the Effective Time to
implement the provisions of this Section 3.05.   SECTION 3.06 Certain
Adjustments. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding Parent Common Shares, Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange
of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities shall be
declared thereon with a record date within such period, then each Exchange
Ratio established pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.01 shall be
adjusted accordingly to provide to Parent and Company the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or dividend.   SECTION
3.07 Dissenters\' Rights. Any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into,
or be exchangeable for, the right to receive Parent Common Shares but shall
instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Delaware Law unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his right of appraisal and payment,
as the case may be. Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any Dissenting
Shares (and shall also give Parent prompt notice of any withdrawals of such
demands for appraisal rights) and Parent shall have the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Neither Company
nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payments with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for appraisal rights and any such payment will be
made by Company out of funds of Company. If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, Parent shall
issue and deliver, upon surrender by such stockholder of certificate or
certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock, the number of
Parent Common Shares to which such stockholder would otherwise be entitled
pursuant to this Article III (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 3.04).   SECTION 3.08 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In
the event any Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the holder thereof, such Parent Common Shares (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares) as may be required pursuant to Section 3.01, provided,
however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificates to indemnify Parent against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
with respect to the Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.   SECTION 3.09 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action.
If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company,
the officers and directors of Company are fully authorized in the name of
their corporation or otherwise to take, and will use good faith efforts to
take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is
not inconsistent with this Agreement.    ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Merger Sub, subject to the exceptions specifically disclosed in writing

incorporation or organization, as the case may be, and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Company and each Company
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing (to the extent applicable), in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Schedule 4.01 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and complete
list of each Company Subsidiary, together with the jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization of each Company Subsidiary and the percentage
of each Company Subsidiary\'s outstanding capital stock or other equity

Company Subsidiary has properly filed all reports, resolutions and other

file or deliver such reports, resolutions and other documents would not have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.03 Capitalization. The
authorized capital stock of Company consists of 60,000,000 shares of Company
Common Stock and 11,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock, of which
4,676,986 shares have been designated as Class B Preferred Stock and

options. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.03(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no options, warrants, calls, pre-emptive rights,

any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, Company or any Company Subsidiary or

conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock have

other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting or disposition of the

delivery of this Agreement by Company do not, and the performance by Company
of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing by
Company with or notification by Company to, any Governmental Entity, except

listings, permits, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity necessary
for Company or any Company Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets or otherwise to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, other than those, the failure of which to possess, could
not reasonably be expected to have, individually, or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the "COMPANY PERMITS"),
and, as of the date of this Agreement, none of the Company Permits has
been suspended or cancelled nor is any such suspension or cancellation
pending or, to the Knowledge of Company, threatened which, in either

Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any Law
applicable to Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or
asset of Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except for
such conflicts, defaults or violations which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, or (ii) any Company Permits, except for such conflicts,
defaults or violations that could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Schedule

Agreement, all actions, proceedings, to the Knowledge of Company
investigations or surveys pending or, to the Knowledge of Company, threatened
against Company or any Company Subsidiary that could reasonably be expected
to result in the suspension or cancellation of any Company Permit. Since
January 1, 2000, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received from
any Governmental Entity any written notification with respect to
possible conflicts, defaults or violations of Laws, except for any such
notice with respect to possible conflicts, defaults or violations which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.07 Financial Statements.

mortgage, pledge or the institution of any lien, encumbrance or charge on
any material assets or properties, tangible or intangible, except for liens

Material Adverse Effect, or (z) waiver of any rights of material value

2000, Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses
only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and, since such
date, there has not been (i) any Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any

expected to result in a loss, impairment, or diminution in value on a going
forward basis of the Company\'s contractual and business relationships with
any of the customers, vendors and suppliers, whose names are set forth on
Schedule 4.24 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, other than any
impairment modification or event which could not reasonably be expected to

4.09 Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters.   (a) The term "Company Benefit
Plans" shall mean all employee benefit and compensation plans, programs,
policies, arrangements and contracts (including, without limitation, any
"employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) covering
current or former employees or current or former directors of Company or any
Company Subsidiary and which are maintained, sponsored or contributed to, or
required to be contributed to, by Company or any Company Subsidiary or to
which Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party. Company has delivered or
made available to Parent upon request a true, complete and correct copy of
each (i) material Company Benefit Plan and the most recent summary plan
description related to such Company Benefit Plan, if a summary plan
description is required therefor and (ii) each trust agreement or other
funding arrangement relating to such material Company Benefit Plan. Neither
Company nor any Company Affiliate has any express or implied commitment,
whether legally enforceable or not, to modify, change or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or
termination required by ERISA, the Code or applicable local Law.   (b) Each
Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and all applicable laws, including, without
limitation, ERISA and the Code, if applicable, and all contributions required
to be made under the terms of any of the Company Benefit Plans have been
timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance
sheet. With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and,
to the Knowledge of Company, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate
could be subject to any material liability (other than for routine claims for
benefits) under the terms of such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable Law.   (c) Company hereby represents that: (i) each
Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has received or is currently
awaiting receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its
qualified status under the Code, and each trust established in connection
with any Company which is intended to be exempt from United States federal
income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a determination
letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and to the Knowledge of Company no
fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination letter from
the IRS to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit
Plan or the exempt status of any such trust; (ii) there has been no
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan which could result
in material liability to Company; (iii) each Company Benefit Plan can
be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time
in accordance with its terms. No suit, administrative proceeding, action
or other litigation has been brought (other than routine benefit claims),
or to the Knowledge of Company is threatened in writing, against or
with respect to any such Company Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry
by the Internal Revenue Service or United States Department of Labor or
any comparable Governmental Entity.   (d) No Company Benefit Plan or
employee benefit plan maintained by a trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) treated as a single employer with the Company (a "COMPANY ERISA
AFFILIATE") under Section 414(a), (b), (m) or (o) of the Code is a
multiemployer pension plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or other
pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Part 3 of Title I of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, and neither the Company nor any Company ERISA
Affiliate has sponsored or contributed to or been required to contribute to a
multiemployer pension plan or other pension plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA. No material liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by
Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full,
and no condition exists that presents a material risk to Company or any
Company ERISA Affiliate of incurring or being subject (whether primarily,
jointly or secondarily) to a material liability thereunder. None of the
assets of Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate is, or may reasonably be
expected to become, the subject of any lien arising under ERISA or Section
412(n) of the Code.   (e) Company has scheduled on Schedule 4.09(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and has delivered to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of (i) all employment agreements with the ten (10)
most highly-compensated employees of Company, and with the Chief
Executive Officer of each Company Subsidiary and (ii) all material severance
plans, agreements, programs and policies of Company and each Company
Subsidiary with or relating to their respective employees, directors or
consultants. No payment or benefit which will be made by Company or any
Company Subsidiary under any Company Benefit Plan or other arrangement
will constitute an excess parachute payment under Code Section 280G(b)(1),
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not individually or in conjunction with any other possible event
(including termination of employment) (i) entitle any current or former
employee or other service provider of Company or any Company Subsidiary to
severance benefits or any other payment, compensation or benefit
(including forgiveness of indebtedness), except as expressly provided by
this Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of compensation or benefit due any such employee or
service provider or trigger any other material liability of Company pursuant
to any Company Benefit Plan. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not result in the accelerated vesting of Company Stock Options or
Company Warrants or be considered a "change of control" for purposes of any
change of control provision contained in any employment agreement listed
on Schedule 4.09(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (f) Neither
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining or
other labor union contract applicable to Persons employed by Company or any
Company Subsidiary and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated
by Company or any Company Subsidiary. As of the date of this Agreement, there
is no labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against Company or any Company
Subsidiary pending or, to the Knowledge of Company, threatened in writing
which may interfere with the respective business activities of Company or any
Company Subsidiary. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of
Company, none of Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective
representatives or employees has committed any unfair labor practice in
connection with the operation of the respective businesses of Company or any
Company Subsidiary, and there is no charge or complaint against Company or
any Company Subsidiary by the National Labor Relations Board or any
comparable Governmental Entity or works council pending or threatened in
writing.   (g) Except as required by Law, no Company Benefit Plan
provides retiree or post-employment, medical, disability or life insurance
benefits to any Person.   (h) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan
that is not subject to United States law (each, a "COMPANY FOREIGN BENEFIT
PLAN");   (i) all employer and employee contributions to each Company 
Foreign Benefit Plan required by law or by the terms of such Company  Foreign
Benefit Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued, in  accordance with
normal accounting practices;   (ii) the fair market value of the assets of
each funded Company  Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer of
any Company  Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book
reserve  established for any Company Foreign Benefit Plan, together with
the  accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the 
accrued benefit obligations, as of the Effective Time, with respect to  all
current and former participants in such plan according to the  actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine  employer
contributions to such Company Foreign Benefit Plan and no  transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or  insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and   (iii) each
Company Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered  has been registered
and has been maintained in good standing with  applicable regulatory
authorities.   SECTION 4.10 Pooling; Certain Tax Matters. Neither Company
nor, to the Knowledge of Company, any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed
to take any action (other than actions contemplated by this Agreement) that
could reasonably be expected to prevent (a) the Merger from being treated
for accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests" in accordance with
U.S. GAAP and the accounting standards of the SEC or (b) the Merger
from constituting a "reorganization" under Section 368 of the Code. Company
is not aware of any agreement or plan to which Company or any of
its Affiliates is a party or other circumstances relating to Company or any
of its Affiliates that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
from being so treated as a "pooling of interests" or from so qualifying as
a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.   SECTION 4.11

in Schedule 4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively,
the "COMPANY MATERIAL CONTRACTS"), neither Company nor the Company

excess of $1,000,000 entered into in the  last three years.   (b) Company

the Knowledge of Company, is not alleged to be in default in respect of any
Company Material Contract. Each of the Company Material Contracts is in full
force and effect, unamended, and there exists no default or event of default
or event, occurrence, condition or act, with respect to Company or any
Company Subsidiary or to the Knowledge of Company with respect to the other
contracting party, which, with the giving of notice, the lapse of the time or
the happening of any other event or conditions, would become a default or
event of default under any Company Material Contract. True, correct and
complete copies of all Company Material Contracts have been delivered or made
available to Parent.   SECTION 4.12 Litigation. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.12 to Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, claim,
action, proceeding or, to the Knowledge of Company, investigation pending or,
to the Knowledge of Company, threatened against Company or any Company
Subsidiary that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or materially interfere with
Company\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein,
including, without limitation, any pending or threatened class action suit.
Neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding
order, writ, injunction or decree which could reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect

or otherwise enjoyed by Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to one or
more license agreements, each of which such license agreements are, to
the Knowledge of Company and each Company Subsidiary, valid and
enforceable.   (b) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, all intellectual property registrations included in the
Company Intellectual Property have been duly maintained, are in full force

"LICENSE AGREEMENTS") to which Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party
or otherwise bound are valid and binding obligations of the Company or
Company Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with their terms, and there

or constitute a default by the Company or Company Subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of Company, the other party thereto, under any such material
License Agreement.   (f) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries
takes reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets. To
the Knowledge of Company, no trade secret of the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries has been disclosed or authorized to be disclosed to any
Person other than pursuant to a written nondisclosure agreement that
provides commercially reasonable protections for Company and the applicable
Company Subsidiaries\' proprietary interests in and to such trade
secrets.   (g) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
result in the loss or impairment of the Company\'s or any Company
Subsidiaries\' rights to own, use, or to bring any action for the
infringement of, any of the Company Intellectual Property, nor will such
consummation require the consent of any Person in respect of any Company
Intellectual Property.   (h) Except as would not have a Company Material

each of the Company Subsidiaries, and any consolidated, combined, unitary or
aggregate group for Tax purposes of which Company or any Company Subsidiary
is or has been a member, have properly completed and timely filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed by them and have paid all Taxes required to be
shown as due thereon. Company has provided adequate accruals in accordance

481 or 263A of the Code or any comparable provision under state or foreign
Tax laws as a result of transactions, events or accounting methods employed
prior to the Merger.   (e) Neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has

any Company Subsidiary have any liability or potential liability to another
party under any such agreement.   (g) Neither Company nor any Company

Subsidiary is presently insured, and during each of the past three (3)

similar business would, in accordance with good business practice,
customarily be insured, including professional liability insurance. The

insurance maintained with respect to the assets or businesses of Company and
Company Subsidiaries provide, in the good faith judgment of the Company\'s
management, reasonably adequate coverage against loss. Company has heretofore
furnished to Parent a complete and correct list as of the date hereof of all
insurance policies maintained by Company or the Company Subsidiaries, and has
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of all such policies,

properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent
and each Parent Subsidiary, including Merger Sub, is duly qualified or

in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing that could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (b)
Schedule 5.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date of
this Agreement, a true and complete list of each Parent Subsidiary, together
with the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each Parent

other documents would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION

of 40,000,000 Parent Common Shares, 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock
("PARENT PREFERRED SHARES") and 100,000 shares of 10% cumulative

necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the

amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary pursuant to, any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation, except in the case of (ii) and (iii) above as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on Parent\'s ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub does not, and the
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing by Parent with or notification by
Parent to, any Governmental Entity, except pursuant to applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws, the
rules and regulations of the NNM, the premerger notification requirements of

grants, authorizations, licenses, establishment registrations, product
listings, permits, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity necessary
for Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets or otherwise to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, other than those, the failure of which to possess, could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually, or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the "PARENT PERMITS"), and, as of the
date of this Agreement, none of the Parent Permits has been suspended or
cancelled nor is any such suspension or cancellation pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing which could reasonably be expected

for such conflicts, defaults or violations that could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Schedule 5.06 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, all actions, proceedings, to the Knowledge of
Parent, investigations or surveys pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that

any material Parent Permit. Since January 1, 2000, neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary has received from any Governmental Entity any
written notification with respect to possible conflicts, defaults or
violations of Law, except for any such notice with respect to possible
conflicts, defaults, or violations which could not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 5.07 Absence of Certain

any dividend or distribution in respect of the Parent Common Shares or any

the ordinary course of business), (y) mortgage, pledge or the institution
of any lien, encumbrance or charge on any material assets or
properties, tangible or intangible, except for liens for Taxes not yet

(z) waiver of any rights of material value or cancellation or any material
debts or claims, or (viii) any entering into any transaction of a material
nature other than in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practices.   (b) Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 5.07 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, since June 30, 2000, Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice and, since such date, there has not been
(i) any Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any incurrence of any
damage, destruction or similar loss, whether or not covered by
insurance, materially affecting the business or properties of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, (iii) any incurrence of any material liability (absolute
or contingent), except for current liabilities and obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, or (iv)
any impairment, modification or event, or notice of any pending or
threatened impairment, modification or event which could be reasonably
expected to result in a loss, impairment, or diminution in value on a going
forward basis of Parent\'s contractual and business relationships with any of
the customers, vendors and suppliers, whose names are set forth on
Schedule 5.07(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, other than any
impairment modification or event which could not reasonably be expected to
result in a loss of Parent\'s relationship with such customer, vendor or
supplier or a loss of a material amount of business or a material change in
profit margins with respect to such customer, vendor or supplier.   SECTION
5.08 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.   (a) Parent has filed all forms,
reports, statements and documents required to be filed by it (A) with the SEC
and the NNM since March 2, 1998 (collectively, together with any such forms,
reports, statements and documents Parent may file subsequent to the date
hereof until the Closing, the "PARENT REPORTS") and (B) with any other
Governmental Entities. Each Parent Report (i) was prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the NNM, as the
case may be, and (ii) did not at the time it was filed contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Each form, report, statement and document referred to in clause (B) of this
paragraph was prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of applicable Law. No Parent Subsidiary is subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or required to file any
form, report or other document with the SEC, the NNM, any other stock
exchange or any other comparable Governmental Entity.   (b) Each of the
consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any notes
thereto) contained in the Parent Reports was, and, in the case of reports
filed after the date hereof (the "SUBSEQUENT REPORTS") will be, prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, for the absence of footnotes and subject to normal year end
adjustments, which adjustments are not material) applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto) and each presented, and in the case of Subsequent Reports,
will present, fairly and accurately the consolidated financial position of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof, and
their consolidated results of operations, stockholders\' equity and cash
flows for the respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and
recurring immaterial year-end adjustments).   (c) Except as and to the
extent set forth or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2000 as reported in the
Parent Reports, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise), except for (i) liabilities or obligations which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) liabilities or obligations which were
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since June 30, 2000.   SECTION 5.09 Employee Benefit Plans; Labor
Matters.   (a) The term "Parent Benefit Plans" means all employee benefit
and compensation plans, programs, policies, arrangements and
contracts (including, without limitation, any "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) covering current or former employees or
current or former directors of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary and which
are maintained, sponsored or contributed to, or required to be contributed
to, by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or to which Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary is a party. Parent has delivered or made available to
Company upon request a true, complete and correct copy of (i) each material
Parent Benefit Plan and the most recent summary plan description related to
such Parent Benefit Plan, if a summary plan description is required
therefor, (ii) each trust agreement or other funding arrangement relating to
such material Parent Benefit Plan, (iii) the most recent annual report
(Form 5500) filed with the IRS with respect to such material Parent Benefit
Plan, (iv) the most recent actuarial report or financial statement relating
to such material Parent Benefit Plan and (v) the most recent
determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to such material Parent
Benefit Plan, if intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.
Neither Parent nor any Parent Affiliate has any express or implied
commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, to modify, change or
terminate any Parent Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification,
change or termination required by ERISA, the Code or applicable local
Law.   (b) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and all applicable laws,
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code, if applicable, and
all contributions required to be made under the terms of any of the
Parent Benefit Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the
most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in
the Parent Reports. With respect to the Parent Benefit Plans, no event
has occurred and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there exists no condition or
set of circumstances in connection with which Parent or any Parent
ERISA Affiliate could be subject to any material liability (other than
for routine claims for benefits) under the terms of such Parent Benefit
Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law.   (c) Parent hereby
represents that: (i) each Parent Benefit Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has
received or is currently awaiting receipt of a favorable determination letter
from the IRS as to its qualified status under the Code, and each trust
established in connection with any Parent which is intended to be exempt from
United States federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has
received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and to the
Knowledge of Parent no fact or event has occurred since the date of such
determination letter from the IRS to adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Parent Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust; (ii)
there has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan
which could result in a material liability to Parent; (iii) each Parent
Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms. No suit, administrative
proceeding, action or other litigation has been brought (other than routine
benefit claims), or to the Knowledge of Parent is threatened in writing,
against or with respect to any such Parent Benefit Plan, including any audit
or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or United States Department of
Labor or any comparable Governmental Entity.   (d) No Parent Benefit Plan
or employee benefit plan maintained by any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) treated as a single employer with Parent (a "PARENT ERISA
AFFILIATE") under section 4.14(a), (b), (m) or (o) of the Code is a
multiemployer pension plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or other
pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Part 3 of Title I of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, and neither the Parent nor any Parent ERISA
Affiliate has sponsored or contributed to or been required to contribute to a
multiemployer pension plan or other pension plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA. No material liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by
Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and
no condition exists that presents a material risk to Parent or any Parent
ERISA Affiliate of incurring or being subject (whether primarily, jointly or
secondarily) to a material liability thereunder. None of the assets of Parent
or any Parent ERISA Affiliate is, or may reasonably be expected to become,
the subject of any lien arising under ERISA or Section 412(n) of the
Code.   (e) Parent has scheduled on Schedule 5.09(e) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule and has delivered to Company true, complete and
correct copies of (i) all employment agreements with the ten (10)
most highly-compensated employees of Parent, and with the Chief
Executive Officer of each Parent Subsidiary and (ii) all material severance
plans, agreements, programs and policies of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary
with or relating to their respective employees, directors or consultants.
Except as set forth in Schedule 5.09(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
which discloses the Parent\'s estimate of excess parachute payments based
on assumptions described therein, no payment or benefit which will be made
by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary under any Parent Benefit Plan or
other arrangement will constitute an excess parachute payment under Code
Section 280G(b)(1), and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not individually or in conjunction with any other
possible event (including termination of employment) (i) entitle any current
or former employee or other service provider of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to severance benefits or any other payment, compensation
or benefit (including forgiveness of indebtedness), except as
expressly provided by this Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment
or vesting, increase the amount of compensation or benefit due any
such employee or service provider, or trigger any other material liability
of Parent pursuant to any Parent Benefit Plan. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.09(e) to Parent Disclosure Schedule, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not result in the accelerated vesting of Parent
Stock Options or Parent Warrants.   (f) Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining or other labor union
contract applicable to Persons employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no labor
dispute, strike or work stoppage against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing which may
interfere with the respective business activities of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent,
none of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, or any of their respective
representatives or employees has committed any unfair labor practice in
connection with the operation of the respective businesses of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, and there is no charge or complaint against Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable
Governmental Entity or works council pending or threatened in writing.  
(g) Except as required by Law, no Parent Benefit Plan provides retiree or
post-employment medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any
Person.   (h) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is not
subject to United States law (each, a "PARENT FOREIGN BENEFIT PLAN");   (i)
all employer and employee contributions to each Parent  Foreign Benefit Plan
required by law or by the terms of such  Parent Foreign Benefit Plan have
been made, or, if applicable,  accrued, in accordance with normal accounting
practices;   (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded 
Parent Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any  Parent
Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book  reserve
established for any Parent Foreign Benefit Plan, together  with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or  provide for the accrued benefit
obligations, as of the Effective  Time, with respect to all current and
former participants in such  plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most  recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Parent  Foreign Benefit Plan and no transaction contemplated by this 
Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be  less than
such benefit obligations; and   (iii) each Parent Foreign Benefit Plan
required to be  registered has been registered and has been maintained in
good  standing with applicable regulatory authorities.   SECTION 5.10
Pooling; Certain Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent,
any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action (other than
actions contemplated by this Agreement) that could reasonably be expected to
prevent (a) the Merger from being treated for accounting purposes as a
"pooling of interests" in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the accounting
standards of the SEC or (b) the Merger from constituting a "reorganization"
under Section 368 of the Code. Parent is not aware of any agreement or plan
to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party or other circumstances
relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates that could reasonably be expected
to prevent the Merger from being so treated as a "pooling of interests" or
from so qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.  
SECTION 5.11 Contracts.   (a) Except for the contracts and agreements
described in Schedule 5.11 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (collectively,
the "PARENT MATERIAL CONTRACTS"), neither Parent nor the Parent Subsidiaries
is a party to or bound by the following contracts (which for purposes of this
Agreement shall be deemed Parent Material Contracts):   (i) any
distribution or software manufacturer\'s  representative contract that
represents ten percent (10%) or more  of Parent\'s combined annual
revenues;   (ii) any contract for the provision of software, outsourcing

time plus materials and fixed-price contracts involving  in the case of any
such contact more than $3,000,000 per annum;   (iii) any contract related to
the provision of services to  early-stage entities in consideration for,
among other things,  equity interests in such entities, along with any
subscription or  agreements with respect to investments in such entities
and  instruments or securities evidencing such equity interests,  including
any warrants or options;   (iv) any hedging arrangements, including any puts
or call  options;   (v) any trust indenture, mortgage, promissory note,
loan  agreement or other contract for the borrowing of money, any  currency
exchange, commodities or other hedging arrangement or any  leasing
transaction of the type required to be capitalized in  accordance with US
GAAP;   (vi) any contract for capital expenditures in excess of  $3,000,000
in the aggregate;   (vii) any contract limiting in any material respects
the  freedom of the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to engage in any  line
of business or to compete with any other Person;   (viii) any contract
pursuant to which the Parent or any  Parent Subsidiary is a lessor of any
machinery, equipment, motor  vehicles, office furniture, fixtures or other
personal property  involving in the case of any such contract more than
$3,000,000 in  any calendar year;   (ix) any contract with any Person
(other than the Parent or  any Parent Subsidiary) with whom the Parent or any
Parent  Subsidiary does not deal at arm\'s length within the meaning of the 
Code;   (x) any agreement of guarantee, support, indemnification, 
assumption or endorsement of, or any similar commitment with  respect to, the
obligations, liabilities (whether accrued,  absolute, contingent or
otherwise) or indebtedness of any other  Person; or   (xi) any agreement
relating to the acquisition of a business  for aggregate consideration in
excess of $1,000,000 entered into  in the last three years.   (b) Parent
and each Parent Subsidiary has performed all of the material obligations
required to be performed by it and is entitled to all benefits under, and to
the Knowledge of Parent, is not alleged to be in default in respect of any
Parent Material Contract. Each of the Parent Material Contracts is in full
force and effect, unamended, and there exists no default or event of default
or event, occurrence, condition or act, with respect to Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary or to the Knowledge of Parent with respect to the other
contracting party, which, with the giving of notice, the lapse of the time or
the happening of any other event or conditions, would become a default or
event of default under any Parent Material Contract. True, correct and
complete copies of all Parent Material Contracts have been delivered or made
available to Company.   SECTION 5.12 Litigation. There is no suit, claim,
action, proceeding or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation pending or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or materially interfere
with Parent\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein, including, without limitation, any pending or threatened class action
suit. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is subject to any
outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree which could reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or materially interfere with Parent\'s ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein.   SECTION 5.13 Environmental Matters.

aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws and all
Parent Permits required by Environmental Laws; (ii) all past noncompliance of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary with Environmental Laws or Environmental
Permits has been resolved without any pending, ongoing or future obligation,
cost or liability; and (iii) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor to
the Knowledge of Parent has any other Person released a Hazardous Material
at, or transported a Hazardous Material to or from, any real property
currently or formerly owned, leased or occupied by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, in violation of or under circumstances that could result in
liability under any Environmental Law.   SECTION 5.14 Intellectual
Property.   (a) Except as provided in Schedule 5.14(a) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Intellectual Property is: (i) owned
solely and exclusively by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary, free and clear of
any and all mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, conditional
sale agreements or encumbrances, of any kind; or (ii) rightfully used
or otherwise enjoyed by Parent or its Subsidiaries pursuant to one or
more license agreements, each of which such license agreements are, to
the Knowledge of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary, valid and
enforceable.   (b) Except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, all intellectual property registrations included in the Parent
Intellectual Property have been duly maintained, are in full force and effect
and have not been cancelled, expired (except in accordance with the terms of
any such registration) or abandoned.   (c) No action is currently pending
which asserts that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is infringing,
misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property
of any Person. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received written
notice from any Person within the past twelve (12) months asserting that
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is infringing, misappropriating, diluting or
otherwise violating any Intellectual Property of any such Person. No action
is currently pending which asserts that any Person is infringing,
misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating any Parent Intellectual
Property. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has asserted any claim of
infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation against any
Person within the past twelve (12) months. To the actual knowledge of Parent,
neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is, in any material respect,
infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating any
Intellectual Property of any Person.   (d) No action is currently pending,
or to the Knowledge of Parent threatened, which asserts a challenge to the
validity, use or enforceability of any Parent Intellectual Property.   (e)
To the Knowledge of Company, all material License Agreements to which Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound are valid and binding
obligations of Parent or Parent Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with
their terms, and there exists no event or condition which will result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute a default by Parent or Parent
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other party thereto, under
any such material License Agreement.   (f) Parent and each of the Parent
Subsidiaries takes reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of
trade secrets. To the knowledge of Parent, no trade secret of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiaries has been disclosed or authorized to be disclosed to any
Person other than pursuant to a written nondisclosure agreement that provides
commercially reasonable protections for Parent and the applicable Parent
Subsidiaries\' proprietary interests in and to such trade secrets.   (g)
Except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or as provided in
Schedule 5.14(g) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the loss or impairment of
the Parent\'s or any Parent Subsidiaries\' rights to own, use, or to bring
any action for the infringement of, any of the Parent Intellectual Property,
nor will such consummation require the consent of any Person in respect of
any Parent Intellectual Property.   (h) Except as would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, all software programs that are utilized in the
current business of Parent or a Parent Subsidiary are Year 2000
Compliant.   SECTION 5.15 Taxes.   (a) Parent and each of the Parent
Subsidiaries, and any consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group for
Tax purposes of which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is or has been a

unpaid Taxes accruing after June 30, 2000 except for Taxes incurred in
the ordinary course of business subsequent to June 30, 2000.   (b) There is
(i) no material claim for Taxes that is a lien against the property of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary or is being asserted against Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary other than liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, (ii) no audit

insured, including professional liability insurance. The policies of fire,
theft, liability, professional liability and other insurance maintained

or any Parent Subsidiary are held under valid instruments enforceable
in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable laws
of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws relating to creditors\'
rights generally and to general principles of equity (whether applied in
a proceeding in law or equity). Substantially all of Parent\'s and the
Parent Subsidiaries\' equipment in regular use has been reasonably maintained
and is in serviceable condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted.

is required to comply, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, Parent and Company shall (and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries
and Company Subsidiaries, respectively, to) (i) provide to the other (and
its officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, agents and other representatives (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES"))
access at reasonable times upon prior notice to its and its
subsidiaries\' officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities and to the books and records thereof, and (ii) furnish promptly

that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Transaction, or enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate
with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a Competing
Transaction, or agree to or endorse any Competing Transaction, or authorize
or permit any of Company\'s Representatives or Subsidiaries, or any
Representative retained by Company\'s Subsidiaries, to take any such action;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 6.05(a) shall
prohibit Company, prior to receipt of the approval by the stockholders of
Company of this Agreement and the Merger, from providing information (subject
to a customary confidentiality agreement) in connection with, and
negotiating, another unsolicited, bona fide written proposal regarding a
Competing Transaction provided that (x) the Company\'s board of directors
shall have concluded in good faith, after considering applicable Law and the
advice of independent outside counsel, that such action is necessary to
comply with the Company\'s board of directors\' fiduciary duties to the
Company\'s stockholders under applicable law, and (y) Company\'s board of
directors shall have determined in good faith that such Competing
Transaction presents a reasonable possibility of resulting in a Company
Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined). Company shall notify Parent
promptly if any proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with any Person
with respect thereto, regarding a Competing Transaction is made, such notice
to include the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry
or contact, and the terms of such Competing Transaction. Company

Transaction for or in respect of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company common stock on terms that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, taking into account
all the terms and conditions of the Competing Transaction, including any
break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation) are more favorable to all of the Company\'s stockholders than
the Merger.   (b) Parent shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall cause
its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate
or encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information),
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including,
without limitation, any proposal or offer to its stockholders) that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Transaction, or enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate
with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a Competing
Transaction, or agree to or endorse any Competing Transaction, or authorize
or permit any of Parent\'s Representatives or subsidiaries, or any
Representative retained by Parent\'s subsidiaries, to take any such action;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 6.05(b) shall
prohibit Parent, prior to receipt of the approval by the stockholders of
Parent of the issuance of Parent Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement and
the Merger, from providing information (subject to a customary
confidentiality agreement) in connection with, and negotiating, another
unsolicited, bona fide written proposal regarding a Competing Transaction
provided that (x) Parent\'s board of directors shall have concluded in good
faith, after considering applicable Law and the advice of independent outside
counsel, that such action is necessary to comply with the Company\'s
Parent\'s board of directors\' fiduciary duties to Parent\'s stockholders
under applicable law (applying principles of Delaware or Netherlands Antilles
law), and (y) Parent\'s board of directors shall have determined good faith
that such Competing Transaction presents a reasonable possibility of
resulting in a Parent Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined). Parent
shall notify Company promptly if any proposal or offer, or any inquiry or
contact with any Person with respect thereto, regarding a Competing
Transaction is made, such notice to include the identity of the Person making
such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact, and the terms of such Competing
Transaction. Parent immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to a Competing Transaction. Parent shall not release any
third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it is a party as of the date hereof. For
purposes of this Agreement, "PARENT SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any bona fide
Competing Transaction for or in respect of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Parent common stock on terms that the Board of
Directors of Parent determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with a financial advisor, taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Competing Transaction, including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) are more favorable
to all of Parent stockholders than the Merger.   SECTION 6.06 Tax-Free
Transaction; Pooling; Affiliate Letters.   (a) From and after the date of
this Agreement, each party hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify, and shall not knowingly take any actions or cause any
actions to be taken which could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
from qualifying (a) as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code or
(b) for financial accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests" in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and the accounting standards of the SEC.   (b)
Each of Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall execute and deliver to the other
a certificate, in form reasonably acceptable to Company and Parent, as the
case may be, signed by an officer of Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, setting forth factual representations and covenants that will
serve as a basis for the tax opinion required under Section 8.02(d)
hereof.   (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each person who has been identified as an "affiliate"
of it to deliver, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (if it
has not previously done so), a signed agreement to Parent in the case
of affiliates of Parent, substantially in the form attached as Annex F, and
in the case of affiliates of the Company, substantially in the form
attached as Annex G.   (d) Shares of Parent Common Stock and shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by each such "affiliate" of Parent or
Company who has not provided a signed agreement in accordance with Section
6.06(c) shall not be transferable during any period prior to and after
the Effective Time if, as a result of this transfer during any such
period, taking into account the nature, extent and timing of this transfer
and similar transfers by all other "affiliates" of Parent and the Company,
this transfer will, in the reasonable judgment of accountants of
Parent, interfere with, or prevent the Merger from being accounted for, as
a "pooling of interests" under U.S. GAAP and/or the rules and regulations
of the SEC. Neither Parent nor the Company shall register, or allow
its transfer agent to register, on its books any transfer of any shares
of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock of any affiliate of Parent

be provided in those agreements.   SECTION 6.07 Control of Operations.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Company and the
Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

obtain from Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made by Parent

and regulations of the NNM, (B) the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
any other applicable United States federal or state securities Laws, (C)
the HSR Act, if any, and (D) any other applicable Law. The parties hereto
shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of
all such filings, including by providing copies of all such documents to
the nonfiling parties and their advisors prior to filing, and none of
the parties shall file any such document if any of the other parties shall
have reasonably objected to the filing of such document. No party shall
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting
period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Merger at the
behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent and agreement of the
other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.   (b) Each of Company and Parent will give (or will cause
their respective subsidiaries to give) any notices to third Persons, and use,

accordance with past practice and U.S. GAAP (except for the absence of
footnotes) consistently applied during the periods involved (except as
otherwise disclosed in the notes thereto). Company shall provide to Parent
(x) no later than November 25, 2000, copies of its 3rd quarter financial

hereto with respect to any Parent Common Shares to be owned by such Person
upon the Effective Time, and shall contain other customary terms, provided

when such representations and warranties are  read without reference to

2000 between Sapiens International Corporation N.V., a Netherlands Antilles
corporation ("PARENT"), and the undersigned stockholders (each a

Inc., a Delaware corporation ("COMPANY"). Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the
Merger Agreement described below.   RECITALS   WHEREAS, pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of September 17,
2000 by and among Parent, Wisdom Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and Company (such
agreement as it may be amended is hereinafter referred to as the "MERGER
AGREEMENT"), Parent has agreed to acquire the outstanding securities of
Company pursuant to a merger of Merger Sub with and into Company in which
outstanding shares of capital stock of Company will be converted into shares
of common stock of Parent as set forth in the Merger Agreement (the
"TRANSACTION");   WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter into the
Merger Agreement and consummate the Transaction, Company has agreed to use
its reasonable efforts to cause certain stockholders of Company to execute
and deliver to Parent a Voting Agreement upon the terms set forth herein;
and   WHEREAS, each Stockholder is or may become the owner of shares
of capital stock of Company (the "SHARES").   NOW, THEREFORE, the parties
agree as follows:   1. Agreement to Retain Shares.   1.1. Transfer and
Encumbrance. Each Stockholder represents and warrants to Parent that (i) such
Stockholder is a record or beneficial owner of the Shares, with power to vote
the Shares or cause the Shares to be voted; (ii) the Shares set forth on the
signature page hereto constitute such Stockholder\'s entire interest in the
outstanding capital stock and voting securities of Company, other than Shares
that are held by others and are subject to similar voting agreements or
shares that are subject to employee stock options; and (iii) such
Stockholder\'s address is accurately set forth on the signature page
hereto.   1.2. New Shares. Each Stockholder agrees that any shares
of capital stock or voting securities of Company ("NEW SHARES") that
such Stockholder purchases or with respect to which Stockholder
otherwise acquires beneficial ownership after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Expiration Date (as hereinafter defined) shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they
constituted Shares. As used herein, the term "EXPIRATION DATE" shall mean the
earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof.   2. Agreement to
Vote Shares and Take Certain Other Action. Prior to the Expiration Date, at
every meeting of the stockholders of Company at which any of the following
matters is considered or voted upon, and at every adjournment or postponement
thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of the
stockholders of Company with respect to any of the following matters, each
Stockholder shall vote, or, using such Stockholder\'s best efforts, and to
the full extent legally permitted, cause the holder of record to vote the
Shares and any New Shares (except those Shares or New Shares which are not
voting securities), in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and any
proposal or action presented to a stockholders vote which would, or could
reasonably be expected to, facilitate the Merger.   Prior to the Expiration
Date, each Stockholder, as the holder of voting stock of Company, shall be
present, in person or by proxy, or, using such Stockholder\'s best efforts
and to the full extent legally permitted, attempt to cause the holder of
record to be present, in person or by proxy, at all meetings of stockholders
of Company at which any matter referred to in this Section 2 is to be voted
upon so that all Shares and New Shares are counted for the purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum at such meetings.   Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict any
Stockholder from (i) acting in his or her capacity as a director or officer
of Company, to the extent applicable, it being understood that this Agreement
shall apply to each Stockholder solely in his or her capacity as a
stockholder of Company or (ii) voting in his or her sole discretion on any
matter other than those matters referred to in the first paragraph of this
Section 2.   3. Irrevocable Proxy. Each Stockholder hereby agrees to
timely deliver to Parent a duly executed proxy in the form attached hereto
as Annex A (the "PROXY"), such Proxy to cover the issued and
outstanding Shares and all issued and outstanding New Shares in respect of
which such Stockholder is the record holder and is entitled to vote at each
meeting of the stockholders of Company (including, without limitation, each
written consent in lieu of a meeting) prior to the Expiration Date. In the
event that any Stockholder is unable to provide any such Proxy in a
timely manner, such Stockholder hereby grants Parent a power of attorney
to execute and deliver such Proxy for and on behalf of such Stockholder,
such power of attorney, which being coupled with an interest, shall survive
any death, disability, bankruptcy, or any other such impediment of
such Stockholder. Upon the execution of this Agreement by each Stockholder,
such Stockholder hereby revokes any and all prior proxies or powers of
attorney given by such Stockholder with respect to voting of the Shares on
the matters referred to in Section 2 and agrees not to grant any
subsequent proxies or powers of attorney with respect to the voting of the
Shares on the matters referred to in Section 2 until after the Expiration
Date.   4. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Stockholder.
Each Stockholder hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Parent as
follows:   (a) Such Stockholder has full power and legal capacity to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform his or her obligations
hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
such Stockholder and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
such Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder in accordance with
its terms, except as may be limited by (i) the effect of
bankruptcy, insolvency, conservatorship, arrangement, moratorium or other
laws affecting or relating to the rights of creditors generally, or (ii)
the rules governing the availability of specific performance, injunctive
relief or other equitable remedies and general principles of equity,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder does not, and
the performance of such Stockholder\'s obligations hereunder will not, result
in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others
any right to terminate, amend, accelerate or cancel any right or
obligation under, or result in the creation of any lien or encumbrance on any
Shares or New Shares pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument
or obligation to which such Stockholder is a party or by which
such Stockholder or the Shares or New Shares are or will be bound or
affected.   (b) Such Stockholder has read Section 6.05 of the Merger
Agreement and understands the Company\'s restrictions thereunder.   (c)
Such Stockholder agrees not to transfer, sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise
dispose of or encumber any of the Shares, or make any offer or agreement
relating thereto, at any time prior to the Expiration Date other than to a
transferee that agrees to be bound by the terms of this voting agreement and
the proxy attached hereto; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Nesstech LLC ("Nesstech") may distribute Shares to its members,
after providing prior notice thereof to Parent and Company, so long as such
distribution will not (i) cause any of the conditions to the consummation of
the Merger set forth in Article VIII of the Merger Agreement to not be
satisfied, as determined by Parent and Company in their reasonable
discretion, or (ii) interfere with the ability of Nesstech to have such
Shares voted as contemplated in Section 2 hereof. Each Stockholder
understands and agrees that if such Stockholder attempts to transfer, vote or
provide any other person with the authority to vote any of the Shares other
than in compliance with this Agreement, Company shall not, and each
Stockholder hereby unconditionally and irrevocably instructs Company to not,
permit any such transfer on its books and records, issue a new certificate
representing any of the Shares or record such vote unless and until such
Stockholder shall have complied with the terms of this Agreement.   (d)
Such Stockholder waives, as of the Effective Time, any claims it may have in
its capacity as a stockholder and has no knowledge of any pending or
threatened claims against the Company by any other security holder of the
Company.   (e) Such Stockholder will take all actions to terminate, as of
the Effective Time, all agreements contemplated by Section 8.3(d) of the
Merger Agreement to be terminated as of the Effective Time.   5. Additional
Documents. Each Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees to execute and
deliver any additional documents necessary or desirable, in the reasonable
opinion of Parent, to carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement.  
6. Consent and Waiver. Each Stockholder hereby gives any consents or waivers
that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Transaction under
the terms of any agreement to which such Stockholder is a party or pursuant
to any rights such Stockholder may have provided, however, that such
Stockholder shall not be required by this Section 6 to give any consent or
waiver in his capacity as a director or officer of Company.   7.
Termination. This Agreement and the Proxy delivered in connection herewith
and all obligations of each Stockholder hereunder and thereunder, shall
terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the Expiration
Date.   8. Miscellaneous.   8.1. Severability. If any term, provision,
covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, then the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired
or invalidated.   8.2. Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement and
all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
but, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties
hereto may be assigned by either of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other. This Agreement is intended to bind each Stockholder
solely as a securityholder of Company only with respect to the specific
matters set forth herein.   8.3. Amendment and Modification. This Agreement
may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except by the execution
and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties hereto.   8.4.
Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto acknowledge that
Parent will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy
at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of each
Stockholder set forth herein. Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to
any other remedies that may be available to Parent upon any such violation,
Parent shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements by
specific performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to
Parent at law or in equity and each Stockholder hereby waives any and all
defenses which could exist in its favor in connection with such enforcement
and waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in
connection with such enforcement.   8.5. Notices. All notices, requests,
demands or other communications that are required or may be given pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been duly given (a) when delivered, if delivered by hand, (b) one business
day after transmitted, if transmitted by a nationally recognized overnight

and Reorganization dated as of September 17, 2000 by and among Parent,
Wisdom Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and Company (such agreement as it may be amended

to acquire the outstanding securities of Company pursuant to a merger
of Merger Sub with and into Company in which outstanding shares of
capital stock of Company will be converted into shares of common stock of
Parent as set forth in the Merger Agreement (the "TRANSACTION");   WHEREAS,
in order to induce Company to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate
the Transaction, Parent has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause
certain stockholders of Parent to execute and deliver to Company a Voting
Agreement upon the terms set forth herein; and   WHEREAS, each Stockholder
is or may become the owner of shares of capital stock of Parent (the
"SHARES").   NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:   1. Agreement
to Retain Shares.   1.1. Transfer and Encumbrance. Each Stockholder
represents and warrants to Company that (i) such Stockholder is a record or
beneficial owner of the Shares with power to vote the Shares or cause the
Shares to be voted; (ii) the Shares set forth on the signature page hereto
constitute such Stockholder\'s entire interest in the outstanding capital
stock and voting securities of Parent other than Shares that are held by
others and are subject to similar voting agreements or shares that are
subject to employee stock options; and (iii) such Stockholder\'s address is
accurately set forth on the signature page hereto.   1.2. New Shares. Each
Stockholder agrees that any shares of capital stock or voting securities of
Parent ("NEW SHARES") that such Stockholder purchases or with respect to
which Stockholder otherwise acquires beneficial ownership after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Date (as hereinafter defined)
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same
extent as if they constituted Shares. As used herein, the term "EXPIRATION
DATE" shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii)
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof.  
2. Agreement to Vote Shares and Take Certain Other Action. Prior to the

of the following matters is considered or voted upon, and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by
written consent of the stockholders of Parent with respect to any of
the following matters, each Stockholder shall vote, or, using
such Stockholder\'s best efforts, and to the full extent legally permitted,
cause the holder of record to vote the Shares and any New Shares (except
those Shares or New Shares which are not voting securities), in favor of
adoption of the Articles Amendment, the Share Issuance and the Domestication
of Parent and any proposal or action presented to a stockholder vote
which would, or could reasonably be expected to, facilitate the Merger.  
Prior to the Expiration Date, each Stockholder, as the holder of voting stock
of Parent, shall be present, in person or by proxy, or, using such
Stockholder\'s best efforts and to the full extent legally permitted, attempt
to cause the holder of record to be present, in person or by proxy, at all
meetings of stockholders of Parent at which any matter referred to in this
Section 2 is to be voted upon so that all Shares and New Shares are counted
for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at
such meetings.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit or restrict any Stockholder from (i) acting in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of Parent, to the extent applicable, it
being understood that this Agreement shall apply to each Stockholder solely
in his or her capacity as a stockholder of Parent or (ii) voting in his or
her sole discretion on any matter other than those matters referred to in
the first paragraph of this Section 2.   3. Irrevocable Proxy. Each
Stockholder hereby agrees to timely deliver to Company a duly executed proxy
in the form attached hereto as Annex A (the "PROXY"), such Proxy to cover the
issued and outstanding Shares and all issued and outstanding New Shares in
respect of which such Stockholder is the record holder and is entitled to
vote at each meeting of the stockholders of Parent (including, without
limitation, each written consent in lieu of a meeting) prior to the
Expiration Date. In the event that any Stockholder is unable to provide any
such Proxy in a timely manner, such Stockholder hereby grants Company a power
of attorney to execute and deliver such Proxy for and on behalf of such
Stockholder, such power of attorney, which being coupled with an interest,
shall survive any death, disability, bankruptcy, or any other such impediment
of such Stockholder. Upon the execution of this Agreement by each
Stockholder, such Stockholder hereby revokes any and all prior proxies or
powers of attorney given by such Stockholder with respect to voting of the
Shares on the matters referred to in Section 2 and agrees not to grant any
subsequent proxies or powers of attorney with respect to the voting of the
Shares on the matters referred to in Section 2 until after the Expiration
Date.   4. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Stockholder.

follows:   (a) Such Stockholder has full power and legal capacity to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform his or her obligations
hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
such Stockholder and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
such Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder in accordance with
its terms, except as may be limited by (i) the effect of
bankruptcy, insolvency, conservatorship, arrangement, moratorium or other
laws affecting or relating to the rights of creditors generally, or (ii)
the rules governing the availability of specific performance, injunctive
relief or other equitable remedies and general principles of equity,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder does not, and
the performance of such Stockholder\'s obligations hereunder will not, result
in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others
any right to terminate, amend, accelerate or cancel any right or
obligation under, or result in the creation of any lien or encumbrance on any
Shares or New Shares pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument
or obligation to which such Stockholder is a party or by which
such Stockholder or the Shares or New Shares are or will be bound or
affected.   (b) Each Stockholder has read Section 6.05 of the Merger
Agreement and understands the Parent\'s restrictions thereunder.   (c) Each
Stockholder agrees not to transfer, sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise
dispose of or encumber any of the Shares, or make any offer or agreement
relating thereto, at any time prior to the Expiration Date other than to a
transferee that agrees to be bound by the terms of this voting agreement and
the proxy attached hereto. Each Stockholder understands and agrees that if
such Stockholder attempts to transfer, vote or provide any other person with
the authority to vote any of the Shares other than in compliance with this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and each Stockholder hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably instructs Parent to not, permit any such transfer on its books
and records, issue a new certificate representing any of the Shares or record
such vote unless and until such Stockholder shall have complied with the
terms of this Agreement.   5. Additional Documents. Each Stockholder hereby
covenants and agrees to execute and deliver any additional documents
necessary or desirable, in the reasonable opinion of Company, to carry out
the purpose and intent of this Agreement.   6. Consent and Waiver. Each
Stockholder hereby gives any consents or waivers that are reasonably required
for the consummation of the Transaction under the terms of any agreement to
which such Stockholder is a party or pursuant to any rights such Stockholder
may have provided, however, that such Stockholder shall not be required by
this Section 6 to give any consent or waiver in his capacity as a director or
officer of Parent.   7. Termination. This Agreement and the Proxy delivered
in connection herewith and all obligations of each Stockholder hereunder
and thereunder, shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as
of the Expiration Date.   8. Miscellaneous.   8.1. Severability. If any
term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, then the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.   8.2. Binding Effect and Assignment.
This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, but, except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the
parties hereto may be assigned by either of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other. This Agreement is intended to bind each
Stockholder solely as a securityholder of Parent only with respect to the

hereto.   8.4. Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties

Company upon any such violation, Company shall have the right to enforce

by any other means available to Company at law or in equity and

its favor in connection with such enforcement and waives any requirement
for the security or posting of any bond in connection with such
enforcement.   8.5. Notices. All notices, requests, demands or
other communications that are required or may be given pursuant to the terms

BY-LAWS   OF   SAPIENS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION N.V.   (hereinafter
called the "Corporation")     ARTICLE I   OFFICES   Section 1.
Registered Office. The registered office of the Corporation shall be in the
City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware.   Section 2.
Other Offices. The Corporation may also have offices at such other places,
both within and without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may
from time to time determine.   ARTICLE II   MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS  
Section 1. Place of Meetings. Meetings of the stockholders for the election
of directors or for any other purpose shall be held at such time and place,
either within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be designated from
time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the
meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.   Section 2. Annual
Meetings. The annual meetings of stockholders shall be held on such date and
at such time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting, at which meetings the
stockholders shall elect directors, and transact such other business as may
properly be brought before the meeting. Written notice of the annual meeting
stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each
stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten nor more than
sixty days before the date of the meeting.   Section 3. Special Meetings.
Unless otherwise prescribed by law or by the certificate of incorporation of
the Corporation, as amended and restated from time to time (the "Certificate
of Incorporation"), special meetings of stockholders, for any purpose or
purposes, may be called by either (i) the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
(ii) the Co-Chairman or (iii) the Board of Directors in accordance with the
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation in effect as of the date
hereof. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed
meeting. At a special meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall
be conducted as shall be specified in the notice of meeting (or any
supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors.
Written notice of a special meeting stating the place, date and hour of the
meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called shall be
given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the
meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.   Section 4.
Quorum. Except as otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of
Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the capital stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the
transaction of business. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by
the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. If, however, such
quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the
stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to
time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum
shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum
shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might
have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date
is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall
be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than
ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting.   Section 5.
Proxies. Any stockholder entitled to vote may do so in person or by his or
her proxy appointed by an instrument in writing or by electronic proxy
subscribed by such stockholder or by his or her attorney thereunto
authorized, delivered to the Secretary of the meeting; provided, however,
that no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date,
unless said proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner
in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him
or her as proxy, either of the following shall constitute a valid means by
which a stockholder may grant such authority:   (i) A stockholder may
execute a writing authorizing another  person or persons to act for him or
her as proxy. Execution may be  accomplished by the stockholder or his or her
authorized officer,  director, employee or agent signing such writing or
causing his or her  signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable
means,  including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.   (ii) A
stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act  for him or her as
proxy by transmitting or authorizing the  transmission of a telegram or other
means of electronic transmission  to the person who will be the holder of the
proxy or to a proxy  solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or
like agent  duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy
to  receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram or other 
means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted  with
information from which it can be determined that the telegram or  other
electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.  Any copy,
facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or
transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a
stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or
transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used; provided that such copy,
facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.   Section 6.
Voting. At all meetings of the stockholders at which a quorum is present,
except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these By-Laws, any question brought before any meeting of stockholders shall
be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total
number of votes cast on such question. The Board of Directors, in its
discretion, or the officer of the Corporation presiding at a meeting of
stockholders, in his or her discretion, may require that any votes cast at
such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.   Section 7. List of
Stockholders Entitled to Vote. The officer of the Corporation who has charge
of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten
days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,
during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to
the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be
held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not
so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall
also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder of the
Corporation who is present.   Section 8. Stock Ledger. The stock ledger of
the Corporation shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders
entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list required by Section 9 of this
Article II or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy
at any meeting of stockholders.   Section 9. Record Date. In order that the
Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or adjournment thereof, shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten
days before the date of such meeting; and (2) in the case of any other
action, shall not be more than sixty days prior to such other action. If no
record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held; and (2) the record date for
determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors
may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.   Section 10.
Inspectors of Election. In advance of any meeting of stockholders, the Board
by resolution or the Chairman or President shall appoint one or more
inspectors of election to act at the meeting and make a written report
thereof. One or more other persons may be designated as alternate inspectors
to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is
present, ready and willing to act at a meeting of stockholders, the Chairman
of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.
Unless otherwise required by law, inspectors may be officers, employees or
agents of the Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge
of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the
duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his
or her ability. The inspector shall have the duties prescribed by law and
shall take charge of the polls and, when the vote is completed, shall make a
certificate of the result of the vote taken and of such other facts as may be
required by law.   ARTICLE III   DIRECTORS   Section 1. Number and
Election of Directors. The directors shall be elected by a plurality (or for
so long as the Corporation is also incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands Antilles, a majority) of the votes cast, in person or by proxy,
by the shareholders entitled to vote. The number of persons constituting the
whole Board of Directors shall not be less than three (3) nor more than
twenty-four (24), as fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors (or
for so long as the Corporation is also incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands Antilles, by the Shareholders). Any vacancies may be filled by
the Board of Directors (or for so long as the Corporation is also
incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands Antilles, by the
Shareholders).   Section 2. Vacancies. The filling of any vacancy on the
Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors
shall be governed by these By-Laws. Whenever the holders of any one or more
class or classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation shall have
the right, voting separately as a class, to elect directors at an annual
or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling
of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall also be
governed by the Certificate of Incorporation.   Section 3. Duties and
Powers. The business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors which may exercise all such powers of the
Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or
by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws required to be

meeting of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
or, in his or her absence, a director chosen by a majority of the directors
present, shall act as Chairman. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as
Secretary at each meeting of the Board of Directors. In case the Secretary
shall be absent from any meeting of the Board of Directors, an Assistant
Secretary shall perform the duties of Secretary at such meeting; and in the
absence from any such meeting of the Secretary and all the Assistant
Secretaries, the Chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as
Secretary of the meeting.   Section 5. Resignations and Removals of
Directors. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time, by giving
written notice to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or
the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the
time therein specified or, if no time is specified, immediately; and, unless
otherwise specified in such notice, the acceptance of such resignation shall
not be necessary to make it effective. Except as otherwise required by law
and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of preferred
stock then outstanding, any director or the entire Board of Directors may
be removed from office at any time, but only for cause, and only by
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote in the election of directors.   Section 6. Meetings. The Board of
Directors of the Corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special,

time be determined by the Board of Directors and, unless required by
resolution of the Board of Directors, without notice. Special meetings of the
Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman or Co-Chairman of the Board
of Directors. Notice thereof stating the place, date and hour of the meeting
shall be given to each director either by mail not less than ninety-six (96)

director, or not later than the calendar day immediately preceding the date
of such meeting, by personal delivery, or by telephone call or by sending a
telegram, cable or telefax to each director.   Section 7. Quorum. Except as
may be otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
By-Laws, at all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the entire
Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business
and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which
there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors. If a quorum
shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors
present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice
other than announcement at the meeting of the time and place of the adjourned
meeting, until a quorum shall be present.   Section 8. Actions of Board.
Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-
Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the
Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a
meeting, if all the members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the
case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or
committee.   Section 9. Meetings by Means of Conference Telephone.
Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-
Laws, members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or any
committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting
of the Board of Directors or such committee by means of a conference
telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation
in a meeting pursuant to this Section 9 shall constitute presence in person
at such meeting.   Section 10. Committees. The Board of Directors may, by
resolution passed by a majority of the entire Board of Directors, designate
one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the
directors of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or
more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any
absent or disqualified member at any meeting of any such committee. In the
absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, and in the absence of
a designation by the Board of Directors of an alternate member to replace
the absent or disqualified member, the member or members thereof present at
any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or
they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board
of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any absent or
disqualified member. Any committee, to the extent permitted by law and
provided in the resolution establishing such committee, shall have and may
exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the Corporation. Each committee
shall keep regular minutes and report to the Board of Directors when
required.   Section 11. Executive Committee. The Board of Directors
by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board of Directors
may appoint an Executive Committee (and may discontinue the same at any
time) to consist of one or more directors of the Corporation to hold office
at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The Executive Committee
shall, subject to the provisions laid down in these By-Laws, have may execute
all powers and authority delegated to it by the Board of Directors
regarding the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation.  The Executive Committee shall not have the power or authority

substantially all of the Corporation\'s property and assets;   (c) recommend
to the shareholders the dissolution and liquidation of the  Corporation;  
(d) amend the Bylaws;   (e) declare interim dividends; or   (f) authorize
the issuance of shares;  for as much as such powers are within the authority
of the entire Board of Directors or the General Meeting of Shareholders.  
Section 12. Compensation. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any,
of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a
fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a
stated salary, or such other emoluments as the Board of Directors shall from
time to time determine. No such payment shall preclude any director from
serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation
therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like
compensation for attending committee meetings.   Section 13. Interested
Directors. No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more
of its directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other
corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which one or
more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a
financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or
solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the
meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the
contract or transaction, or solely because such person\'s or their votes are
counted for such purpose if (i) the material facts as to such person\'s or
their relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction
are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and
the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract
or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the
disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than
a quorum; or (ii) the material facts as to such person\'s or their
relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed
or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract
or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of
the stockholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to
the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by
the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders. Common
or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a
quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee which
authorizes the contract or transaction.   ARTICLE IV   OFFICERS

by the President or any Vice President and any such officer may, in the name
of and on behalf of the Corporation, take all such action as any such officer
may deem advisable to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of security
holders of any corporation in which the Corporation may own securities and at
any such meeting shall possess and may exercise any and all rights and
power incident to the ownership of such securities and which, as the
owner thereof, the Corporation might have exercised and possessed if present.
The Board of Directors may, by resolution, from time to time confer like

of the Board of Directors and, if there be one, the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, have general supervision of the business of the Corporation and

carried into effect. In the event no President is appointed, the Chief
Executive Officer shall act as the President, possess the same power as the

by the Board of Directors.   Section 6. President. The President, if there
be one, shall, subject to the control of the Board of Directors, the Chief
Executive Officer and, if there be one, the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the business of
the Corporation. The President shall execute all bonds, mortgages,
contracts and other instruments of the Corporation requiring a seal, under
the seal of the Corporation, except where required or permitted by law to

the Corporation may sign and execute documents when so authorized by
these By-Laws, the Board of Directors or the President. The President shall
also perform such other duties and may exercise such other powers as from
time to time may be assigned to him or her by these By-Laws or by the Board
of Directors.   Section 7. Vice Presidents. At the request of the President
or in his or her absence or in the event of his or her inability or refusal

notice of all meetings of the stockholders and special meetings of the Board
of Directors, and shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by
the Board of Directors or President, under whose supervision the
Secretary shall be. If the Secretary shall be unable or shall refuse to cause
to be given notice of all meetings of the stockholders and special meetings
of the Board of Directors, and if there be no Assistant Secretary, then
either the Board of Directors or the President may choose another officer to
cause such notice to be given. The Secretary shall have custody of the seal
of the Corporation and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, if there
be one, shall have authority to affix the same to any instrument requiring
it and when so affixed, it may be attested by the signature of the
Secretary or by the signature of any such Assistant Secretary. The Board of
Directors may give general authority to any other officer to affix the seal

shall perform such duties and have such powers as from time to time may
be assigned to them by the Board of Directors, the President, any
Vice President, if there be one, or the Secretary, and in the absence of

act, shall perform the duties of the Treasurer, and when so acting, shall
have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon
the Treasurer. If required by the Board of Directors, an Assistant

or sureties as shall be satisfactory to the Board of Directors for
the faithful performance of the duties of the office of Assistant Treasurer
and for the restoration to the Corporation, in case of the

Signatures. Any or all of the signatures on a certificate may be a facsimile.
In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to

issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such
person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of
issue.   Section 3. Lost, Destroyed, Stolen or Mutilated Certificates.
The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate to be issued in place
of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact

or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate, the Board
of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, or such person\'s legal representative, to advertise
the same in such manner as the Board of Directors shall require and/or to
give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to
the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   Section
4. Transfers. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in the manner

payment of all necessary transfer taxes; provided, however, that such
surrender and endorsement or payment of taxes shall not be required in any
case in which the officers of the Corporation shall determine to waive such
requirement. Every certificate exchanged, returned or surrendered to the
Corporation shall be marked "Cancelled," with the date of cancellation, by
the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or the transfer agent
thereof. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for
any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the
Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.   Section 5.

one or more transfer offices or agencies and registry offices or agencies at
such place or places as may be determined from time to time by the Board of
Directors.   Section 6. Beneficial Owners. The Corporation shall be entitled
to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as
the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and
to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books
as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable
or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any
other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
thereof, except as otherwise provided by law.   ARTICLE VI   NOTICES  
Section 1. Notices. Whenever written notice is required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to be given to any director,
member of a committee or stockholder, such notice may be given by mail,
addressed to such director, member of a committee or stockholder, at such
person\'s address as it appears on the records of the Corporation,
with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at
the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail.
Written notice may also be given personally or by telegram, facsimile, telex
or cable.   Section 2. Waivers of Notice.   (a) Whenever any notice is
required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to be
given to any director, member of a committee or stockholder, a waiver thereof
in writing, signed, by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether
before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to
notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting, present by person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where
the person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.   (b) Neither the business to
be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.   ARTICLE VII   GENERAL
PROVISIONS   Section 1. Dividends. Subject to the requirements of the GCL
and the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, dividends upon

stock.   Section 2. Disbursements. All checks or demands for money
and notes of the Corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers

to time designate.   Section 3. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the
Corporation shall be the calendar year.   Section 4. Corporate Seal. The
corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation, the
year of its organization and the words "Corporate Seal, Delaware". The seal

or reproduced or otherwise.   ARTICLE VIII   INDEMNIFICATION   Section
1. Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings Other than Those by or
in the Right of the Corporation. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII,
the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the
fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or
is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director or officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person
acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, such person had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit
or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption
that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such
person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.  
Section 2. Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the
Right of the Corporation. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the
Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by
or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that
the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability
but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of
Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.   Section 3. Authorization
of Indemnification. Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in
the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director
or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this
Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by a
majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or
proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) if there are no such
directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that
a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits
or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above,
or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall
be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without
the necessity of authorization in the specific case.   Section 4. Good
Faith Defined. For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this
Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful, if such person\'s action is based on the records or books of
account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied
to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in
the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the
Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or
reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent
certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with
reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another
enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall
not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in
which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.  
Section 5. Indemnification by a Court. Notwithstanding any contrary
determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and
notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or
officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any
other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for
indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of
this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a
determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer
is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable
standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the
case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under
Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination
thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption
that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any
applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification
pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon
the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the
director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid
the expense of prosecuting such application.   Section 6. Expenses Payable
in Advance. Expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending or
investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be
paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as
authorized in this Article VIII.   Section 7. Non-exclusivity of
Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the
Certificate of Incorporation or any By-Law, agreement, contract, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction
(howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise,
both as to action in such person\'s official capacity and as to action in
another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the
Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2
of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law.
The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the
indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this
Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to
indemnify under the provisions of the GCL, or otherwise.   Section 8.
Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or
was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such
person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person\'s status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to
indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
Article VIII.   Section 9. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Article
VIII, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the
resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent
of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its
separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a
director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director
or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions
of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation
as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if
its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article
VIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving
at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties
on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in
the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit
plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VIII.  
Section 10. Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such a person.   Section 11. Limitation on Indemnification.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary,
except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be
governed by Section 5 hereof), the Corporation shall not be obligated to
indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal
or legal representatives) or advance expenses in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation.   Section 12. Indemnification of Employees and Agents.
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement
of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to
those conferred in this Article VIII to directors and officers of
the Corporation.   ARTICLE IX   AMENDMENTS   Section 1. Amendments.
These By-Laws may be altered, amended or repealed, in whole or in part, or
new By-Laws may be adopted by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders
as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.   Section 2. Entire Board
of Directors. As used in this Article IX and in these By-Laws generally, the
term "entire Board of Directors" means the total number of directors which
the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies.     ANNEX F
