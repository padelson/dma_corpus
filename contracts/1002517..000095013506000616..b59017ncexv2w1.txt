Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Buyer
Subsidiary shall merge with and into the Company. At the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of the Buyer Subsidiary shall cease and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation of the Merger (as such, the

2.6(f) and Article 7, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take

conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by such date, on the third
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the
obligations of the Parties set forth in Article 7 (other than conditions with
respect to actions contemplated to be taken at the Closing itself)) or at
such other place or on such other date as the Company and the Buyer may
mutually agree. The date applicable under this Section 2.2 is called the
"Closing Date."   SECTION 2.3. ACTIONS AT THE CLOSING. At the Closing, (a)
the Company will deliver to the Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiary the
documents described in Sections 2.9(a) and 7.1(k), (b) the Buyer and the

cause to be delivered to the Exchange Agent for deposit pursuant to the  
21    Exchange Agency Agreement an aggregate amount equal to the sum of
the Buyer Payment and the Additional Closing Payment.   SECTION 2.4. EFFECT
OF THE MERGER.   (a) The Merger shall become effective at the time at which
the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later time as the Company and the Buyer may mutually
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). After
the Effective Time, (i) the Company, as the Surviving Corporation, shall
continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and (ii) the
separate corporate existence of the Company, as the Surviving Corporation,
with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall
continue unaffected by the Merger. In addition, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the DGCL, Sections 2.4(b), 2.4(c), 2.4(d) and 2.5 and
Article 3. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective
Time, all of the properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of the Company and the Buyer Subsidiary shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation and all of the debts, liabilities, obligations and
duties of the Company and the Buyer Subsidiary shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation. The
Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the Effective Time, take any
action (including executing, delivering, acknowledging, publishing and filing
any Contract, Consent, Tax Return, Permit or other document) in the name and
on behalf of either the Company or the Buyer Subsidiary that is or may be
necessary, appropriate or expedient in order to carry out and effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) At the Effective Time,
the restated certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in
its entirety so that it reads as set forth in Exhibit B. After the Effective
Time, such restated certificate of incorporation, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the DGCL, such restated certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation as then in
effect.   (c) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall
be amended in their entirety so that they read as set forth in Exhibit C.
After the Effective Time, such bylaws, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation as then
in effect and such bylaws.   (d) At the Effective Time, the officers and
directors, respectively, of the Buyer Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers and directors, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time. Such officers
shall initially hold the same offices of the Surviving Corporation as they
hold of the Buyer Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
such officers and directors shall hold office in accordance with the DGCL and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation as
then in effect.   SECTION 2.5. PURCHASE PRICE; MERGER CONSIDERATION;
CONVERSION OF SHARES.   22     (a) The purchase price for 100% of the
equity of the Company on a debt-free and cash-free basis is $357,000,000 (the
"Buyer Payment").   (b) At and as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the stockholders of the Company,
each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than a Dissenting Share) shall be converted into the
right to receive, without interest, the sum of (i) the Per Share Buyer
Payment, and (ii) the Per Share Additional Closing Payment (together with the
Per Share Buyer Payment, the "Per Share Merger Consideration"), all such
shares shall be canceled and cease to exist and each holder of a certificate
representing any of such shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares, except the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration for such shares. After the Effective Time, no share of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed to be issued or outstanding or to have any rights other than as set
forth in this Article 2 or Article 3.   (c) At and as of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, all shares of Common Stock, if any, that are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time as treasury
stock shall be canceled without any consideration therefor or conversion
thereof and shall cease to exist and, after the Effective Time, no such
shares shall be deemed to be issued or outstanding. At and as of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the stockholders of the Buyer Subsidiary, each share of capital stock of the
Buyer Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding and shall thereafter represent one
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (d) At or
before the Effective Time, the Buyer will deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent pursuant to the Exchange Agency Agreement, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an aggregate amount equal to the sum
of (i) the Buyer Payment, and (ii) the Additional Closing Payment. The
aggregate amount so required to be deposited is called the "Exchange
Fund."   (e) At or before the Effective Time, to the extent that Letters of
Transmittal (and certificates representing the shares of Common Stock covered
thereby or affidavits satisfying the requirements of Section 2.5(f) as to
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates representing the shares of
Common Stock covered thereby) have previously been delivered to the Company
pursuant to Section 6.4, the Company will deliver such Letters of Transmittal
(and corresponding certificates or affidavits) to the Exchange Agent.
Immediately after the Effective Time, the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail a Letter of Transmittal to each holder
of record of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time who has not previously submitted a Letter of
Transmittal (and corresponding certificates or affidavits) that has been
delivered to the Exchange Agent. The Surviving Corporation shall promptly
deliver to the Exchange Agent all Letters of Transmittal (and corresponding
certificates or affidavits) received by it after the Effective Time.   (f)
At and after the Effective Time, the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation will
cause the Exchange Agent, upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of each such
Letter of   23    Transmittal (and corresponding certificates or
affidavits), duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, to pay, by check or, to the extent permitted under the Exchange
Agency Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in
accordance with the instructions in such Letter of Transmittal, the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock covered by such Letter of Transmittal
(after giving effect to any required withholding of Taxes) to the Person to
whom payment thereof is directed in such Letter of Transmittal; provided,
that no such payment shall be made in respect of Dissenting Shares except as
provided in Article 3. To the extent that any Taxes are so withheld, the
amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered
holder under the certificate surrendered or affidavit delivered therewith, it
shall be a condition precedent to such payment that the certificate so
surrendered shall be, or be accompanied by a stock transfer power, properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form to effect such transfer and that the
Person directing such payment shall (i) pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of payment to a Person other than the registered holder
under the certificate surrendered or affidavit delivered therewith or (ii)
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation (which
satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld) that such Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. If any certificate representing issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
it shall be a condition precedent to such payment that the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed shall have delivered to the
Surviving Corporation a duly executed and completed affidavit, in such form
as shall have been reasonably prescribed by the Company, as to that fact and
a bond in such sum (or an agreement or other arrangement to indemnify the
Surviving Corporation in such a manner) as it may reasonably prescribe
to protect it against any Claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.   (g) The Company will cause its transfer agent to
furnish promptly to the Buyer Subsidiary a list, as of a recent date, of the
record holders of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and their
addresses and lists, as of a recent date, of security positions with respect
to issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock held in securities
depositories. The Company will furnish to the Buyer Subsidiary such
additional information (including a list of those stockholders who have
previously submitted Letters of Transmittal (and corresponding certificates
or affidavits) to the Company pursuant to Section 6.4), will cause its
transfer agent to furnish such additional information (including updated
lists of security positions) and provide such other assistance as the Buyer,
the Buyer Subsidiary or their agents may reasonably request in order to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Article 2.   (h) The Buyer
(or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) may cause the
Exchange Agent to invest the cash held in the Exchange Fund in one or more
investments selected by the Buyer (or, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) as provided in the Exchange Agency Agreement;
provided, however, that the terms and conditions of the investments shall be
such as to permit the Exchange Agent to make prompt payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration when due. The Buyer will replace promptly any portion of
the Exchange Fund which is lost by reason of such investments.   24    
(i) At any time beginning 180 days after the Effective Time, the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation may cause the Exchange Agent to pay over to the
Surviving Corporation any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any earnings thereon) then remaining. After such payment, holders of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be entitled to look to (but solely to) the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws), as (but
solely as) general creditors thereof, for payment, without interest, of the
Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of their shares. No Party shall
have, and the Exchange Agent shall not have, any Liability to any Person
arising out of payment to any Governmental Authority of any amount otherwise
payable hereunder to such Person pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.   (j) The Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid (or,
after the Effective Time, shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay) all
fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent. Such fees and expenses shall not be
included in the Company Transaction Expenses deducted in calculating the
Closing Adjustment.   SECTION 2.6. WORKING CAPITAL; NET AVAILABLE CASH;
CLOSING ADJUSTMENT.   (a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare and deliver to the Buyer, promptly (and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, within 30 days) after the end of each calendar month
prior to the Closing, a consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of such
month-end and a consolidated statement of results of operations of the
Company for the year-to-date through such month-end (the "Monthly Financial
Statements"), in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for the
absence of footnotes and normal year-end adjustments and as set forth on
Schedule 2.6), accompanied by a written statement signed by the chief
financial officer of the Company confirming that such balance sheet and
statement of results of operations were so prepared and that, to the
Knowledge of the Company, the Company has performed and complied in all
material respects with the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 6.2
to be performed and complied with by the Company prior to the date of such
delivery.   (b) In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraph
(a) above, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer:   (i) no later than
March 10, 2006, a written statement signed by the chief financial officer of
the Company setting forth a statement of (i) the February 28 Working Capital
and (ii) the February 28 Net Available Cash and confirming that, to the
Knowledge of the Company, the Company has performed and complied in all
material respects with the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 6.2
to be performed and complied with by the Company prior to the date of such
delivery, together with reasonably detailed supporting documents, information
and calculations (the "Pre-Closing Working Capital and Net Available Cash
Estimate"); and   (ii) no later than 5 Business Days prior to the Closing
Date then anticipated in good faith by the Company, a written
statement signed by the chief financial officer of the Company setting forth
a statement of the estimate of each component of the Closing Adjustment and
confirming that, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has  
25    performed and complied in all material respects with the covenants
and agreements set forth in Section 6.2 to be performed and complied with by
the Company prior to the date of such delivery, together with reasonably
detailed supporting documents, information and calculations for each
component of the Closing Adjustment (the "Closing Adjustment Estimate" and,
together with the Pre-Closing Working Capital and Net Available Cash
Estimate, the "Estimates" and, each, an "Estimate"). In connection with
preparing the Closing Adjustment Estimate, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from counsel and advisers to and accountants for
the Company and the Subsidiaries who provide services in connection with the
negotiation, execution, delivery and performance by the Company and the
Subsidiaries of this Agreement and the Related Agreements and the process
leading up thereto binding estimates of their unbilled fees and expenses
through consummation of the Closing. Such estimates, together with the then
billed and unpaid fees and expenses of such counsel, advisers and accountants
in connection with such services, shall be included in the Company
Transaction Expenses deducted in connection with calculating the Closing
Adjustment.   (c) Promptly after the Monthly Financial Statements and
the Estimates shall have been delivered to the Buyer, the Buyer shall review
them. The Buyer shall have the right to engage, at its expense,
independent accountants to assist it in connection with such review. Promptly
upon reasonable request by the Buyer or such accountants, the Company shall
deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to the Buyer and such accountants
such copies of Company Business Records and access to Employees as reasonably
necessary or appropriate in connection with such review. Without limiting the
rights or obligations of the Parties under the preceding sentences of this
Section 2.6(c) or under Sections 2.6(d), 2.6(e) and 2.6(f), if the Buyer has
any concerns regarding the Monthly Financial Statements or the Estimates, the
Buyer shall promptly notify the Company thereof and the Company and the Buyer
shall promptly thereafter discuss such concerns.   (d) Subject to the next
sentence, the Buyer may object to any amount or calculation set forth in the
Estimates by giving written notice to that effect to the Company within the
later of March 15, 2006 and 3 Business Days after the delivery of the
respective Estimate to the Buyer (an "Objection Notice"); provided, however,
that no such notice shall constitute an Objection Notice unless it describes
in reasonable detail the objection and the basis therefor and is accompanied
by reasonably detailed supporting documents, information and calculations.
The Buyer may object to any amount or calculation set forth in the Estimates
only:   (i) on the basis that the respective Estimate was not prepared in
accordance with this Agreement, that relevant assets, liabilities, expenses
or other line items were misstated, incorrectly included or
incorrectly omitted, or that a mathematical error was made;   (ii) with
respect to the Pre-Closing Working Capital and Net Available Cash Estimate
only, if the aggregate amount by which the estimate of the February 28 Net
Available Cash and February 28 Working Capital reflected on the Pre-Closing
Working Capital and Net Available Cash Estimate would change if the
objections described in the Objection Notice were given effect, would exceed
$400,000; and   26     (iii) with respect to the Closing Adjustment
Estimate only, if the aggregate amount by which the estimate of the Closing
Adjustment reflected on the Closing Adjustment Estimate would change if the
objections described in the Objection Notice were given effect, would exceed
$100,000.   (e) If the Buyer agrees with the amounts and calculations
set forth in the respective Estimate and gives written notice to that effect
to the Company (which the Buyer shall have the right to do at any time), or
fails to duly give an Objection Notice to the Company within the later of
March 15, 2006 and 3 Business Days after delivery of the respective Estimate,
the amounts and calculations set forth in the respective Estimate shall be
final and binding. If the Buyer duly gives an Objection Notice, any amounts
and calculations not specifically objected to therein in accordance with this
Section 2.6(e) shall be final and binding.   (f) If the Buyer duly gives an
Objection Notice with respect to an Estimate, the Buyer and the Company shall
promptly negotiate in good faith to agree on revised amounts and calculations
covered by such Objection Notice. If the Buyer and the Company so agree
(which they shall have the right to do at any time), the revised amounts and
calculations shall be set forth in a written document signed by both of them,
which shall be final and binding. If the Buyer and the Company fail to so
agree within 2 Business Days after receipt of such Objection Notice (or such
later date as may be mutually agreed by the Buyer and the Company), then the
Buyer and the Company shall promptly engage the Selected Accountants to
resolve such objections as promptly as possible (and, in any event, with a
view toward resolving such objections within 5 Business Days after becoming
so engaged). The fees and expenses of the Selected Accountants in connection
with such determination shall be borne by the Party whose claims differ to a
greater extent from the determination of the Selected Accountants (and any
such fees and expenses to be borne by the Company shall be included in the
Company Transaction Expenses deducted in calculating the Closing Adjustment),
and the engagement of the Selected Accountants shall be subject to such terms
and conditions as the Selected Accountants shall reasonably request. Promptly
upon reasonable request by the Selected Accountants, the Company
shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to the Selected Accountants
such copies of Company Business Records and access to Employees as the
Selected Accountants may determine to be reasonably necessary or appropriate
in connection with such determination. In connection with such determination
by the Selected Accountants:   (i) each of the Buyer and the Company shall
have the right to (A) provide written documents and information to the
Selected Accountants so long as copies thereof are concurrently provided to
the other of them and (B) provide (by telephone or in person) oral
information (so long as a Representative of the Company and a Representative
of the Buyer are present at the time such information is provided) to the
Selected Accountants (except that this clause shall not restrict either of
them from providing administrative, ministerial or procedural
information);   (ii) the Selected Accountants shall be bound by amounts and
calculations that shall have previously become final and binding as described
in this Section 2.6, shall act as experts (and not as arbitrators) and shall
set forth their determination in a written document (which shall
include reasonably detailed supporting analysis and shall be delivered
simultaneously to the Buyer and the Company); and   27     (iii) the
determination of the Selected Accountants shall be final and binding (absent
manifest error), and such determination shall be non-appealable and
incontestable and not subject to collateral attack for any reason.  The
Buyer and the Company shall have the right at any time to agree in writing to
terminate the engagement of the Selected Accountants. If the
Selected Accountants are so engaged, the Closing Date, if necessary, shall be
postponed until the third Business Day following the later of receipt by the
Company and the Buyer of such determination by the Selected Accountants and
the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the
Parties set forth in Article 7 (other than conditions with respect to actions
contemplated to be taken at the Closing itself) or such other date as the
Company and the Buyer may mutually agree.   SECTION 2.7. TREATMENT OF
EQUITY INTERESTS.   (a) Without any requirement to duplicate the
disclosure required by Section 5.6(a), promptly after the date hereof and
thereafter from time to time prior to and on the Closing Date, upon
reasonable written request from the Buyer, the Company shall provide to the
Buyer an updated list that identifies each Equity Interest in the Company
outstanding as of the date of such list and anticipated to be outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including options, warrants and
shares of Common Stock) and, to the extent applicable thereto, the name of
the record holder thereof, the number of shares of Common Stock subject
thereto, the plan under which such Equity Interest was issued, the exercise
price thereof, the extent to which such Equity Interest is or as of the
Effective Time will be vested, the vesting schedule therefor, the grant date
related thereto, and the expiration date related thereto.   (b) For purposes
of calculating the Per Share Merger Consideration and each of the components
thereof and payments in respect thereof, the shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall include all
shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of options or
warrants outstanding at the Effective Time. If any certificates representing
shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of options or warrants exercised
prior to the Effective Time shall not have been issued as of the Effective
Time, the Person in whose name such certificates would have been issued shall
not be required to deliver any certificates (or any affidavit (or agreement
or arrangement) described in Section 2.5(f)) in respect of the shares so
issued with his Letter of Transmittal and, in lieu thereof, shall be required
to deliver a duly executed and completed certificate, in such form as the
Company shall reasonably prescribe, confirming such exercise and the fact
that such certificates have not been received by such holder.   (c) Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take or cause to be taken all such actions necessary or appropriate in its
good faith determination so that all Equity Interests that do not, by their
terms, expire on or before the Effective Time (other than shares of Common
Stock and Equity Interests which shall have then been exercised), regardless
of whether such Equity Interests are vested or would vest prior to or on the
Effective Time, are:   (i) fully vested and exercised (including
exercises contingent upon consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (however described) and exercise where   28    payment of the
exercise price is funded by a portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Common Stock issued upon such exercise);
or   (ii) otherwise cancelled without any shares of Common Stock being
issued or outstanding or deemed to be issued or outstanding immediately prior
the Effective Time in respect thereof.   (d) For purposes of calculating the
Per Share Merger Consideration and payments in respect thereof, to the extent
that payment of the exercise price of any Equity Interest exercised prior to
or as of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (that does
not, by its terms, expire prior to the Effective Time) is to be funded by a
portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, the
Closing Adjustment shall be determined as if such exercise price had been
paid prior to the Effective Time.   (e) On the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide (i) to the Exchange Agent and the Buyer a list that identifies
each Equity Interest in the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including options, warrants and shares of Common Stock) and,
to the extent applicable thereto, the name of the record holder thereof, the
number of shares of Common Stock subject thereto, the exercise price thereof,
the extent to which such Equity Interest shall have been exercised prior to
or as of the Effective Time and the extent to which the exercise price
thereof shall have been paid prior to or as of the Effective Time or is to be
funded by a portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof and (ii) pursuant to the Exchange Agency Agreement, to the Exchange
Agent written instructions directing the Exchange Agent to withhold from the
Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of Equity Interests, as to
which the exercise price thereof shall not have been paid prior to or as of
the Effective Time or is to be funded by a portion of the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof, an amount equal to such exercise

INFORMATION STATEMENT.   (a) Immediately following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to (i) set 12:00 a.m. (New York Time) on February 8, 2006 as the
record time and date for determining the holders of record of shares of
Common Stock entitled to act on adoption of this Agreement and (ii) cause the
Majority Stockholders to execute and deliver the Written Consents. Adoption
of this Agreement by the holders of record of the requisite number of shares
of Common Stock is called the   67  "Company Stockholder Approval". The
Company shall promptly give written notice to the Buyer of such record time
and date and receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval.   (b) Promptly
following receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company shall
prepare a notice of the Company Stockholder Approval and an information
statement, to be mailed or otherwise distributed to the holders of record of
shares of Common Stock entitled to notice of the Company
Stockholder Approval, which shall describe the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated hereby and any approval by the Majority Stockholders of the
ancillary matters, this Agreement and the adoption thereof by the Board of
Directors of the Company and the Majority Stockholders and notify such
holders of any dissenters\' appraisal rights to which they may be entitled
under applicable Law (the "Information Statement"). The Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Information Statement to comply
in all material respects with the informational requirements of applicable
Law.   (c) The Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiary will promptly provide to
the Company such information concerning themselves, their Affiliates,
the transactions contemplated hereby and related matters as the Company
may reasonably request for inclusion in the Information Statement (or any
amendment or supplement described in Section 6.4(e)) and otherwise promptly
cooperate with the Company in the preparation thereof. The Company shall
provide the Buyer with a copy of the Information Statement (or any amendment
or supplement described in Section 6.4(e)) a reasonable time prior to the
first mailing or other distribution thereof pursuant to Section 6.4(d) and
shall consider in good faith any comments that the Buyer may have thereon.
The Company shall not mail or otherwise distribute the Information Statement
to such holders without the Buyer\'s prior written approval (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (d) The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Information Statement (or any
amendment or supplement described in Section 6.4(e)) and the Letter of
Transmittal to be mailed or otherwise distributed to such holders at a time
and in a manner that complies in all material respects with the procedural
requirements of applicable Law and otherwise at a time that it in good faith
believes will not unduly delay the Closing beyond the Closing Date then
anticipated in good faith by it; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, if an amendment or supplement
described in Section 6.4(e) is to be mailed or otherwise distributed, the
Company may delay the Closing to the extent that it in good faith
determines to be necessary or appropriate by reason thereof. The Company
shall also concurrently mail or otherwise distribute the Information
Statement (and any amendment or supplement described in Section 6.4(e)), and
the Letter of Transmittal to all other holders of record of Equity Interests
(other than shares of Common Stock) in the Company.   (e) If, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any Party determines that the Information
Statement contains or may contain a misstatement of a material fact or omits
or may omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, such Party shall promptly so advise the
other Parties. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company
determines that the Information Statement contains a misstatement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Company    68  shall
prepare an amendment or supplement to the Information Statement so that, as
amended or supplemented, the Information Statement does not contain such
a misstatement or omission.   (f) The Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiary shall
indemnify the Company, its directors, its officers and any Person that
controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act
or Section 20 of the Exchange Act for, and hold them harmless from and
against, any and all Liabilities and Losses arising out of any misstatement
of a material fact in the Information Statement or omission to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading to the extent that such misstatement or omission is based on
information which they provide for inclusion in the Information Statement
(including payment, as incurred, of legal fees and expenses in connection
with any Claim or Proceeding or any investigation by the Company in respect
thereof).   (g) The Company shall indemnify the Buyer and the Buyer
Subsidiary, their directors, their officers and any Person that controls the
Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiary within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act for, and hold them harmless
from and against, any and all Liabilities and Losses arising out of any
misstatement of a material fact in the Information Statement or omission to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading to the extent that such misstatement or omission is based on
information which was not provided by the Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiary for
inclusion in the Information Statement (including payment, as incurred, of
legal fees and expenses in connection with any Claim or Proceeding or any
investigation by the Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiary in respect thereof).  
SECTION 6.5. LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL. The Information Statement shall be
accompanied by a letter of transmittal (with instructions for its use), in
a form to be prepared by the Company and acceptable to the Buyer and the
Exchange Agent (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), for holders of record of shares of Common Stock and other
outstanding Equity Interests in the Company to use in surrendering their
shares of Common Stock, exercising their Equity Interests (other than shares
of Common Stock) or their dissenters\' appraisal rights, or selling (as
contemplated by Section 2.7(g)) such Equity Interests in connection with the
Merger (the "Letter of Transmittal"). The Letter of Transmittal shall include
a customary release by each such holder of any Claims against the Parties and
the Subsidiaries that such holder has or may have in its capacity as such a
holder, including Claims with respect to the allocation of the Merger
Consideration among such holders, except for claims to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
claims in respect of duly exercised dissenters\' appraisal rights that are
not subsequently withdrawn or lost. Surrender of such shares and Equity
Interests pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal prior to the Effective Time
shall be contingent upon the consummation of the transactions set forth in
the Information Statement on substantially the same terms as set forth in the
Information Statement and this Agreement.   SECTION 6.6. NO SOLICITATION;
OTHER OFFERS.    69   (a) Subject to Section 6.6(b), the Company shall
not, and shall not authorize or permit any of the Subsidiaries or any of its
or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission of an Acquisition
Proposal from a Person or Group (other than the Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiary
or any of their Affiliates), (ii) engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, furnish non-public information relating to the Company or
any Subsidiary to, or provide access to the non-public Company Business

it is seeking to submit, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into a Contract
or letter of intent (except for a confidentiality agreement described in
Section 6.6(b)) with any Person or Group (other than the Buyer, the Buyer

the Company that it is seeking to submit, an Acquisition Proposal (A) with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate
or fail to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company, the Subsidiaries and their Representatives
will immediately cease any and all activities, discussions or negotiations
with any Third Parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal.  As promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 48 hours)
after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information or inquiry which it reasonably believes would lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Buyer oral and written notice
of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person or Group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and a copy of all written materials provided in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company
(through one or more of its Representatives) or the Board of Directors of the
Company may, prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, but only to
the extent that the Company has not breached its obligations under clause (i)
of Section 6.6(a), (i) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations
with any Person or Group (or with the Representatives of any Third Party)
that has submitted, or has informed the Company that it is seeking to submit,
an Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in violation of Section 6.6(a)
and constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal (which Person or Group is called a "Qualified Third Party"), (ii)
furnish non-public information relating to the Company or any Subsidiary and
provide access to the Company Business Records and the Real Property to any
Qualified Third Party or its Representatives pursuant to an executed
confidentiality agreement containing customary nondisclosure provisions,
(iii) withdraw the Company Board Recommendation or modify the Company Board
Recommendation in any manner (including a manner adverse to the Buyer and the
Buyer Subsidiary), (iv) take any action in respect of the matters described
in Section 9.2 which the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company in
good faith determines is necessary or appropriate so that the Company would
have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Sections 9.1(j)
and 9.2, (v) terminate this Agreement pursuant and subject to Section 9.1(j),
(vi) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the
Company, one or more of the Representatives of the Company or the Board of
Directors of the Company to take, (vii) take any action in respect of the
Information Statement, the Company Stockholder Approval or the other matters
described in this Article 6 which the Company or the Board of Directors of
the Company in good faith determines is necessary or appropriate by reason of
the occurrence of any action described in the preceding clause (iii), (iv),
(v) or (vi), or    70  (viii) engage in any combination of activities
described in the preceding clauses of this sentence; provided, however, that
the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company shall not, and shall
not authorize or permit their Representatives to, take any action described
in the preceding clause (iii) or (v) unless the Board of Directors of the
Company in good faith determines by a majority vote, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.   SECTION 6.7. FULFILLMENT OF CONDITIONS. Subject to Section 6.6,
each Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill or cause
to be fulfilled the conditions set forth in Article 7.   SECTION 6.8.
NOTICE OF DEVELOPMENTS.   (a) Solely for purposes of determining whether the
Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiary is entitled to monetary contractual damages as
a result of a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth in Article 5 of this Agreement, if at any time prior to the Closing the
Company becomes aware of any information resulting from or related to facts,
circumstances or developments that occur after the date hereof ("Subsequent
Events"), which should be added to, deducted from or otherwise reflected in a
change to, any disclosure previously made in this Agreement or any Schedule
in order that any such representation or warranty of the Company shall not be
inaccurate or incomplete, the Company shall have the right to give prompt
written notice to Buyer of such Subsequent Events, and may amend any Schedule
to make such addition, deletion or change, provided that such notice must
specifically reference this Section 6.8 and must clearly identify the
Subsequent Event and representation or warranty so amended. A notice given
pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall be deemed to have amended the applicable
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement and
the Schedules as of the date such notice is provided to the Buyer. The
failure to have reflected the facts, circumstances or developments
constituting the Subsequent Event at the time of execution of this Agreement
shall not be deemed to have constituted a breach of any such representation
or warranty when originally made and the Company shall have no Liability to
the Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiary for monetary contractual damages with
respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.8
or otherwise shall permit the Company to update any of its representations
and warranties (or any related Schedule) contained in this Agreement after
the date hereof for purposes of curing any failure of a closing condition or
curing any termination right that has arisen as a result of a breach of the
Company\'s representations and warranties contained in this Agreement.  
(b) The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Buyer of

of the occurrence of any development known to it or its Representatives that
has had or is reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or has
caused or is reasonably expected to cause a failure to satisfy any of the
conditions set forth in Article 7.    71   SECTION 6.9. TERMINATION OF

Agreement dated March 28, 2002 by and among the Company, certain

be included in the calculation of the Closing Adjustment as provided in the
definition therein.   (b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from GMAC Commercial Finance LLC full and unconditional
releases of all Liens of the lenders under the Credit Facility together with

record with respect to such releases.   SECTION 6.10. FURTHER ASSURANCES.
Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, at the request
of any other Party, cooperate with such other Party by furnishing additional
information, executing and delivering additional documents and instruments
and undertaking such additional actions as may be reasonably required by such
other Party or its counsel to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all Permits, Consents and Orders of Governmental Authorities and all Consents
of parties to Contracts with the Company or a Subsidiary which may be
necessary or appropriate for the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to avoid termination or
cancellation of such Contracts, to avoid suspension or loss of authorizations
under Permits held by the Company or any Subsidiary and to fulfill the
conditions set forth in Article 7.   SECTION 6.11. TERMINATION ON CLOSING.
The obligations of the Parties under this Article 6 (other than under the
last and second from the last sentences of Section 6.2(e)) shall terminate
upon consummation of the Closing.   SECTION 6.12. 2005 AUDITED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
prepare and cause the Accountants to audit and deliver an unqualified report
on the 2005 Audited Financial Statements as promptly as reasonably
practicable. The Buyer recognizes that the 2005 Audited Financial Statements
will reflect the divestitures of CRS, EMS and International IVS and the sale
of the EMS Adjacent Property in accordance with GAAP and agrees that
differences between the 2005 Audited Financial Statements and the financial
statements set forth on Schedule 6.12 by reason of the fact that the
financial statements set forth on Schedule 6.12 may have been adjusted to
include or exclude as appropriate financial information related to CRS, EMS,
International IVS or the EMS Adjacent Property or may have reflected
anticipated costs or savings expected to result from such divestitures or the
related restructurings, shall not constitute a Material Adverse Effect. It is
agreed and understood that the adjustments expected to result from
such divestitures and restructurings and which will not be reflected in the
2005 Audited Financial Statements are (a) an approximately $7.0 million
expense run rate reduction adjustment and (b) an approximately $1.0 million
of positive EBITDA related to the divestiture of International IVS.
Additionally, it is agreed and understood that any adjustment which may
result from the audit of the Company\'s 2005 Financial Statements related to
the portion of software development costs that are capitalized in accordance
with GAAP, will not be considered as a material change.    72   SECTION
6.13. CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS LEASE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in Section 6.2, the Company shall, in cooperation with the Buyer and at its
direction, provide the termination notice permitted by the Real Property
Lease for the Company\'s corporate headquarters and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a short-term extension of such Real Property
Lease and, if unsuccessful in obtaining such extension despite using such
commercially reasonable efforts, shall hold over and thereby effect a month-
to-month tenancy of the office space covered thereby. Failure to obtain any
such extension despite using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the same, and any summary process action commenced by the landlord as a
result of holding over, shall not constitute a failure to satisfy any
condition under Article 7. The Company and the Buyer shall discuss in good
faith a reasonable course of action (taking into account the perspectives of
both the Company and the Buyer) to ensure that the Company will have
headquarters office space meeting its needs and to avoid material disruption
or Loss with respect to the Business or the Employees in the event of an
unexpected delay in the Closing beyond April 1, 2006 or the failure of the
Buyer to give timely direction. If the Company and the Buyer cannot agree as
to a course of action, the Company may take commercially reasonable action as
it may consider necessary to satisfy such needs. Buyer agrees to reimburse
the Company for all reasonable costs incurred by the Company prior to March
1, 2006 with respect to any such actions (other than all termination or other
fees payable to the landlord under such Real Property Lease because such
termination notice is given). All amounts which the Buyer is obligated to
reimburse to the Company hereunder which have not been so reimbursed prior to
March 1, 2006 will be included in the calculation of the Closing Adjustment
as provided therein.   SECTION 6.14. SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL STOCK. The Company
will use commercially reasonable efforts so that at the Effective Time, the
Company directly or indirectly owns 100% of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of and other Equity Interests in each of the Subsidiaries,
including Phoenix International Limited and Phoenix Company Limited;
provided, however, that the failure to so own 100% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock and equity interests of the Subsidiaries shall not
constitute a failure to satisfy any condition under Article 7.   ARTICLE

required pursuant to WARN for any "employment loss" (as defined in WARN) and

cause the Subsidiaries to, (a) provide full access to such Company Business
Records by then current or former directors or executive officers of the
Company (and Representatives of such directors and officers) for purposes of
investigation, prosecution or defense of any Claim or Proceeding and (b) make
their Representatives available to them for such purposes, in each case at no
charge to them.   SECTION 8.3. INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) All
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation with
respect to actions or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
benefiting (i) current    76  or former directors or officers of the
Company or individuals serving at the request of the Company as a current or

From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain
in full force and effect, for the benefit of the Company Indemnified Persons,
with respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to or as of the
Effective Time, one or more policies of directors\' and officers\' liability

favorable to the Company Indemnified Persons than the policies of directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance which are maintained by the Company as of
the date hereof and are set forth on Schedule 5.28 (the "Existing Coverage");
provided, however, that the Buyer may fulfill its obligation under this
Section 8.3(c) by purchasing, for an aggregate price not to exceed 225%
of the premium paid by the Company for the Existing Coverage for 2005 (the

notice to the Buyer of its intention to do so and (ii) the Company shall have
requested the Buyer\'s written consent thereto (which shall not be

consolidates with or merges into one or more other Persons and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or other entity of such

to one or more other Persons (other than in the Ordinary Course), then,
in    77  each such case and as a condition precedent to the consummation
thereof, proper provision shall be made so that each such successor and
assign shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.3.   (e)
The rights of each Company Indemnified Person under this Section 8.3 shall be

SECTION 8.4. PAYMENT OF CREDITORS. After the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
use commercially reasonably efforts to pay or discharge debts and obligations
of the Company as of the Effective Time when due, and not to render the

Agreement may be terminated:   (a) at any time prior to the Effective Time,

substantially on the terms contemplated by this Agreement;   (c) by the
Buyer if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained within
10 days after the date hereof; provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.1(c) shall not be available to the Buyer

caused by the action or failure to act of the Buyer and such action or
failure to act constitutes a material breach by the Buyer of
this Agreement;   (d) at any time after July 31, 2006 (the "Termination
Date") and prior to the Effective Time, by the Buyer if (i) the Closing shall
not have been consummated on or before the Termination Date and (ii) the
failure to consummate the Closing on or before the Termination Date did not
result from the failure by the Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiary to perform or
comply with any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement required to
be performed or complied with prior to the Closing by the Buyer or the Buyer
Subsidiary;   (e) at any time after the Termination Date and prior to
the Effective Time, by the Company, if (i) the Closing shall not have
been consummated on or before the Termination Date and (ii) the failure to
consummate the Closing on or before the Termination Date did not   
78  result from the failure by the Company to perform or comply with any

become untrue and, in each case, if such breach cannot be or has not been
cured by the Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiary, in all material respects, prior
to the earlier of the date that is 30 days after written notice thereof shall
have been given to the Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiary or the Termination
Date;   (h) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by the Buyer, if
the Company or any "significant subsidiary" of the Company, within the
meaning of Regulation S-X adopted under the Exchange Act, shall be or become

any such "significant subsidiary" commences or there is commenced against the
Company or any such "significant subsidiary" a case under the United States
Bankruptcy Code;   (i) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by the
Company, if the Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiary shall be or become bankrupt or

Subsidiary a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code;   (j) at any
time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, subject to Section

Company to accept or enter into a Qualified Superior Contract; or   (k) by
the Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiary, if a Material Adverse Effect shall have
occurred and be continuing since the date hereof, if such Material Adverse
Effect cannot be or has not been cured by the Company prior to the earlier of

to the Company or the Termination Date.   SECTION 9.2. SUPERIOR

behalf of the Company and (2) contains no conditions (other than the
condition that this Agreement be terminated and the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 that shall not then have been satisfied or waived) or (B) the
Buyer shall have submitted such a Contract within such three Business Days,
but the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith shall have
determined, after consultation with its financial advisors, that
such Contract is not at least as favorable to the holders of outstanding
shares of Common Stock as the Qualified Superior Contract.   (b) The
Company shall not enter into any Qualified Superior Contract prior to the
expiration of the three Business Days set forth in Section 9.2(a).   SECTION
9.3. EFFECT OF TERMINATION.   (a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant

by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with written
instructions given by the Buyer to the Company for that purpose. The Parties
agree that the Company Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages and not
penalties. Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and

their respective liabilities, duties and obligations under this Agreement
exceed 20% of the Buyer Payment.   (i) Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the reimbursement obligations under Sections 6.2(b),
6.3(a) and 6.13 shall survive any termination of the Agreement and shall not
be subject to Section 9.3(h).   ARTICLE 10   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS  
SECTION 10.1. PUBLICITY. Except to the extent necessary or appropriate as in
good faith determined by the Company to enable it to exercise its rights and
perform its obligations    81  under Sections 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 and 9.2 and
subject to Section 10.3(c), each Party agrees that it shall not and shall not
permit its Affiliates or Representatives to issue any publicity, release or
announcement concerning the execution, delivery, performance or termination
of this Agreement, the provisions hereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the form and content of such
publicity, release or announcement by the Company and the Buyer; provided,
however, that no such consent shall be required when such publicity, release
or announcement is required by any applicable Law or Order; and, provided
further, that, prior to issuing any publicity, release or announcement
without such prior written consent, the Party issuing or whose Affiliates or
Representatives is issuing such publicity, release or announcement shall have
given reasonable prior notice to the other Parties of such intended issuance
and shall have in good faith considered their comments thereon.   SECTION
10.2. [RESERVED.]   SECTION 10.3. COMPLIANCE WITH RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.  
(a) The Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, acknowledge that money damages and other damages at law for a
breach or threatened breach of Section 10.1 (collectively, the "Restrictive
Covenants") by it or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is unlikely to
be calculable, that such a breach or threatened breach is likely to cause
irreparable harm to the other of them and that remedies at law are likely to
be inadequate and insufficient to protect the other of them against any
such actual or threatened breach. Accordingly, each Party, on behalf of
itself and its Representatives, agrees to the granting of specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies in favor of each
other Party in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, without
proof of actual damages and without the requirement to post any bond or other
security. Such performance, relief and remedies shall not be the exclusive
remedy for a breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants by a
Party or its Affiliates or Representatives, but shall be in addition to all
other rights and remedies available at law, in equity or otherwise. If a
court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, non-appealable order
that the Restrictive Covenants have been breached by a Party or its
Affiliates or Representatives, the breaching Party will or will cause its
Affiliates or Representatives to reimburse the injured Party for all costs
and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such litigation and all other litigation related to such
breach.   (b) At the request of a Party, a senior executive officer of
each other Party shall promptly deliver written certification to such Party

duties under this Agreement (by operation of Law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the Company (in case of the Buyer or the Buyer
Subsidiary) or of the Buyer (in case of the Company). Any assignment of
rights or delegation of duties under this Agreement by a Party without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, if such consent is required

Agreement), the Exhibits, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Related
Agreements, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and cancels and supersedes all of the previous
or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties and understandings
(whether oral or written) by, between or among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.   (b) Each Party agrees and acknowledges that for
all purposes under this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement that (i)
all covenants and agreements of the parties to the Confidentiality Agreement
thereunder shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) the rights and obligations of the Buyer Subsidiary
under the Confidentiality Agreement shall be equivalent to the rights and
obligations that the Buyer has under the Confidentiality Agreement, as if the
Buyer Subsidiary were originally party to the Confidentiality Agreement
alongside the Buyer and (iii) the rights and obligations of the Company under
the Confidentiality Agreement shall be the same as if the Company had been a
party to the Confidentiality Agreement.   SECTION 10.10. AMENDMENTS. No
addition to, and no cancellation, renewal, extension, modification or
amendment of, this Agreement shall be binding upon a Party unless such
addition, cancellation, renewal, extension, modification or amendment is set
forth in a written instrument which states that it adds to, cancels, renews,
extends, modifies or amends this Agreement and which is executed and
delivered on behalf of each Party by an officer of, or attorney-in-fact for,
such Party or, in the case of the Buyer Subsidiary, the Buyer.    86  
SECTION 10.11. WAIVERS. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
binding upon a Party, unless such waiver is expressly set forth in a written
instrument which is executed and delivered on behalf of the Company by an
officer of, or attorney-in-fact for, the Company (in the case of a waiver
by the Company) or the Buyer by an officer of, or attorney-in-fact for, the
Buyer (in the case of a waiver by the Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiary). Such
waiver shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such
written instrument. Neither the exercise (from time to time and at any time)
by a Party of, nor the delay or failure (at any time or for any period of
time) to exercise, any right, power or remedy shall constitute a waiver of
the right to exercise, or impair, limit or restrict the exercise of, such
right, power or remedy or any other right, power or remedy at any time and
from time to time thereafter. No waiver of any right, power or remedy of a
Party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other right, power or remedy of
such Party or shall, except to the extent so waived, impair, limit or
restrict the exercise of such right, power or remedy.   SECTION 10.12.
REMEDIES. Except as limited by Section 9.3(h), the rights, powers and
remedies of a Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of any
other rights, powers or remedies, including specific performance, injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies, that may be available to such Party, at
law, in equity or otherwise, for a breach of or default under this
Agreement.   SECTION 10.13. HEADINGS; COUNTERPARTS; INTERPRETATION;
SCHEDULES.   (a) The headings set forth herein have been inserted for
convenience of reference only, shall not be considered a part of this
Agreement and shall not limit, modify or affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.   (b) This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which (when executed and delivered) shall
constitute an original instrument, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective and be
deemed to have been executed and delivered by all of the Parties at such time
as counterparts shall have been executed and delivered by each of the
Parties, regardless of whether each of the Parties has executed the same
counterpart. It shall not be necessary when making proof of this Agreement to
account for any counterparts other than a sufficient number of counterparts
which, when taken together, contain signatures of all of the Parties.
Delivery of a counterpart by facsimile shall be as effective as delivery of
an original.   (c) All Parties have participated substantially in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and no ambiguity herein shall be
construed against the draftsman. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in
any of the Schedules shall constitute or be interpreted or construed as an
admission by any Party or any of its Affiliates of liability to third
parties, whether under any Law, Contract or Permit, or otherwise, or as an
admission that any Party or any of its Affiliates are in violation or breach
of or default under, or have ever violated, breached or defaulted under, any
Law, Contract or Permit.   (d) Disclosure made in any Schedule with
reasonable clarity and particularity as to matters covered, or required or
contemplated to be covered, in any other Schedule is hereby incorporated by
reference into all such other Schedules to the extent the relevance of
such    87  disclosure to another Schedule is readily and plainly
apparent on its face. The Schedules and the information and disclosures
contained in such Schedules are intended only to qualify and limit the
representations and warranties of the Company contained herein and shall not
be deemed to expand in any way the scope of any such representation or
warranty. The disclosure of any matter in the Schedules does not constitute
an acknowledgment that such matter is required to be disclosed or is material
within the meaning of the representations and warranties contained herein, or
otherwise. The inclusion of any information in the Schedules shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment that such information is material
or outside the Ordinary Course and the omission of any information from any
Schedule or any representation or warranty shall not be deemed to be a
statement or acknowledgement that such information is not material or is
within the Ordinary Course. ACCORDINGLY, INVESTORS IN AND LENDERS AND
CREDITORS TO THE BUYER, THE BUYER SUBSIDIARY OR THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT
RELY ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR SCHEDULES FOR ANY PURPOSE.  
SECTION 10.14. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement shall
hereafter be held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, in whole or
in part, in any jurisdiction under any circumstances for any reason, (a)
such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to cause
such provision to be valid, enforceable and legal while preserving the intent
of the Parties as expressed in, and the benefits to the Parties provided by,
this Agreement or (b) if such provision cannot be so reformed, such provision
shall be severed from this Agreement and an equitable adjustment shall be
made to this Agreement (including addition of necessary further provisions to
this Agreement) so as to give effect to the intent so expressed and the
benefits so provided. Such holding shall not affect or impair the validity,
enforceability or legality of such provision in any other jurisdiction or
under any other circumstances. Neither such holding nor such reformation nor
severance shall affect or impair the legality, validity or enforceability of
any other provision of this Agreement.    [REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY
LEFT BLANK]    88   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have duly executed
and delivered this Agreement as of the date first above written.
