1.4   _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not assume and shall not be
obligated to assume or be obliged to pay, perform, discharge or otherwise
satisfy any Liability, Claim or Encumbrance of Sellers, and Sellers shall be

but not limited to all accounts payable, accrued expenses, Taxes (except

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

any other Liabilities to any of Seller's Employees under Seller's employee
stock option plan;

  



  

(h)  all Liabilities for expenses (i) relating to the
negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and (ii) relating to
the Transactions, in each case to the extent incurred by Seller and including

fees and disbursements;

  



  

(i)  any Liability to DMS (other than pursuant to an Assumed
Contract, if any, with DMS);

any breach, occurrence or circumstance that occurred prior to the Closing; and

  



  

(k)  all Liabilities with respect to any Employee or other
Benefit Plans.

  



  

The parties hereto acknowledge that Buyer is not agreeing to assume any
Liability of any Seller whether related to the Assets or otherwise, other than
the Assumed Liabilities, and that nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as an agreement otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
of any conflict between the terms of _Section 1.3_ and this _Section 1.4_ ,
the terms of _Section 1.3_ shall govern.

  



  

1.5   _Cure Costs_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall pay
or cause to be paid, pursuant to and in accordance with section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code and the Sale Order, any and all cure and reinstatement costs
or expenses relating to the assignment and assumption of the Assigned
Contracts and Assigned Leases and Interests (the " _Cure Costs_ ") to which
any Seller is a party and which are included in the Assets.

  



  

1.6   _Assignment of Assets Subject to Consent Requirements_. If
prior to the Closing Date any consent to assignment applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than governmental consents or
approvals customarily obtained post-Closing) has not been obtained or
otherwise satisfied, and further, failure to obtain or otherwise satisfy such
third party consent would result in termination of a Lease, or would cause a
Lease to be void or voidable, in each case after giving effect to the Sale
Order and the Bankruptcy Code (each such third party consent, a " _Hard
Consent_ "), the Properties affected by such Hard Consent shall be held back
from the Assets conveyed at Closing without reduction to the Base Purchase
Price. Any Property so held back at the Closing will be conveyed to Buyer
within ten (10) Business Days after such Hard Consent has been obtained or
otherwise satisfied. At such subsequent closing, Sellers shall contribute,
assign, transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall acquire and accept from
Sellers, such Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Except for
Hard Consents, if any consents to the assignment of any Asset are not
obtained prior to Closing, then with respect to each affected Asset, the
affected Assets shall nevertheless be sold and conveyed to Buyer at the
Closing and Buyer shall pay for the affected Asset(s) at Closing in
accordance with this Agreement as though the Consent had been obtained. In the
case of licenses, certificates, approvals, authorizations, Leases, Contracts
and other commitments included in the Assets (a) that cannot be transferred or
assigned without the Hard Consent of third parties, which Hard

  



    

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

Consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing (after giving effect to
the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), Sellers shall, at Buyer's sole
expense and subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be
required, reasonably cooperate with Buyer in attempting to obtain such
Hard Consent and, if any such Hard Consent is not obtained, Sellers shall,
following the Closing, at Buyer's sole expense and subject to any approval of
the Bankruptcy Court that may be required, cooperate with Buyer in all
reasonable respects to provide to Buyer the benefits thereof in some other
manner or (b) that are otherwise not transferable or assignable (after giving
effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), Sellers shall, following
the Closing, at Buyer's sole expense and subject to any approval of the
Bankruptcy Court that may be required, reasonably cooperate with Buyer to
provide to Buyer the benefits thereof in some other manner (including the
exercise of the rights of Sellers thereunder); _provided_ that Buyer bears the
burdens in each case of (a) or (b); _provided_ _further_ that nothing in this
_Section 1.6_ shall (i) require Sellers to make any expenditure or incur any
obligation on its own or on behalf of Buyer for which funds in the full amount
of such expenditure or obligation are not provided to Sellers by Buyer in
advance in cash or (ii) prohibit Sellers from ceasing operations or winding
up its affairs following the Closing.

  



  

1.7   _Consents for Assigned Contracts_. For all purposes of this
Agreement (including all representations and warranties of Sellers contained
herein), Sellers shall be deemed to have obtained all required consents in
respect of the assumption and assignment of any Assigned Contract if, and to
the extent that, (i) Sellers have properly served under the Bankruptcy Code
notice of assumption and assignment on the counterparty to such Assigned
Contract, (ii) any objections to assumption and assignment filed by such
counterparty have been withdrawn or overruled (including pursuant to the Sale
Order or other Order of the Bankruptcy Court), and (iii) pursuant to the Sale
Order, Sellers are authorized to assume and assign such Assigned Contracts to
Buyer pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and any applicable Cure
Costs have been satisfied by Buyer or Seller, on behalf of Sellers, as
provided in this Agreement. Sellers shall, as part of the Sale Motion, seek
the assumption and assignment to Buyer of the Assigned Leases and Interests
and the Assigned Contracts.

  



  

1.8   _Further Assurances_. The Parties agree to (a) furnish upon
request to each other such further information, (b) execute, acknowledge and
deliver to each other such other documents and (c) do such other acts and
things, all as the other Party may reasonably request for the purpose of
effectuating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents; _provided_  that Sellers' ability to perform covenants
and obligations after Closing, shall be limited to the extent Sellers have
employees and resources available for such purpose; _provided_ _further_ that
nothing in this _Section 1.8_ shall prohibit Sellers from ceasing operations
or winding up its affairs following the Closing.

  



  

Article 2 _ 
 Purchase Price_

  



  

2.1   _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the purchase,
sale, assignment and conveyance of Sellers' right, title and interest in, to
and under the Assets shall consist of the following (collectively, the "
_Base Purchase Price_ "):

  



    

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(a)  cash in an amount equal to seventy-three million dollars
($73,000,000.00), less the aggregate amount of all Cure Costs, if any, for
Leases or Contracts (i) to which EOX is a party, (ii) DMS is a counterparty,
(iii) as contemplated by _Section 1.1(b)(xiii)_, or (iv) Assigned Leases and
Interests; and

  



  

(b)  the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
provided in _Sections 7.12_ through _7.14_ (as adjusted, the "
_Purchase Price_ ").

  



  

2.2   _Deposit_. Prior to or substantially concurrent with the
execution of this Agreement (or, in the event that the Escrow Agent is not
prepared to accept the Deposit on the date hereof, as soon as the Escrow Agent
is so prepared, including that the Parties have satisfied its "know your
customer" and other compliance requirements and provided its wire
instructions), Buyer has paid or shall pay to Sellers, to be held in escrow
by the Escrow Agent, by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds, a
deposit in the amount of three million six hundred and fifty thousand dollars
($3,650,000) (the " _Deposit_ "). The Deposit shall not be subject to any
lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of Sellers or Buyer. If Closing occurs, the Deposit shall be
credited against the amount required to be paid by Buyer to Sellers at
Closing. If this Agreement is terminated by Sellers prior to Closing pursuant
to _Section 10.1(c)(i)_, or the conditions to the obligations of Buyer to
consummate the Closing set forth in _Article 8_ shall have been expressly
waived in writing by Buyer or satisfied, but Buyer shall have failed to
perform its obligations under _Section 3.3_ after notice as provided in
_Section 10.1(c)(i)_ , then the Deposit shall be retained by Sellers as
liquidated damages (and not as a penalty). In all other circumstances,
including if Buyer is not the Successful Bidder, or the Bankruptcy Court does
not approve the Sale Order or the Bidding Procedures Order, if this Agreement
is terminated prior to Closing for any other reason, then Sellers shall
return the Deposit to Buyer within five (5) Business Days of such
termination.

  



  

Article 3 _ 
 Closing_

  



  

3.1   _Closing Date_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, the closing of the sale of the Assets, the assumption and
assignment of the Assigned Contracts and the Assigned Leases and Interests,
and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities contemplated hereby (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 am, Chicago Time, by electronic
exchange of documents ( _provided_ that if the Parties agree to an in-person
Closing, such Closing shall take place at the office of Kirkland and Ellis LLP
at 300 North LaSalle, Chicago, Illinois 60654 (or at such other location
as the Parties may mutually agree)), no later than three (3) Business Days
following the date on which the conditions set forth in  _Article 8_ and
_Article 9_ have been satisfied or (if permissible) waived (other than the
conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (if permissible) waiver of such
conditions). The date and time at which the Closing actually occurs is
hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."

  



  

3.2   _Payment on the Closing Date_.

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(a)  At the Closing, Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) the
cash components of the Base Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to _Section
7.13_, less the Deposit and the BLM Holdback, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified in writing by Sellers prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

(b)  At Closing, unless the Applicable BLM Leases have been
reinstated by the BLM, Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Sellers, to
be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent, by bank wire transfer of immediately
available funds, a deposit in the amount of Five Million Eight Hundred Fifty
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($5,850,000.00) (the " _BLM Holdback_ "), being
equal to the Allocated Values of the three (3) Wells affected by the BLM
Matters (Clark Griswold Federal 3-17-20H, Noonan Federal 3-18-19H, and Greg
Marmalard Federal 3-28-33H) (such Wells, being the " _Applicable BLM Wells_ ",
and the corresponding Leases, being the " _Applicable BLM Leases_ "). The BLM
Holdback shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any
other judicial process of any creditor of Sellers or Buyer other than any
validly perfected lien or attachment that existed as of the Sellers' petition
date or was granted pursuant to the Order of the Bankruptcy Court that
approved Sellers\' debtor-in-possession financing; _provided_ that any such
lien or attachment shall be solely to the extent of the Sellers' (and not
Buyer's) interest in the BLM Holdback, and Buyer's interest in the BLM
Holdback shall be free and clear of any such lien, attachment, trustee
process or any other judicial process of any creditor of Sellers or Buyer. At
Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, Sellers
shall assign to Buyer all of their right, title, and interest in and to all
Assets associated with the Applicable BLM Wells other than the Applicable BLM
Leases, which the Parties agree shall be retained by Sellers unless
reinstated prior to Closing or as otherwise permitted by BLM. At Closing, in
the event the Applicable BLM Leases have not been reinstated, Sellers shall
engage Buyer as a subcontractor (pursuant to a mutually agreeable contract
operating agreement in customary form) to undertake operating
responsibilities therefor and Buyer will (i) perform as a subcontractor the
obligations of Sellers as operator of the Applicable BLM Wells, associated
drilling spacing unit(s), and any other Assigned Leases and Interests
included therein through reinstatement and be responsible for any costs and
expenses related thereto, and (ii) receive any proceeds of production from
such Applicable BLM Well(s) and any other rights under the Applicable BLM
Leases as consideration for Buyer's subcontractor services, in each case, to
the extent permitted by the BLM and applicable Legal Requirements;. Within
three (3) Business Days after reinstatement of the Applicable BLM Leases, (i)
the Parties shall direct the Escrow Agent to release the BLM Holdback to
Sellers (or their assigns), and (ii) Sellers shall transfer the Applicable BLM
Leases to Buyer and reasonably cooperate with Buyer as required by the BLM in
order to complete the reinstatement and transfer of the Applicable BLM Leases
to Buyer. However, in the event of a final, non-appealable Order from BLM
that the Applicable BLM Leases cannot be reinstated, the Parties shall direct
the Escrow Agent to release the BLM Holdback to Buyer. Buyer shall, and shall
cause its employees to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with Sellers to seek
reinstatement of the Applicable BLM Wells. For clarification, the BLM
Holdback shall apply only to the Applicable BLM Leases and the Applicable BLM
Wells.

  



  

3.3   _Buyer 's Deliveries_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver

material to the Assets and Assumed Liabilities, taken as a whole, or impair,
prevent, or materially delay the ability of Sellers to consummate the Closing.

  



    

 | 13|

Article 5 _ 
 Representations and Warranties of Buyer_

  



  

Buyer represents and warrants to Sellers as follows.

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

5.1   _Organization and Good Standing_. Buyer is a limited
liability company, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware. Buyer has the requisite power and
authority to own or lease and to operate and use its properties and to carry
on its business as now conducted. Buyer is duly qualified or licensed to do
business in the State(s) where the Assets are located.

  



  

5.2   _Authority; Validity; Consents_. Buyer has the requisite
power and authority necessary to enter into and perform its obligations under
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Buyer and the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated herein have been duly
and validly authorized by all requisite limited liability company or
corporate actions in respect thereof. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Buyer and each other Transaction Document
to which Buyer is a Party will be duly and validly executed and delivered by
Buyer, as applicable, at the Closing. This Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which Buyer is a party constitute the legal, valid
and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with
their respective terms, except in each case as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance, moratorium or other similar Legal Requirements affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
equity, regardless of whether such principles are considered in a proceeding
at law or in equity. Buyer is not or will not be required to give any notice
to, make any filing with, or obtain any consent or approval from any Person
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a Party or the consummation or
performance of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except
for such notices, filings, consents, and approvals, the failure of which to
provide, make or obtain, would not, individually or in the aggregate, affect
Buyer's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

  



  

5.3   _No Conflict_. When the consents and other actions
described in _Section 5.2_ have been obtained and taken, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions provided for herein and therein will not
result in the breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a
default under, or conflict with, or cause any acceleration of any obligation
of Buyer under (a) any agreement, indenture or other instrument to which it
is bound, (b) the corporate governance documents of Buyer, (c) any Order or
(d) any Legal Requirement.

  



  

5.4   _Availability of Funds_. Buyer has, and as of the Closing
Buyer will have, sufficient cash in immediately available funds (without
giving effect to any unfunded financing, regardless of whether any such
financing is committed) to pay the Purchase Price, all costs, fees and
expenses to be paid by Buyer that are necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and
assume the Assumed Liabilities. Buyer's ability to consummate the
transaction contemplated hereby is not contingent upon its ability to secure
any financing (including the Financing) or to complete any public or private
placement of securities prior to or upon Closing. Buyer is and will be capable
of satisfying the conditions contained in sections 365(b)(1)(C) and 365(f) of
the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Assigned Contracts.

  



    

 | 18| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

5.5   _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, threatened, that would affect Buyer's ability to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  



  

5.6   _Bankruptcy_. There are no bankruptcy, reorganization or
arrangement proceedings pending, being contemplated by, or to the Knowledge
of Buyer, threatened against Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

5.7   _Brokers or Finders_. Neither Buyer nor any Person acting
on behalf of Buyer has paid or become obligated to pay any fee or commission
to any broker, finder, investment banker, agent or intermediary for or on
account of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Sellers
are or will become liable.

  



  

5.8   _Knowledge and Experience_. Buyer (a) is engaged in the
business of exploring for and producing Hydrocarbons as an ongoing business
and (b) is purchasing the Assets for its own account for investment purposes
and not with the intent to resell the Assets in violation of any federal or
state securities laws. Through its members, Buyer is an experienced and
knowledgeable investor in oil and gas properties, is knowledgeable with
respect to the tax ramifications associated therewith and herewith, has the
financial and business expertise to fully evaluate the merits and risks of the
transaction covered by this Agreement and has relied solely upon the basis of
its own independent investigation of the Assets for all purposes (including
the geologic and geophysical characteristics of the Assets, the estimated
Hydrocarbon reserves recoverable therefrom, and the price and expense
assumptions applicable thereto). In acquiring the Assets, Buyer is acting in
the conduct of its own business and not under any specific
contractual commitment to any third party, or any specific nominee agreement
with any third party, to transfer to, or to hold title on behalf of, such
third party, with respect to all or any part of the Assets. Buyer acknowledges
that it has had the opportunity to seek the advice of persons it deemed
appropriate concerning the consequences of the provisions of this Agreement
and hereby waives any and all rights to claim that it is an unsophisticated
investor in oil and gas properties.

  



  

5.9   _Qualification to Assume Operatorship_. At Closing, Buyer
will be qualified to own and, where applicable, assume operatorship of the
Assets in all jurisdictions where the Assets are located, and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause Buyer to be
disqualified as such an owner or operator. To the extent required by the
applicable state, tribal and federal Governmental Authorities, Buyer
currently has, and will continue to maintain, lease bonds, area-wide bonds
or any other surety bonds or insurance policies as may be required by, and in
accordance with, any Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction over the
ownership or operation of such Assets or any operating agreement.

Agreement Among Lenders dated February 5, 2016 among the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders), and (ii) to the extent permitted to be assigned under
applicable law, all claims, suits, causes of action and any other right of

whether known or unknown, arising under or in connection with the Credit
Agreement, any other documents or instruments delivered pursuant thereto or
the loan transactions governed thereby or in any way based on or related to
any of the foregoing, including contract claims, tort claims, malpractice
claims, statutory claims and all other claims at law or in equity related to
the rights and obligations sold and assigned pursuant to clause (i) above.
Undefined terms in this Section 5.10 have the same definitions set forth in
the Credit Agreement.

6.1   _Access and Reports_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, upon receipt of
written notice from Buyer of any such activities no less than two (2)

(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) to afford Buyer's officers and other
authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
through the Closing Date, to Sellers' employees, customers, suppliers,
properties, books, Contracts and Records, and, during such period,
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish promptly to
Buyer all information concerning the Assets as may reasonably be requested;
_provided_ that such access shall not interfere with the ordinary conduct of
business or the operation of the Assets, and at all times during such access,
Buyer's authorized Representatives shall be accompanied by at least one
(1) Representative of Sellers. All requests for information made pursuant to
this _Section 6.1_ shall be submitted in accordance with _Section 12.4_.
All such information shall be governed by the terms of the (and shall be

conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Assets. During the
Company's regular hours of business and after providing the Company with
written notice of any such activities no less than two (2) Business Days in
advance (which written notice shall include the written permission of the
operator (if other than a Seller) and any other third party whose permission
is legally required, which Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
attempting to secure), Buyer and its Representatives shall be permitted to
enter upon the Properties, inspect the Assets, review Sellers\' files and
records (other than those for which Seller has an attorney-client privilege)
relating to the Assets, and conduct visual, non-invasive tests, examinations
and investigations. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that sampling or other
invasive inspections of the Assets may not be conducted under any
circumstances and are not contemplated as part of the environmental diligence
for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers will have the
right, which they may exercise at their sole discretion, to (i) observe such

terms of the (and shall be considered "Information" under and as defined in)
Confidentiality Agreements.

  



  

(c)  This _Section 6.1_ shall not require Sellers to permit
any access to, or to disclose (i) any information that, in the reasonable,
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) of the Company, is reasonably likely to result in any violation of
any Legal Requirement or any Contract to which the Company or any other Seller
is a party or cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that
a Seller would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such
information and such undermining of such privilege could, in the Company's
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel), adversely affect in any material respect a Seller's position in any
pending or, what the Company believes in good faith (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii)
if the Company or any other Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, any
information that is reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ that, in the case
of clause (i), the Parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow
disclosure of such information to the extent doing so (A) would not (in the
good faith belief of the Company (after consultation with counsel, which may
be in-house counsel)) be reasonably likely to result in the violation of any
such Legal Requirement or Contract or be reasonably likely to cause such
privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or (B) could
reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Company (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of Buyer could be provided access to such information.

  



  

(d)  The information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.1_
shall be used solely for the purpose of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such information shall be kept confidential by Buyer in
accordance with (and shall constitute "Information" under and as defined in),
and Buyer shall otherwise abide by and be subject to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreements.

  



  

(e)  BUYER SHALL DEFEND, RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS
EACH SELLER AND EACH OF ITS PARTY AFFILIATES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL
LIABILITIES THAT ANY BUYER PARTY MAY ASSERT AGAINST ANY SELLER OR ANY OF ITS
PARTY AFFILIATES, BASED UPON INJURY TO PERSON, INCLUDING DEATH, OR TO
PROPERTY, ARISING IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER FROM ANY INSPECTION BY ANY BUYER
PARTY OF THE ASSETS AND ACCESS BY ANY BUYER PARTY TO THE ASSETS PRIOR TO THE
CLOSING DATE, _WHETHER OR NOT BASED UPON STRICT LIABILITY OR CAUSED BY THE
SOLE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OF ANY SELLER OR
ANY OF ITS PARTY AFFILIATES, UNLESS SUCH INJURY WAS OCCASIONED SOLELY BY THE
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER OR ANY OF ITS PARTY
AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES_.

effecting, by consent decree or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries as may be required in order to avoid the entry, or to effect the
dissolution, of any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in

application filed in connection with any appeal from either of such Orders.

Sellers in the Bankruptcy Case in advance of its filing, in each case, if
reasonably practicable under the circumstances before the filing of such
papers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Sellers' inadvertent failure
to comply with this _Section 6.5_, nor Sellers' failure to comply with this 
_Section 6.5_ due to emergency circumstances, shall constitute a breach under
this Agreement _provided_ that upon discovery of the inadvertent failure or
termination of the emergency circumstances, Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to remedy the failure to comply with this _Section 6.5_.

  



  

6.6   _Updates and Amendments of Exhibits, Schedules and
Disclosure Schedules_.

  



  

(a)  Until the third (3rd) Business Day before Closing, Sellers
shall have the right to amend, modify and/or supplement _Exhibit A_, 
_Exhibit F_ and _Schedule 1.2(f)_, in each case, as applicable, in order to
reflect (i) any new or additional Contracts or Leases taken by Sellers or
(ii) the deletion of any Contracts or Leases from any such Exhibit or
Schedule.

  



  

(b)  Promptly upon discovery or occurrence, Sellers shall amend,
modify and/or supplement the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matters
discovered or occurring subsequent to the Execution Date and such amendments,
modifications and/or supplements shall be deemed to have been included in
Sellers' representations and warranties for all purposes.

  



  

6.7   _Bidding Procedures_. The bidding procedures to be employed
with respect to this Agreement shall be those reflected in the Bidding
Procedures Order. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that Sellers and their
Representatives and Affiliates are and may continue soliciting inquiries,
proposals or offers from third parties (the " _Potential Bidders_ ") for the
Assets in connection with any alternative transaction pursuant to the terms of
the Bidding Procedures Order.

  



  

6.8   _Commitment Letters_. Buyer has delivered to Sellers true
and complete, fully-executed copies of commitment letters including all
exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such letters in effect as of
such date of delivery or other evidence of funding (the " _Commitment
Letters_ "), pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof each of the parties thereto (other than Buyer), has severally agreed
and committed to provide to Buyer the funds and/or financing set forth
therein (" _Financing_ "). As of the Closing Date, the

  



    

 | 25| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

Commitment Letters shall have not been amended, restated or otherwise
modified or waived subsequent to the date of delivery to Sellers and the
respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters shall have not
been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect. There shall be
no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters.  There shall be
no other agreements, side letters or arrangements that would permit the
parties to the Commitment Letters to reduce the amount of the Financing or
that would otherwise affect the availability of the Financing. The Commitment
Letters provide Buyer with binding financial commitments that, when funded at
Closing, will provide it with sufficient funds to pay the Purchase Price and
to pay any other amounts required to be paid by it in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. On or
before the Closing Date, Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Commitment Letter. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of,
and receipt of proceeds from, any Financing is not a condition to Buyer's
obligations hereunder, including Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing.

  



  

Article 7 _ 
 Additional Agreements_

  



  

7.1   _Taxes_.

  



  

(a)  Any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other
fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by 50/50 by Seller and Buyer. Seller will,
at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable law, the
Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of
any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  



  

(b)  Sellers shall retain responsibility for all ad valorem,
property, excise, severance, production or similar Taxes based upon operation
or ownership of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons or the receipt of
proceeds therefrom (collectively, the " _Asset Taxes_ ") assessed with
respect to the Assets for (i) any period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) the portion of any Straddle Period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall have responsibility for, and shall bear and pay,
all Asset Taxes assessed with respect to the Assets for (i) any period
after the Closing Date and (ii) the portion of any Straddle Period after the
Closing Date. For purposes of allocation between the Parties of Asset Taxes
that are payable with respect to any tax periods beginning before and ending
after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Periods_ "), the portion of any such
taxes that are attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period that
ends on or prior to the Closing Date shall (1) in the case of such Asset
Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a
transactional basis such as severance or production taxes, be allocated based
on revenues from sales occurring on or before the Closing Date (which shall
be Sellers' responsibility) and from and after the Closing Date (which shall
be Buyer's responsibility); and (2) in the case of other Asset Taxes, be
allocated pro rata per day between the period on or prior to the Closing Date
(which shall be Sellers' responsibility) and the period after the Closing Date
(which shall be Buyer's responsibility). For purposes of clause (1)

  



    

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item
that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated _pro rata_ per day
between the period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and the period
beginning at the Closing Date. At the Closing, Asset Taxes with respect
to each Asset for the applicable Straddle Period shall be prorated in
accordance with the foregoing provisions based on the Asset Tax assessment
for such Asset for such Straddle Period, if available, or if otherwise, based
on the Asset Taxes paid with respect to such Asset during the preceding Tax
period. With respect to any not yet delinquent Asset Taxes relating to a Tax
year ending after the Closing Date, Buyer will assume responsibility for the
actual payment of all such Asset Taxes to the applicable
Governmental Authority. With respect to any Asset Taxes relating to a
Straddle Period or Pre-Closing Tax Period that are delinquent as of
the Closing Date, the amount of which is known and not subject to dispute,
Buyer shall pay the delinquent amount of such Asset Taxes directly to the
applicable Governmental Authority at the Closing.

  



  

(c)  Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, as
the case may be (the " _Reimbursing Party_ "), shall provide reimbursement
for any Tax paid by the other (the " _Paying Party_ ") all or a portion of
which is the responsibility of the Reimbursing Party in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 7.1_ or which represents an overpayment for Taxes by
the Paying Party. Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any such
Tax, the Paying Party shall give notice to the Reimbursing Party of the Tax
payable and the Paying Party's and Reimbursing Party's respective Liability
therefor, although failure to do so will not relieve the Reimbursing Party
from its Liability hereunder except to the extent the Reimbursing Party is
prejudiced thereby.

  



  

(d)  From and after the Closing, Buyer and Sellers agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Assets (including
access to books and records and Tax Returns and related working papers dated
before Closing) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns,
the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit
by any taxing authority, the prosecution or defense of any claims, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax, and the claiming by Buyer of any federal,
state or local business tax credits or incentives that Buyer may qualify for
in any of the jurisdictions in which any of the Assets are located; _provided_
that neither Buyer nor Sellers shall be required to disclose the contents of
its income Tax Returns to any Person. Any expenses incurred in
furnishing such information or assistance pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_
shall be borne by the Party requesting it.

  



  

7.2   _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price and any
liability or other amount properly included in the amount realized by Sellers
or cost basis to Buyer with respect to the sale and purchase of the Assets
(the " _Tax Purchase Price_ "), as determined for United States federal
income tax purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulations § 1.1060-1(c) shall be
allocated for such purposes as set forth on _Schedule 7.2_. The allocation to
each Asset is referred to herein as the " _Allocated Value_ " of such Asset.
Except as required otherwise pursuant to a final determination (within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or corresponding provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law), the parties shall make consistent use of
the allocation as agreed or determined pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ for all
Tax purposes and in all filings, declarations and reports with the IRS and
other taxing authorities in respect thereof, including the reports required to
be filed under Section 1060 of the Code. In any action related to the
determination of any Tax, neither Buyer nor Sellers shall contend or represent
that such allocation is not correct.

  



    

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

7.3   _Bulk Sales_. The Parties intend that pursuant to section
363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the transfer of the Assets shall be free and
clear of any Encumbrances arising out of bulk transfer Legal Requirements, and
the Parties shall take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to so
provide in the Sale Order. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby
waives compliance by the Parties with "bulk sales," "bulk transfers" or
similar Legal Requirements in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any Transaction Document.

  



  

7.4   _Payments Received_. Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer,
on the other hand, each agree that, after the Closing, each will hold and
will promptly transfer and deliver to the other, from time to time as and when
received by them, any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using their
best efforts not to convert such checks into cash) or other property that they
may receive on or after the Closing which properly belongs to the other
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and will account to the other for all
such receipts.

  



  

7.5   _Adequate Assurance and Performance_.

  



  

(a)  With respect to each Assigned Contract and Assigned Lease
and Interest, Buyer shall provide adequate assurance as required under the
Bankruptcy Code of the future performance by Buyer of each such Assigned
Contract or Assigned Lease and Interest. Buyer and Sellers agree that they
will promptly take all actions reasonably required to assist in obtaining a
Bankruptcy Court finding that there has been an adequate demonstration of
adequate assurance of future performance under the Assigned Contracts and
the Assigned Leases and Interests, such as furnishing timely requested and
factually accurate affidavits, non-confidential financial information and
other documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court and making
Buyer's and Sellers' employees and Representatives available to testify
before the Bankruptcy Court.

  



  

(b)  Buyer shall pay, perform or satisfy the Assumed Liabilities
from time to time and as such Assumed Liabilities become due and payable or
are required to be performed or satisfied in accordance with their respective
terms.

  



  

(c)  Without limiting the provisions of _Section 7.5(a)_,
Buyer acknowledges that Sellers have no duty to maintain any bonds, letters
of credit, guarantees, cash deposits and insurance to secure performance or
payment under any Assigned Contracts or Assigned Leases and Interests
(collectively, " _Seller Credit Obligations_ ") after the Closing, and Buyer
agrees to cooperate with Sellers in Sellers' efforts to secure the release of
any Seller Credit Obligations previously posted by Sellers, such cooperation
to include, if necessary, the provision by Buyer of a guaranty or letter of
credit to secure Buyer's payment and/or performance under any Assigned
Contracts or Assigned Leases and Interests after the Closing. On or before
the Closing, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of Buyer,
replacements for all Seller Credit Obligations. If any Seller Credit
Obligation remains outstanding as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify
each Seller and each of its Party Affiliates and hold them harmless against
any Losses that the Sellers and their Party Affiliates may incur under any
such Seller Credit Obligations from and after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.5(c)_ , (i)
Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer in attempting to transfer the Seller Credit
Obligations to Buyer, and (ii) any and all collateral securing the Seller
Credit Obligations shall

  



    

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

constitute Assets and transfer to Buyer at Closing, but only to the extent
Sellers no longer remain liable for such Seller Credit Obligations and/or
Buyer has assumed such Seller Credit Obligations or such collateral is
released from such Seller Credit Obligations (including, if applicable,
pursuant to the Sale Order or other Order of the Bankruptcy Code).

  



  

7.6   _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Sellers shall provide Buyer within a reasonable period of
time (and in any event, no later than June 1, 2016), a list of all employees
who are employed by Sellers (other than any such employees in respect of whom
a notice of termination of employment effective prior to the Closing Date has
been given by Sellers), including, with respect to inactive employees, the
anticipated date of return to active employment. In its sole and absolute
discretion, Buyer may, but shall have no obligation to, offer employment to
all or fewer than all of Sellers' Employees. No later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall notify all of their employees
of the termination of their employment by Sellers, effective as of but
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing, other than such employees, if
any, who mutually agree with Sellers to continue their employment
following the Closing. At Closing, Sellers shall terminate the employment of
their employees that are Transferred Employees. Those employees who accept
Buyer's offer of employment made pursuant to this _Section 7.6(a)_ and
commence working for Buyer on the Closing Date are referred to herein as
"Transferred Employees." Buyer's decisions to offer or not offer employment
to Sellers' employees shall be in in Buyer's sole discretion but in
accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements, and Sellers shall have no
liability with respect to Buyer's offers of employment, employment decisions,
and employment and termination of employment of a Transferred Employee.

  



  

(b)  As and when due under applicable Legal Requirements,
Sellers shall pay to all Employees all (i) accrued and unpaid wages,
salaries, and commissions as of the Closing Date, (ii) accrued and unpaid or
unused vacation, and sick leave pay, and (iii) all other amounts to which
such Employees are due under applicable Legal Requirements.

  



  

(c)  Buyer and Sellers intend to use the "standard procedure"
under Revenue Procedure 2004-34, whereby each of the Buyer and the Sellers
report on Forms W-2 only those wages paid to the Transferred Employees for the
portion of the calendar year 2016 that such Transferred Employees were
employed by the Buyer and Seller respectively.

  



  

(d)  Sellers shall have full responsibility for all WARN Act
liabilities relating to the periods prior to or on the Closing
Date, including without limitation the termination of Employees to occur
immediately prior to the Closing and all prior terminations.

  



  

7.7   _Post-Closing Books and Records and Personnel_. For five
(5) years after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required by
any Governmental Authority or ongoing claim), (a) Buyer shall not dispose of
or destroy any of the Records received by Buyer as Assets and (b) Buyer shall
allow Sellers (including, for clarity, any trust established under a
chapter 11 plan of Sellers or any other successors of Sellers) and any of
their Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, at
Sellers' sole expense and upon reasonable advance notice, to all employees and
files of Buyer and its respective Subsidiaries and any Records included in
the Assets for purposes relating to the Bankruptcy Case, the wind-down of

  



    

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

the operations of Sellers and their estates, the functions of any such trusts
or successors, or other reasonable business purposes, and Sellers (including
any such trust or successors) and such Representatives shall have the right
to make copies of any such files, books, records, Records and other
materials. Until the closing of the Bankruptcy Case or the liquidation and
winding up of Sellers' estates, Sellers shall preserve and keep the Records
and, at Buyer's sole expense, shall make such Records, records, and Sellers'
personnel available to Buyer as may be reasonably required by Buyer in
connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by, Proceedings,
Actions or Tax audits against, or governmental investigations of, Buyer or
any of its Affiliates or in order to enable Buyer to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement and each other Transaction Document. In the
event any Party desires to destroy any such Records during or after the time
during which they must be maintained pursuant to this _Section 7.7_, such
Party shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other
Party and such other Party shall have the right at their option and expense,
upon prior written notice given within such ninety (90) day period to the
Party desiring to destroy such Records or records, to take possession of such
Records or records within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of
such notice, or such shorter period as the liquidation and winding up of
Sellers' estates shall permit.

  



  

7.8   _No Other Representations or Warranties or Reliance;
Disclaimers; NORM_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, except as and to the extent expressly set forth in  _Article 4_
(taking into account the Disclosure Schedules and the Company SEC Documents),
Sellers do not make, and Buyer is not relying on, any representations or
warranties whatsoever, and Sellers disclaim all liability and responsibility
for, and Buyer is not relying on, any representation, warranty, statement or
information made or communicated (orally or in writing) to Buyer (including
any opinion, information, or advice that may have been provided to Buyer by
any respective Affiliate or Representative of any Seller or by any investment
bank or investment banking firm, any petroleum engineer or engineering firm,
Sellers' counsel, or any other agent, consultant, or Representative of any
Seller). Sellers further do not make, and Buyer is not relying on, any
representation, covenant or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy
or completeness of any files, records or data heretofore or hereafter
furnished in connection with the Assets, or as to the quality or quantity of
hydrocarbon reserves (if any) attributable to the Assets, or the ability of
the Assets to produce hydrocarbons. Any and all such files, records and data
furnished by Sellers are provided as a convenience, and any reliance on or
use of the same shall be at Buyer's sole risk. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as and to the extent expressly set forth
in _Sections 4.19_ and _4.20_  of this Agreement, Sellers expressly
disclaim and negate, and Buyer is not relying on, any representation or
warranty, express, implied, at common law, by statute, or otherwise, relating
to (a) the title to any of the Assets, (b) the condition of the
Assets (including any implied or express warranty of merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose, or conformity to models or samples of materials),
it being distinctly understood that the Assets are being sold "As Is," "Where
Is," and "With All Faults As To All Matters," (c) any infringement by any
Seller of any patent or proprietary right of any third party, (d) any
information, data, or other materials (written or oral) furnished to Buyer by
or on behalf of Sellers (including without limitation, in

  



    

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

respect of any seismic data, the existence or extent of Hydrocarbons or the
mineral reserves, the recoverability of such reserves, any product pricing
assumptions, and the ability to sell Hydrocarbon production after the
Closing), and (e) the environmental condition and other condition of the
Assets and any potential liability (including any environmental liability)
arising from or related to the Assets.

  



  

(b)  Buyer acknowledges and affirms that it has made its own
independent investigation, analysis, and evaluation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the Assets (including Buyer's own
estimate and appraisal of the extent and value of Sellers' Hydrocarbon
reserves attributable to the Assets and an independent assessment and
appraisal of the environmental risks associated with the acquisition of the
Assets). Buyer acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement, it has
relied only on the aforementioned investigation and the express
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in _Article 4_ (taking
into account the Disclosure Schedules and the Company SEC Documents). Buyer
hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly,
asserting any claim, or commencing, instituting, or causing to be commenced,
any Proceeding of any kind against Sellers or their Affiliates or
Subsidiaries, alleging facts contrary to the agreements, acknowledgments and
affirmations set forth in this  _Section 7.8_.

  



  

(c)  Buyer acknowledges that the Assets have been used for
exploration, development and production of oil, gas and water and that there
may be petroleum, produced water, wastes or other Hazardous Substances located
on, under or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the
Assets may contain NORM. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of
wells, materials and equipment as scale, or in other forms; the wells,
materials and equipment located on or included in the Assets may contain NORM
and other wastes or Hazardous Substances; and NORM containing material and
other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have been buried, come in contact
with the soil or otherwise been disposed of on or around the Assets. Special
procedures may be required for the remediation, removal, transportation or
disposal of wastes, asbestos, Hazardous Substances, including hydrogen
sulfide gas and NORM from the Assets. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
assume responsibility for the control, storage, handling, transporting and
disposing of or discharge of all materials, substances and wastes from the
Assets (including produced water, hydrogen sulfide gas, drilling fluids, NORM
and other wastes), present at or after the Closing Date, in a safe and prudent
manner and in accordance with all applicable Environmental Laws.

  



  

(d)  Except as set forth in _Section 10.1(b)(i)_ with respect
to breaches of  _Section 4.20_, Buyer hereby expressly waives any and all
rights or remedies with respect to any defect in title or any other title
matter, with respect to the Assets (subject to Buyer's right to receive the
Assets free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances)
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Sale Order, all as
contemplated by _Section 1.1_).

  



  

7.9   _Casualty_.

  



    

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(a)  If, after the Execution Date and prior to the Closing, a
material part of the Assets suffers a Casualty Loss or if a material part of
the Assets is taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain or if
proceedings for such purposes are pending or threatened, Sellers shall
promptly give Buyer written notice of such occurrence, including reasonable
particulars with respect thereto, and this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect notwithstanding any such Casualty Loss.

  



  

(b)  With regard to a Casualty Loss or condemnation occurring
after the date of execution of this Agreement, without Buyer's prior consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no
insurance or condemnation proceeds shall be committed or applied by Sellers
to repair, restore or replace a lost, damaged, destroyed or taken portion of
the Assets if the cost to repair, restore or replace a lost, damaged,
destroyed or taken portion of the Assets is projected to exceed One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). To the extent such proceeds are not
committed or applied by Sellers prior to the Closing Date in accordance with
this _Section 7.9(b)_, Sellers shall at the Closing pay to Buyer all sums
paid to Sellers by reason of such loss, damage, destruction or taking, less
any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller in collecting such
proceeds. In addition and to the extent such proceeds have not been committed
or applied by Sellers in accordance with this _Section 7.9(b)_, in such
repair, restoration or replacement, Sellers shall transfer to Buyer, at the
Closing, without recourse against Sellers, all of the right, title and
interest of Sellers in and to any unpaid insurance or condemnation proceeds
arising out of such loss, damage, destruction or taking, less any reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by Sellers in collecting such proceeds. Any
such funds that have been committed by Sellers for repair, restoration or
replacement as aforesaid shall be paid by Sellers for such purposes or, at
Sellers' option, delivered to Buyer upon Sellers' receipt from Buyer of
adequate assurance and indemnity that Sellers shall incur no liability or
expense as a result of such commitment.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) at the Closing, the Assets affected by a Casualty Loss
or condemnation shall be included in the Closing and Buyer shall pay the full
Purchase Price, subject to any applicable adjustments under this Agreement,
and (ii) Buyer's recourse with respect to a condemnation or Casualty Loss
shall be limited to the proceeds of Sellers' applicable insurance coverage
actually recovered by Sellers in respect thereof or other sums paid to
Sellers by third parties (or an assignment of claims related thereto), which
proceeds or other sums shall be payable to Buyer only upon or after the
Closing of the transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers shall have no other
liability or responsibility to Buyer with respect to a condemnation or
Casualty Loss, even if such Casualty Loss shall have resulted from or shall
have arisen out of the sole or concurrent negligence, fault, violation of a
Legal Requirement, or willful misconduct of Seller or any Seller or any of
its Party Affiliates.

  



  

7.10   _Successor Operator_. Sellers shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to support Buyer's efforts to be appointed or to have a
designee appointed as the successor operator of those Properties that any
Seller currently operates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers makes no
representations or warranties to Buyer as to the transferability of
operatorship of any Properties which any Seller currently operates. Rights
and obligations associated with operatorship of the Properties are governed by
operating agreements or similar agreements and will be determined in
accordance with the terms of such agreements.

  



    

 | 32| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

7.11   _Preferential Purchase Rights_.

  



  

(a)  Promptly after the Sale Order is entered, Sellers shall
deliver to each holder of a Preferential Purchase Right a notice that is in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable thereto,
offering to sell to each such holder the applicable Assets subject to such
Preferential Purchase Right in exchange for an amount not less than the
Allocated Value of such Asset, or, alternatively, seeking such holder's
consent to the assignment of the applicable Assets to Buyer; it being
understood and agreed by the Parties that Sellers shall not be obligated to
make any payments or undertake obligations in connection with the obtaining
of such consents.

  



  

(b)  All Assets that are subject to Preferential Purchase Rights
shall be transferred or assigned to Buyer at the Closing, and Buyer shall
take title to such Assets subject to such Preferential Purchase Rights. In the
event any holder of a valid Preferential Purchase Right thereafter lawfully
and timely exercises its Preferential Purchase Right, Buyer shall assign such
affected Assets to the holder of such Preferential Purchase Right, and such
holder shall pay Buyer all proceeds generated from the exercise of such
Preferential Purchase Right.

  



  

(c)  If a Preferential Purchase Right is not discovered prior
to Closing, the affected Asset(s) is conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and such
Preferential Purchase Right is validly exercised by the holder thereof after
Closing, then Buyer (i) agrees to convey such affected Asset(s) to the person
exercising such Preferential Purchase Right on the same terms and conditions
under which Sellers conveyed such Asset(s) to Buyer (with the purchase price
for such Asset(s) being the Allocated Value of the affected Asset(s)) and
(ii) shall be entitled to retain all amounts paid by the person exercising
such Preferential Purchase Right. In the event of such exercise, Buyer shall
prepare, execute and deliver a form of conveyance of such.

  



  

7.12   _Accounting Adjustments for Revenues and Expenses_.

  



  

(a)  Conditioned upon the Closing occurring, the Base Purchase
Price shall be increased by (without duplication): (i) an amount equal to the
value of all merchantable allowable oil or other liquid Hydrocarbons in
storage owned by Sellers downstream of the first measuring point at the
Effective Time that is credited to the Assets and for which Sellers have not
yet been paid, such value to be the current market price or the price paid,
less Taxes and gravity adjustments deducted by the purchaser of such oil or
other liquid Hydrocarbons; (ii) an amount equal to the aggregate amount of
all expenditures paid in connection with the ownership,
development, production, operation and maintenance of the Properties
(including rentals, overhead, royalties, Lease option and extension
payments, Taxes and other charges and expenses billed under applicable
operating agreements or governmental statute(s)) which are paid by or on
behalf of Sellers, are not subject to reimbursement to Sellers pursuant to a
joint interest billing and are attributable to the period on or after the
Effective Time (including any pre-paid charges); (iii) all royalty overpayment
amounts and/or future deductions as royalty offsets associated with the
Assets as of the Effective Time; (iv) an amount equal to One Hundred
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) per month (or prorated portion
thereof) for the period from the Effective Time to the Closing Date,
representing overhead charges of Sellers with respect to Sellers' operated
Properties; and (v) any other amount provided elsewhere in this Agreement or
agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Sellers.

  



    

 | 33| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)  The Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by (without
duplication): (i) the amount of any proceeds received by Sellers from the
sale of Hydrocarbons, produced from and after the Effective Time, from the
Properties (net of royalties and other burdens on Buyer's share of the
proceeds from the production of Hydrocarbons not otherwise accounted for
hereunder) actually received by Sellers; (ii) the amount of the Suspense
Funds; (iii) the proceeds received by Sellers pre-Closing from the exercise of
any Preferential Purchase Rights; and (iv) any other amount agreed upon in
writing by Buyer and Sellers.

  



  

(c)  The Base Purchase Price will be adjusted upward or
downward, as applicable, by all Imbalances in existence at or arising after
the Effective Time, including (i) the net mcf and barrel of oil amount of the
aggregate Imbalances attributable to Sellers' Net Revenue Interest in the
Wells as of the Effective Time multiplied by a price per mcf of gas for such
Well and a price per barrel of oil for such Well, in each case, equal to the
applicable NYMEX contract price as of the close of trading on the last
Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time (upward for underage
and downward for overage); and (ii) the MMBtu amount of any
pipeline Imbalances or unsatisfied throughput obligations attributable to
Sellers or the Assets for Sellers' ownership prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the actual settlement price per MMBtu (upward for over
deliveries and downward for under deliveries).

  



  

7.13   _Initial Adjustment at Closing_. At least five (5) Business
Days before the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide to Buyer a statement
showing their computations, calculated in good faith, of the amount of the
adjustments provided for in _Section 7.12_ above. Buyer and Sellers shall
attempt to agree upon such adjustments prior to Closing; _provided_ that if
agreement is not reached, Buyer's computation shall be used at Closing,
subject to further adjustment under _Section 7.14_ below. If the amount of
adjustments so determined which would result in a credit to Buyer exceeding
the amount of adjustments so determined which would result in a credit to
Sellers, Buyer shall receive a Base Purchase Price reduction at Closing for
the amount of such excess, and if the converse is true, then the amount to be
paid by Buyer to Sellers at Closing shall be increased by the amount of such
excess.

  



  

7.14   _Adjustment Post Closing_. On or before ninety (90) days after
Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall review any information which may then be
available pertaining to the adjustments provided for in _Section 2.1_, shall
determine if any additional adjustments should be made beyond those made at
Closing (whether the same be made to account for expenses or revenues not
considered in making the adjustments made at Closing, or to correct errors
made in the adjustments made at Closing), and shall make any such adjustments
by appropriate payments from Sellers to Buyer or from Buyer to Sellers. If the
Parties fail to agree on final adjustments within such ninety (90) day
period, either Party may, within thirty (30) days after the end of such
period, submit the disputed items to a nationally-recognized or regionally-
recognized, United States-based independent public accounting firm on which
the Parties mutually agree in writing (the " _Accounting Referee_ ");
_provided_  that the Accounting Referee shall not have performed any material
work for any Party or their respective Affiliates within three years of the
date hereof. If the selected Accounting Referee is unable or unwilling to
serve as the Accounting Referee and the Parties are unable to agree upon the
designation of a Person or entity as substitute (or if the Parties cannot
agree in the first place to an Accounting Referee, then Sellers or Buyer, or
either of them, may in writing request the Bankruptcy Court to appoint a
substitute Accounting Referee and such 30-day period will be extended with
until ten (10) Business Days after the Bankruptcy

Court so appoints; _provided_ that such Person or entity so appointed shall
be a national or regional accounting firm with no prior material relationships
with Sellers or Buyer or their respective Affiliates and shall have
experience in auditing companies engaged in oil and gas exploration
and development activities. Any unresolved matters described in this _Section
7.14_ that are not submitted to the Accounting Referee within such thirty
(30) day period shall be deemed waived by the Parties, which waiver shall be
final and binding on the Parties and the subject matter thereof shall not be
subject to further review or audit. The Parties shall direct the
Accounting Referee to resolve the disputes within thirty (30) days (or
extended, if applicable) after submission of the matters in dispute. The
Accounting Referee shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed matters submitted by either Party and may
not award damages or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.
Sellers and Buyer shall share equally the Accounting Referee's costs, fees
and expenses (including attorneys' fees). The final settlement statement,
whether as agreed between the Parties or as determined by a decision of the
Accounting Referee (the " _Final Settlement Statement_ "), shall be binding
on, and non-appealable by, the Parties and not subject to further review or
audit. Payment by Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, for any outstanding amounts
on the Final Settlement Statement shall be made within five (5) Business Days
after the date on which all disputes in respect of the Final Settlement
Statement are finally resolved (whether by agreement of the Parties or
pursuant to the Accounting Referee's decision). During the period between
Closing and the point in time when such post-closing adjustment has been
agreed to, resolved or waived pursuant to this _Section 7.14_, each Party
shall, on a monthly basis, pay over to the other Party any revenue received by
it (net of related expenses) with respect to the Assets which is owed to the
other Party as set forth in _Section 7.12_ above and such payments shall be
considered in making such post-closing adjustment. Should any additional
adjustments be required after such adjustments thereunder are concluded, such
adjustments shall be made by appropriate payments from Buyer to Sellers or
from Sellers to Buyer; _provided_ that in no event shall any adjustments be
made beyond twelve (12) months after the Closing Date.

  



  

7.15   _Delivery of Division Order Title Opinions_. Five (5) business
days before Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer copies that are in
Sellers' possession of the most recent Division Order Title Opinions for all
Leases.

  



  

7.16   _Governmental Transfer Documents_. At or prior to Closing,
Sellers shall deliver to Buyer the Governmental Transfer Documents as
reasonably requested by Buyer executed by the appropriate Sellers.

  



  

7.17   _Cooperation with Sellers_. From and after the Execution Date,
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Sellers in
pursuing the matters contemplated by _Section 8.6_ hereof.

connected to the DMS Contracts do not and shall not run with the land or
encumber the Hydrocarbon Leases; or (b) the Sale Order shall provide that
Buyer shall acquire the Assets free and clear of all of the DMS Contracts and

efforts to pursue satisfaction of both (a) and (b) above.

certificate or other Transaction Document delivered by Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement shall terminate upon and not survive the Closing and there
shall be no liability in respect thereof. Each of Sellers' covenants and other

such covenant or other agreement; _provided_  that if a written notice of any

or settlement.

  



  

11.2   _No Survival of Buyer 's Representations and Warranties_. The
representations and warranties of Buyer contained in _Article 5_ of this

 General Provisions_

  



  

12.1   _Fiduciary Duties_. Nothing in this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents will require any Seller or any of their
respective directors, officers or members, in each case, in their capacity as
such, to take any action, or to refrain from taking any action, to the extent
inconsistent with their fiduciary obligations.

continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the execution and delivery
by the Parties of this Agreement; _provided_ that (a) disclosure of matters
that become a matter of public record as a result of the Bankruptcy Case and
the filings related thereto shall not constitute a breach of such
Confidentiality Agreements, and (b) disclosures expressly permitted under
this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of such Confidentiality
Agreements.

  



  

12.3   _Public Announcements_. Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers,
on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this

any such statement without the prior written consent of the other Party (such
consent not to be

  



    

 | 41| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to or
after the Closing, if Buyer (including any of its parent entities), on the one
hand, or Sellers (including any of their parent entities), on the other is
required to make any statement, declaration or public announcement regarding
this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereunder (a) pursuant to any
Legal Requirement or applicable rules or regulations of any national
securities exchange or (b) as required by the Bankruptcy Court or Bankruptcy
Code, then the same may be made without the approval of the other Party, but,
in the case of disclosures made by Buyer, only to the extent the name of
Sellers are omitted from such statement, declaration or announcement if
permitted by the applicable Legal Requirements and, in each case,
allowing the other Party reasonable time to comment thereon.

signed by the Party against which enforcement of such waiver is sought.
