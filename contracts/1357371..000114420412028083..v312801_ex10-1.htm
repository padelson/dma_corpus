Section 3.04 _Notice of Title Defects._

  



   | (a)| If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting any Asset, Buyer
shall notify Seller as promptly as possible, but no later than the expiration
of the Examination Period of such alleged Title Defect. To be effective, such
notice must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by Seller by 5:00 p.m.
Central Standard Time on the expiration date of the Examination Period and
(iii) describe the Title Defect in reasonable detail, to the extent then
reasonably known by Buyer (including the estimated value of such Title Defect
as determined by Buyer). Any matters that may otherwise constitute Title
Defects, but of which Seller has not been notified by Buyer in accordance
with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all
purposes and shall constitute Permitted Encumbrances. 
---|---|--- 
  



   

7 
--- 

 


--- 

    



   | (b)| Upon the receipt of such effective notice from Buyer, Seller, at
Seller's option, shall (i) subject to _Section 3.05(a)_ , attempt to cure
such Title Defect at any time prior to the Closing or (ii) exclude the
affected Asset from the sale and reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated
Value of such affected Asset as set forth on _Exhibit C_. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The value attributable to each Title Defect (the " _Title Defect
Value_ ") that is asserted by Buyer in the Title Defect notices shall be
determined based upon the criteria set forth below: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| If the Title Defect is a lien upon any Asset, the Title Defect
Value is the amount reasonably expected to be necessary to be paid to remove
the lien from the affected Asset. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest
attributable to any Well or unit or Well location is less than that stated in
_Exhibit C_ or the Working Interest attributable to any Well or unit or Well
location is greater than that stated in _Exhibit C_, then the Title Defect
Value shall take into account the relative change in the interest from
Exhibit C and the appropriate Allocated Value attributed to such Asset. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance,
burden or charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in Working
Interest for which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue
Interest) for which the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the
amount of the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into
account the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential discounted economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the
affected Asset. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| If a Title Defect is not in effect or does not adversely affect
an Asset throughout the entire productive life of such Asset, such fact shall
be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Value. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| The Title Defect Value shall be determined without duplication of
any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value hereunder. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event
shall a Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the Wells, units or
other Assets affected thereby. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vii)| Such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper
evaluation. 
---|---|---

Section 3.05 _Remedies for Title Defects_.

  



   | (a)| With respect to each Title Defect that Seller does not cure on or
before the Closing, except as otherwise provided in this _Section 3.05_ , the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Title Defect
Value agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Seller or, if Buyer agrees, Seller
shall indemnify Buyer pursuant to _Section 14.04_ against all costs which
Buyer may incur in connection with such Title Defect. If any Title Defect is
in the nature of an unobtained consent to assignment or other restriction on
assignability, the provisions of _Section 3.08_ shall apply. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Except for those affected Assets which Seller elects to exclude
from this transaction pursuant to _Section 3.04(b)(ii)_ , if on or before
Closing the Parties have not agreed upon the validity of any asserted Title
Defect or have not agreed on the Title Defect Value attributable thereto,
either Party shall have the right to elect to have the validity of such Title
Defect and/or such Title Defect Value determined by an Independent Expert
pursuant to _Section 16.03_ ; _provided_  that if the validity of any
asserted Title Defect, or the Title Defect Value attributable thereto, is not
determined before Closing, the affected Asset shall be excluded from the sale
and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
affected Asset as set forth on _Exhibit C_. Upon resolution of such dispute,
the Allocated Value of that Asset less the Title Defect Value, if any, found
to be attributable to such Title Defect shall, subject to this _Section 3.05_
, be paid by Buyer to Seller and the Asset conveyed to Buyer, if that is part
of the mutually agreed settlement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i)
if the value of a given individual Title Defect (or individual Title Benefit
(as defined in _Section 3.09(a)_ ) does not exceed $50,000 then no adjustment
to the Purchase Price shall be made for such Title Defect (or Title Benefit),
(ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in
accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects and Environmental Defects (as
hereinafter defined) does not exceed three percent (3%) __ of the Purchase
Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then no adjustment of the Purchase
Price shall be made therefor and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the
Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects
and Environmental Defects does exceed three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price
prior to any adjustments thereto, then the Purchase Price shall only be
adjusted by the amount of such excess. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Section 3.06 _Seller 's Waiver of Tag-Along Rights_. Seller hereby
expressly and permanently (i) waives its right to "tag along" under Section 7
of that certain Participation Agreement dated as of April 1, 2009, by and
between Seller, CrownRock, L.P. and CrownQuest Operating, L.P. (the " _PA_ ")
with respect to the sale by CrownRock, L.P. of its interest in the Assets and
all other assets (as defined in the Crown PSA (as hereinafter defined), herein
the " _Crown Assets_ ") pursuant to that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement
between Buyer and CrownRock, L.P., dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Crown PSA_ "), (ii) from and after the Effective Time, agrees that the "tag
along" under Section 7 of the PA shall not apply to the sale of any or all of
the Assets or the Crown Assets by Buyer or any of its successors, transferees
or assigns and (iii) consents to the sale by CrownRock, L.P. of its interests
in the Assets and the Crown Assets, notwithstanding the "maintenance of
uniform interest" or similar provisions in any joint operating agreement to
which any of the Assets or the Crown Assets are subject.

Section 3.07 _Preferential Rights To Purchase_. _Schedule 3.07_
lists all agreements containing a preferential right to purchase (the "
_Preference Rights_ ").

  



  

Section 3.08 _Consents to Assignment_. Seller shall use all reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary consents set forth on  _Schedule 5.11_ from
Third Parties to assign the Assets prior to the Closing (other than
governmental approvals that are customarily obtained after the Closing) and
Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to assist Seller with such efforts. If
prior to the Closing, Seller fails to obtain a consent to assign that would
invalidate the conveyance of the Asset affected by the consent to assign to
Buyer or materially affect the value or use of the Asset, then Seller shall
retain the affected Asset and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the affected Asset. If such consent has been obtained as of
the Final Settlement Date, then Seller shall convey the affected Asset to
Buyer effective as of the Effective Time, subject to the same terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and Buyer shall pay Seller the
Allocated Value of the affected Asset, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. If such consent has not been obtained as of the
Final Settlement Date, the affected Asset shall be excluded from the sale and
the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of the affected Asset. For purposes of the foregoing, consent
requirements that do not expressly (i) render transfer of the
applicable Assets to Buyer void or voidable if such consent is not obtained
(ii) result in lease termination, or (iii) result in liquidated damages or
otherwise materially affect the value or the use of the Asset, shall not be
objectionable by Buyer and any such Assets shall be conveyed and paid for at
Closing without regard to whether or not consents thereto are obtained. Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining any required consent
including providing assurances of reasonable financial conditions, but Buyer
shall not be required to expend funds or make any other type of financial
commitments as a condition of obtaining such consent.

Section 3.09 _Remedies for Title Benefits_.

  



   | (a)| If either Party discovers any Title Benefit during the
Examination Period affecting the Assets, it shall promptly notify the other
Party in writing thereof on or before the expiration of the Examination
Period. Subject to _Section 3.05_ , Seller shall be entitled to an upward
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)(iv)_ with
respect to all Title Benefits in excess of $50,000 in an amount mutually
agreed upon by the Parties; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary (i) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase
Price for Title Benefits determined in accordance with this Agreement does
not exceed three percent (3%) of the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments
thereto, then no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made therefor and
(ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price for Title Benefits
determined in accordance with this Agreement does exceed three percent (3%) of
the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then the Purchase Price
shall only be adjusted by the amount of such excess. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " shall mean Seller's interest in any
Subject Interest that is greater than or in addition to that set forth in
_Exhibit B_ (including, without limitation, a Net Revenue Interest that is
greater than that set forth in _Exhibit B_) or Seller's Working Interest in
any Subject Interest that is less than the Working Interest set forth in
_Exhibit B_ (without a corresponding decrease in the Net Revenue Interest).
Any matters that may otherwise constitute Title Benefits, but of which Buyer
has not been specifically notified by Seller in accordance with the foregoing,
shall be deemed to have been waived by Seller for all purposes. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| If, with respect to a Title Benefit, the Parties are not deemed
to have agreed on the amount of the upward Purchase Price Adjustment or have
not otherwise agreed on such amount prior to the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer
shall have the right to elect to have such Purchase Price Adjustment
determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to _Section 16.03_. If the
amount of such adjustment is not determined pursuant to this Agreement by the
Closing, the undisputed portion of the Purchase Price with respect to the
Asset affected by such Title Benefit shall be paid by Buyer at the Closing
and, subject to _Section 3.05_ , upon determination of the amount of such
adjustment, any unpaid portion thereof shall be paid by Buyer to Seller.

_Buyer 's Environmental Consultant_") to conduct an environmental review of
the Assets and Seller's records pertaining to the Assets (as set forth in
_Section 3.01_ ) prior to the expiration of the Examination Period (" _Buyer
's Environmental Review_"). The cost and expense of Buyer's Environmental
Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer. The scope of work
comprising Buyer's Environmental Review shall not include any intrusive test
or procedure without the prior written consent of Seller. Buyer shall (and
shall cause Buyer's Environmental Consultant to): (i) consult with Seller
before conducting any work comprising Buyer's Environmental Review, (ii)
perform all such work in a safe and workmanlike manner and so as to not
unreasonably interfere with Seller's operations and (iii) comply with all
applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for obtaining any Third Party consents that are required in order
to perform any work comprising Buyer's Environmental Review, and Buyer shall
consult with Seller prior to requesting each such Third Party consent;
_provided_ that Seller shall reasonably assist Buyer (or Buyer's
Environmental Consultant) in obtaining any Third Party consents. Seller shall
have the right to have a representative or representatives accompany Buyer
and Buyer's Environmental Consultant at all times during
Buyer's Environmental Review. With respect to any samples taken in connection
with Buyer's Environmental Review, Buyer shall take split samples, providing
one of each such sample, properly labeled and identified, to Seller. The
Parties shall execute a "common undertaking" letter regarding the
confidentiality for the Environmental Review where appropriate. Buyer hereby
agrees to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and
against all claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses, causes of action and
judgments of any kind or character (including those resulting from Seller's
sole, joint, COMPARATIVE or concurrent negligence or strict liability) to the
extent arising out of Buyer's Environmental Review. Buyer hereby covenants
and agrees that it will have at least $2,000,000 of general liability
insurance to cover its indemnification hereunder prior to the commencement of

   | (b)| Unless otherwise required by applicable law, Buyer shall (and
shall cause Buyer's Environmental Consultant to) treat confidentially any
matters revealed by Buyer's Environmental Review and any reports or data
generated from such review (the " _Environmental Information_ "), and Buyer
shall not (and shall cause Buyer's Environmental Consultant to not) disclose
any Environmental Information to any Governmental Authority or other Third
Party without the prior written consent of Seller unless otherwise required
by law. Unless otherwise required by law, prior to the Closing, Buyer may
use the Environmental Information only in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If Buyer, Buyer's Environmental Consultant,
or any Third Party to whom Buyer has provided any Environmental Information
become legally compelled to disclose any of the Environmental Information,
Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, provide Seller with good
faith notice prior to any such disclosure so as to allow Seller to attempt to
file any protective order, or seek any other remedy, as it deems appropriate
under the circumstances. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall deliver the Environmental Information to Seller, which
Environmental Information shall become the sole property of Seller. Buyer
shall provide two (2) copies of the Environmental Information to Seller
without charge. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Buyer acknowledges that the Assets have been used for
exploration, development, and production of oil and gas and that there may be
petroleum, produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located
in, on or under or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included
in the Assets may contain asbestos, hazardous substances, or
naturally occurring radioactive material (" _NORM_ "). NORM may affix or
attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or
in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment located on the Assets may
contain NORM and other wastes or hazardous substances. NORM containing
material and/or other wastes or hazardous substances may have come in contact
with various environmental media, including without limitation, water, soils
or sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment,
remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of environmental media,
wastes, asbestos, hazardous substances and NORM from the Assets.

expected to constitute a violation of such Environmental Laws or
environmental permits if investigated by a Governmental Authority (as

investigated by a Governmental Authority or (iii) would require remediation
under such Environmental Laws (other than any plugging and abandonment and
associated surface restoration obligations under any applicable Environmental

the term " _Environmental Defect Value_ " shall mean, with respect to any
Environmental Defect, the value, as of the Closing Date, of the
estimated costs and expenses to correct such Environmental Defect in the most
cost-effective manner reasonably available, consistent with Environmental
Laws, taking into account that non-permanent remedies (such as mechanisms to
contain or stabilize hazardous materials, including monitoring site
conditions, natural attenuation, risk-based corrective action, institutional
controls or other appropriate restrictions on the use of property, caps,
dikes, encapsulation, leachate collection systems, etc.) may be the most cost-
effective manner reasonably available. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Section 4.03 _Notice of Environmental Defects_.

  



   | (a)| If Buyer discovers any Environmental Defect affecting the Assets,
Buyer shall notify Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination Period
of such alleged Environmental Defect. To be effective, such notice must: (i)

may otherwise constitute Environmental Defects, but of which Seller has not
been notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, together with any
environmental matter that does not constitute an Environmental Defect, shall
be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and constitute an
Assumed Obligation (as defined in _Section 14.02_ ). Upon the receipt of such
effective notice from Buyer, Seller, at Seller's option, shall (i) cure such
Environmental Defect at any time prior to the Closing or (ii) exclude the
affected Asset from the sale and reduce the Purchase Price by the
Allocated Value of such affected Asset as set forth on _Exhibit C_, or (iii)

accordance with _Section 4.03_  is not cured on or before the Closing, and
Seller has not elected to exclude the affected Assets from this sale or Buyer
and Seller have not agreed for Seller to indemnify Buyer for the

asserted Environmental Defect, or if the Parties have not agreed on the
Environmental Defect Value therefor, and if Seller shall not have elected to
exclude the affected Assets from this sale pursuant to _Section 4.03(b)(ii)_
, then either Party shall have the right to elect to have the validity of the
asserted Environmental Defect, and/or the Environmental Defect Value for such

excluded from the Closing and the Purchase Price paid at the Closing shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of that Asset. Upon resolution of such
dispute, the Allocated Value of that Asset less the Environmental Defect
Value, if any, found to be attributable to such Environmental Defect shall,
subject to this _Section 4.04_ , be paid by Buyer to Seller and the Asset
conveyed to Buyer, if that is part of the mutually agreed settlement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Buyer or Seller shall have the right
to exclude an Asset from the sale if the Environmental Defect Value exceeds
the Allocated Value of the Asset(s) affected thereby.

 Tax Matters

  



  

Section 9.01 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Seller expect that this
transaction will not be subject to any sales, use, transfer or similar Taxes
(" _Transfer Taxes_ ") because the transaction is a transfer of realty and the
transfer of tangible personal property, if any, is incidental to the transfer
of realty. Accordingly, no Transfer Taxes will be collected at Closing from
Buyer in connection with this transaction. Seller and Buyer agree to
cooperate with each other in attempting to demonstrate that the requirements
for any exemption from such Taxes have been met. To the extent any Transfer
Taxes or recording fees are nevertheless incurred by or imposed with respect
to the transfer of the Assets to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, such
Transfer Taxes or recording fees shall be solely the responsibility of Buyer.
Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to
the extent permissible under applicable law, the amount of any such Transfer
Taxes and recording fees. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall retain all
liability for and shall pay all income Tax, franchise Tax and similar Taxes
imposed on any income or gain realized by Seller pursuant to the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement.

Section 9.02 _Asset Taxes_. Seller shall retain responsibility for and
bear all Asset Taxes for (A) any period ending prior to the Effective Time
and (B) the portion of any Straddle Period that ends immediately prior to the
Effective Time. All Asset Taxes with respect to the ownership or operation of
the Assets arising on or after the Effective Time shall be allocated to and
borne by Buyer. For purposes of allocation between Seller and Buyer of Asset
Taxes that are payable with respect to Straddle Periods, the portion of any
such Taxes that are attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period that
ends immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (i) in the case of Asset
Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a
transactional basis such as severance or production Taxes, be deemed equal to
the amount that would be payable if the tax year or period ended immediately
prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) in the case of other Asset Taxes, be
deemed equal to the product of (1) the amount of such Asset Taxes multiplied
by (2) the quotient of the number of days in the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective
Time occurs, divided by the total number of days in such Straddle Period. To
the extent the actual amount of Asset Taxes is not determinable at Closing or
at the time the Final Statement is prepared, as applicable, Buyer and Seller
shall utilize the most recent information available in estimating the amount
of Asset Taxes for purposes of _Sections 10.02(a)(ii)_ , _10.02(b)(iii)_ ,
and _12.02_. If, at the time the actual amount of an Asset Tax is determined,
the amount of such Asset Tax paid by Seller, plus, if applicable, the amount
of any adjustment to the Purchase Price with respect to such Asset Tax made
pursuant to _Section 10.02(b)(iii)_ and _Section 12.02_ _minus_ , if
applicable, the amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price with respect
to such Asset Tax made pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)(ii)_  and _Section
12.02_ is (x) less than Seller's share of the actual amount of such Asset Tax
determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 9.02_ , then
Seller shall promptly pay Buyer an amount equal to such difference or
(y) more than Seller's share of the actual amount of such Asset Tax,
determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 9.02_ ,
then Buyer shall promptly pay Seller an amount equal to such difference.

  



  

Section 9.03 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate in the preparation of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 pursuant
to Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, to report the allocation of the
Purchase Price, the Assumed Obligations and any other items constituting
consideration for applicable income Tax purposes (to the extent known at such
time) among the Assets and in a manner that is, to the maximum extent
possible, consistent with the allocation set forth in _Exhibit C_ (the "
_Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Buyer and Seller agree to amend the Purchase
Price Allocation to reflect adjustments to the Purchase Price and to report
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement consistently with the
Purchase Price Allocation, as adjusted by the Parties, on any Tax Return, and
will not assert, and will cause their affiliates not to assert, in connection
with any Tax audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, any asset
values or other items inconsistent with the amounts set forth in the Purchase
Price Allocation except with the agreement of the other Parties or as
required by applicable law.

Section 9.04 _Tax Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another Party's request) the provision of records
and information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation
or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided under this Agreement. Seller and the Buyer agree to retain all books
and records with respect to tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to
any tax period beginning before the Effective Time until the expiration of
the statute of limitations of the respective tax periods and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority.

  



  

Section 9.05 _754 Elections_. Seller shall, prior to the Closing, (i)
cause each Asset that is classified as (or treated as being held by) a
partnership (other than Seller) for federal income tax purposes to either (x)
have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code for
any taxable year that includes the Closing Date or (y) obtain all necessary
consents therefor; and (ii) provide evidence satisfactory to Buyer thereof.
