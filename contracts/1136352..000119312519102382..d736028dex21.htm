Sellers Knowledge, neither the Company nor the business as currently or
previously conducted has, during the two (2) years prior to the date hereof,
infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated the Intellectual
Property Rights of any Person in any material respect. To Sellers Knowledge,

Section 6.02. _Use of_ _Seller Marks_ _._ Seller is not conveying
ownership rights or granting Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer (including after
the Closing, the Company) a license or other right to use any of the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, logos or domain names owned by Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company) (including the trade names
"Williams," "Williams Partners," "Williams Hub," "Williams Energy," "Williams
Energy Companies," "We Make Energy Happen!" or any trade name, trademark,
service mark, logo or domain name incorporating the trade names "Williams,"
"Williams Partners," "Williams Hub," "Williams Energy," "Williams
Energy Companies," or "We Make Energy Happen!") (collectively, the "Seller
Marks") and, after the Closing, except as expressly permitted in this Section
6.02, Buyer shall not permit the Company or any Affiliate of the Company to
use the Seller Marks or any name or mark that is a variation thereof or
confusingly similar thereto. As promptly as practicable, and in any event no
later than sixty (60) days after the Closing, except as expressly permitted in
this Section 6.02, Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates, including,
after the Closing, the Company, to) take all necessary action to cease any and
all use of the Seller Marks, including in marketing, promoting, advertising or
offering for sale any products, goods or services. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 6.02, after the Closing, Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) may use the Seller
Marks solely (i) on internal office supplies or signage not visible to
consumers or the general public, provided that such supplies or signage are
replaced promptly in the ordinary course of business, (ii) in a neutral, non-
trademark manner to describe the historical relationship of Buyer, Seller and
Company in an accurate and factual manner (it being understood that any such
use shall include reasonable notices or legends indicating that Seller and its
Affiliates are no longer affiliated with the Company), or (iii) to the extent
required by Applicable Law in legal or business documents already in existence
on the Closing Date. From and after the Closing, neither Buyer nor any
Affiliate of Buyer (including, after the Closing, the Company) shall
challenge the validity, enforceability or ownership of any of the Seller Marks
expressly set forth above or that, immediately prior to the Closing Date, were
Seller Marks used by the Company in the ordinary course of business. In the
event of any actual or threatened violation of this Section 6.02, Seller shall
be entitled to, in addition to other remedies that it may have, a temporary
restraining order and other injunctive relief against Buyer or any applicable
Affiliate of Buyer (including, after the Closing, the Company) to prevent or
cease any violations of this Section 6.02.

 

Section 6.03. _Confidentiality; Public Announcements_.

 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate, effective as of the Closing Date. Seller agrees that, for a
period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, treat and hold as confidential (i) all
information concerning the businesses and affairs of the Company as of the
Closing Date and (ii) the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements (including financial terms) (collectively, the "Confidential
Information"). In the event that Seller or any of its Affiliates is requested
or required by law, rule, regulation, stock exchange rule, or legal process to
disclose any Confidential Information, it shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law and reasonably practicable, notify Buyer promptly of the
request or requirement so that Buyer, at its

 



27

    

 expense, may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with
the provisions of this Section 6.03. If such protective order or other remedy
is not obtained, nor is a waiver hereunder provided, and Seller or any of its
Affiliates is required to disclose any Confidential Information under
Applicable Law, it may disclose the portions of the Confidential Information
required to be disclosed (and only such portions);  _provided_ that it shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and expense
of Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement,
Confidential Information shall not include (A) information that enters the
public domain (or becomes generally known within the industry), other than as
a result of a disclosure by Seller or any of its Affiliates in violation of
this Section 6.03, (B) information acquired by Seller or any of its Affiliates
from sources other than those related to its prior ownership of the Purchased
Units or (C) information used by Sellers Subsidiaries (other than the
Company) prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) Neither party may issue any press release or make any other public
announcement relating to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the financial
terms hereof) without first consulting the other party regarding such press
release or other public announcement and considering the other partys
comments in good faith (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, any
regulatory or supervisory body or the rules of any securities exchange to
which the disclosing party is subject).

 

Section 6.04. _Directors and Officers_. Buyer acknowledges that (a) each
Person that prior to the Closing served as a director, officer, manager,
employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of the Company or who, at the request of
the Company, served as a director, officer, manager, member, employee, agent,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively,
with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, the "Indemnified
Persons") is entitled to indemnification, expense reimbursement and
exculpation to the extent provided in the Governing Documents of the Company
in effect as of the date hereof ("DandO Provisions") and (b) no amendment or
modification (including by merger, consolidation or operation of law) to any
such DandO Provisions shall affect in any manner the Indemnified Persons
rights, or the Companys obligations, with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing.

 

Section 6.05. _Employee and Related Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer has made, or has caused an Affiliate
of Buyer ("Employer") to make, a Qualifying Offer of employment to each of
the Business Employees. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Qualifying Offer"
shall (i) be a written offer of employment substantially consistent with the
terms of this Section 6.05 to a Business Employee for employment with
Employer, (ii) be on terms or conditions comparable to similarly situated
employees of Employer (with credit for years of service solely for purposes of
vacation, paid time, sick leave, disability and severance entitlement and
vesting and eligibility under any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section
3(3) of

 



28

    

 ERISA) maintained by Employer or its Affiliate for similarly situated
employees of Employer), (iii) offer employment at a principal work place no
more than fifty (50) miles from such Business Employees principal work place
as of the date of the Qualifying Offer, (iv) provide the same or more
favorable annualized base salary as such Business Employee received as of the
date of the Qualifying Offer, (v) provide that such employment will be
effective (contingent upon the Business Employees timely acceptance of the
Qualifying Offer in accordance with its terms and conditions, which Qualifying
Offer shall provide that the Business Employee has until 2:00 p.m. Central
Standard Time on April 1, 2019 for the Business Employee to accept) as of the
Closing Date except as provided below, and (vi) otherwise be subject to the
applicable employee screening and testing policies and procedures of Buyer or
Employer and not inconsistent in any material respect with Buyers or
Employers standard terms, conditions and policies of employment. A Business
Employee who signifies his or her acceptance of a Qualifying Offer, but does
not report for work as specified in the Qualifying Offer and does not
otherwise satisfy each of the terms and conditions of such Qualifying Offer,
shall be deemed not to have accepted the Qualifying Offer. A Business Employee
who accepts and complies with the terms and conditions of a Qualifying Offer
and assumes employment with Employer shall become an employee of Employer (a
"Transferred Employee") as of the following date and time: (i) in the case of
a Business Employee who is not on a leave of absence on the Closing Date,
12:00 a.m. of the day after the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of a
Business Employee who is on any approved leave absence on the Closing Date, as
of the date such Business Employee commences active employment with Employer
(provided that such commencement of active employment occurs no later than 90
days following the Closing Date or such later time as may be required by
Applicable Law). Without limiting Buyers obligation under the first sentence
of this Section 6.05(a), if Employer does not make a Qualifying Offer to a
Business Employee, Employer shall pay such Business Employee one (1) year of
base salary as severance therefor.

 

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Employer
shall not, and shall cause Buyer, Company and any of their respective
Affiliates, as applicable, not to (i) relocate any Transferred Employee who
remains employed by Employer to a distance more than fifty (50) miles from
such Transferred Employees principal work place as of the date of the
Qualifying Offer, unless the Transferred Employee shall agree otherwise, or
(ii) terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee, other than for
cause in accordance with Employer employment practices;  _provided, however,_
that in the event any such Transferred Employee either: (A) terminates his or
her employment with Employer instead of accepting such relocation, or (B) has
his or her employment terminated by Employer other than for cause (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, not due to death, disability, or his or her
resignation from employment), then Employer shall make available to such
Transferred Employee (and, if such Transferred Employee satisfies the Release
Condition (if any), pay to such Transferred Employee within sixty (60) days
following his or her termination of employment) the Severance Payment, which
Severance Payment may be conditioned upon the Transferred Employees execution
and return to the Employer (and non-revocation in any time provided by the
Employer to do so) of a comprehensive release of claims in a form acceptable
to Employer (the "Release Condition"). As used herein, the 

 



29

    

 "Severance Payment" shall be a payment equal to the base salary or hourly
wages (assuming a work schedule of no greater than 40 hours per week) that the
applicable Transferred Employee would have earned between the date of his or
her termination of employment and the date that is twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, had he or she remained continuously employed by
Employer during that time.

 

(c) For each Transferred Employee who elects to participate in an Employee
Benefit Plan of Employer or its Affiliate that provides medical, dental,
vision, life, accidental death and dismemberment, or disability benefits (not
including any flexible spending account benefits or health savings account
benefits) (an "Employer Welfare Plan"), the Employer or its Affiliate shall
take all commercially reasonable steps to ensure that the applicable Employer
Welfare Plan: (i) shall not require a physical examination or other proof of
insurability, and shall waive all limitations relating to waiting periods and
pre-existing conditions and actively-at-work requirements, with respect to any
of the Transferred Employees or any dependent of such Transferred Employees
who were covered by Sellers and its Affiliates comparable Employee Benefit
Plans (the "Seller Welfare Plans") as of the Closing Date; and (ii) shall give
credit to the Transferred Employees for expenses paid under the Seller
Welfare Plans during the plan year in which the Closing occurs toward
deductibles, co-insurance, and out-of-pocket maximums against satisfaction of
any deductibles, co-insurance, and out-of-pocket maximums for the plan year
under the Employer Welfare Plans to the same extent that such amounts would
have been credited under the applicable Seller Welfare Plans. Employer will
cause Employers or its applicable Affiliates flexible spending account plans
to implement the 2019 elections made by the Transferred Employees under the
flexible spending account plans of Seller or Sellers Affiliates and shall
cause Buyer or Buyers applicable Affiliate to assume liability for
reimbursement claims for the Transferred Employees with respect to calendar
year 2019 that are submitted for reimbursement on or after the Closing Date.
Seller will provide Employer with such data as may be reasonably necessary for
Employer to implement such elections, and all claims for reimbursement shall
be subject to the terms of Employers or its Affiliates flexible spending
account plans.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, with respect
to the Transferred Employees and to the extent permitted under Applicable
Law, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, transfer to Employer
copies of personnel files (including performance reviews and scores, training
course completion records, and, pursuant to a Transferred Employees specific
written consent, DOT and non-DOT drug and alcohol records), DOT Operator
Qualification Records and OSHA 8-hour HAZWOPER records (each to the extent
applicable) related to such Transferred Employees that are required to be
maintained by Employer or Employers Affiliates as a result of its operations
of the Company.

 

(e) Nothing expressly set forth or implied by this Agreement shall (i)
confer upon any Business Employee, or legal representative thereof, any
rights or remedies, including any right to employment or benefits for any
specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this
Agreement, or (ii) be deemed to amend any employee benefit plan of Seller,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



30

    

(f) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Seller and
its Affiliates are solely responsible for any Liabilities relating to the
employment of the Business Employees prior to the Closing (or, for Transferred
Employees who are on a leave of absence as of the Closing, prior to the date
that such Transferred Employee begins employment with Employer) and shall
timely pay or provide to each Business Employee all remuneration, salaries,
wages, commissions, bonuses, severance pay, vacation, sick and other paid
leave and any other compensation or benefits under any of the Employee Plans
arising out of services performed by such Business Employee in accordance with
normal pay practices. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any Liabilities
relating to the employment of the Transferred Employees on or after the date
that such Transferred Employee begins employment with Employer.

its Affiliates from and against any and all payments required to be made
under, and any and all Liabilities incurred in connection with or arising out
of the Douglas Lease to the extent the same accrue from and after the date
hereof. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause replacement of any guarantee by Seller or any of its
Affiliates related to the Douglas Lease (the "Douglas Guarantee").
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) not to (i) amend the
Douglas Lease in any manner that would, or would reasonably be expected, to
(A) increase Sellers or any of its Affiliates liability under the Douglas
Guarantee, or (B) cause the Douglas Guarantee to be drawn upon, or (ii) extend
or renew the Douglas Lease unless, prior to or concurrently with such
amendment, extension or renewal, Seller and its Affiliates are released in
respect of all obligations under the Douglas Guarantee.

 

(b) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company) not to, amend the assigned portion of the Compression
Services Agreement in any manner that would, or would reasonably be expected
to, increase Seller or any of its Affiliates exposure with respect thereto,
or to extend or renew the assigned portion of the Compression Services
Agreement unless, prior to or concurrently with such amendment, extension or
renewal, Seller and its Affiliates are released in respect of all obligations
with respect thereto. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all payments
required to be made under, and any and all Liabilities incurred in connection
with or arising out of the portion of the Compression Services Agreement
related to the Company to the extent the same accrue from and after the date
hereof.

(c) The parties agree to cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts
to assign to the Company the Unisite Agreement and to obtain the release of
Seller and its Affiliates from any liability thereunder accruing from and
after such assignment. Until such time that Seller is able to assign to
the Company the Unisite Agreement, Seller shall cause the Company to receive
the use of, and benefits under, the Unisite Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, (i) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates 

 



31

    

 (including, after the Closing, the Company) not to, amend the Unisite
Agreement in any manner that would, or would be reasonably be expected to,
increase Seller or any of its Affiliates exposure with respect thereto, or
to extend or renew the Unisite Agreement unless, prior to or concurrently with
such amendment, extension or renewal, Seller and its Affiliates are released
in respect of all obligations with respect thereto and (ii) prior to any such
assignment, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, (i) amend
the Unisite Agreement in any manner that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, increase Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company)
exposure with respect thereto following such assignment or (ii) exercise or
waive any rights under the Unisite Agreement without obtaining the prior
written consent of Buyer. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all payments

with or arising out of the Unisite Agreement to the extent the same accrue
from and after the date hereof.

Section 6.07. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion
of Attorney-Client Privilege_.

(a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Company to
waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating
to the representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"),
of Seller or any shareholder, officer, employee or director of Seller or the
Company (any such Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter involving this
Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby,
including any litigation or other dispute proceeding between or among Buyer or
its Affiliates, the Company and any Designated Person, by Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP or any other legal counsel currently representing the Company in
connection with this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated thereby (whether or not such legal counsel also represented
Seller) (the "Current Representation"), even though the interests of such
Designated Person may be directly adverse to Buyer, its Affiliates, the
Company.

 

(b) It is the intention of the parties hereto that all rights to any
attorney-client privilege applicable to communications between Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP and any other legal counsel currently representing the Company in
connection with the Current Representation (whether or not such legal counsel
also represented Seller) shall be retained solely by Seller (and not the
Company); _provided_ that the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of
retention shall not extend to any communication not involving this Agreement
or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby. Accordingly,
the Company shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files
of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other legal counsel currently representing
the Company (whether or not such legal counsel also represented Seller) in
connection with the Current Representation, from and after the Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(i) Seller and its Affiliates shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to the Current Representation, and the Company
shall not be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP or any other legal counsel currently representing the Company in
connection with the Current Representation (whether or not such legal counsel
also represented Seller) constitute property of a client, only Seller and its
Affiliates shall hold such property rights.

 



32

    

(c) Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company), that in the event
of a dispute between Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, arising out of or relating to any matter in
which Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other legal counsel currently
representing the Company in connection with the Current Representation jointly
represented both (i) Seller and (ii) the Company, if applicable, neither the
attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence, nor any
right to any other evidentiary privilege or any work product doctrine will
protect against or prevent disclosure by Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any
other legal counsel currently representing the Company in connection with the
Current Representation to such Seller or an Affiliate of Seller of any
information or documents developed or shared during the course of any such
joint representation.

 

(d) In the event that any third party shall seek to obtain from Buyer or
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) attorney-client
communications involving Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP or any other legal counsel
currently representing the Company in connection with the Current
Representation, then Buyer shall notify Seller of such
application sufficiently in advance of any hearing on the application to
permit Seller to participate in any such proceedings.

 

Section 6.08. _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, except for any
rights or obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements or any Contract set forth on Section 2.04 of the Disclosure
Schedule, (a) Buyer, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates (including
the Company) (collectively, the "Buyer Releasing Parties"), hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever discharges Seller and its
Affiliates (excluding the Company) (collectively, the "Seller Released
Parties") of and from any and all Actions, executions, judgments, duties,
debts, dues, accounts, bonds, Contracts and covenants (whether express or
implied), and claims and demands whatsoever whether in law or in equity
(whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) which the Buyer Releasing
Parties may have against each of the Seller Released Parties in any capacity
related to or affecting the Company occurring or arising on or prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ that this Section 6.08 shall not release any
Seller Released Party from any claim of gross negligence or fraud or willful
misconduct by any Seller Released Party in performing its obligations under
the Construction and Operating Agreement and (b) Seller, on behalf of itself
and each of its Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Releasing Parties"),
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever discharges Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Company) (collectively, the "Buyer
Released Parties") of and from any and all Actions, executions, judgments,
duties, debts, dues, accounts, bonds, Contracts and covenants (whether express
or implied), and claims and demands whatsoever whether in law or in equity
(whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) which the Seller Releasing
Parties may have against each of the Buyer Released Parties in any capacity
related to or affecting the Company occurring or arising on or prior to the
Closing; _provided_ that this Section 6.08 shall not release any Buyer
Released Party from any claim of gross negligence or fraud or willful
misconduct by the Company in performing its obligations under the Construction
and Operating Agreement.

 



33

    

Section 6.09. _Further Assurances_. Each party shall execute and deliver
such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such additional
action as reasonably requested by any other party to effect, consummate,
confirm or evidence the transactions contemplated hereby and carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the
parties discover that assets of the Company were not located on the Companys
properties or titled in the Companys name at the Closing, the parties shall
cooperate to promptly deliver or assign, as applicable, such assets to the
Company.

ARTICLE 7

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 7.01. _Tax Covenants_.

 

(a) Buyer shall not cause or permit the Company or any Affiliate of Buyer,
with respect to the Company, to make or change any material Tax election,
amend any material Tax Return, initiate any voluntary disclosure with respect
to material Taxes, agree to extend or waive any statute of limitations with
respect to material Taxes, take any Tax position on any material Tax Return
or take any other action, in each case, with respect to any material Pass-
Through Income Tax Matter for any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the parties
shall cooperate to make a "push-out" election under Section 6226 of the Code
or any analogous election under state or local Tax law with respect to any
Pass-Through Income Tax Matter for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(b) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared in a manner consistent
with the relevant provisions of the Company LLC Agreement, first drafts of all
Income Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 1065 and similar
forms for state and local Tax purposes) required to be filed by the Company
for all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates or the Company to, prepare or cause to be prepared
first drafts all other Tax Returns for the Company that are due after the
Closing Date. All first drafts of Tax Returns described in this Section
7.01(b) shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to
the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law. At least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing any Tax Return (including extensions)
described in this Section 7.01(b) that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
the party preparing such Tax Return will deliver the first draft of such
Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to the
other party for its review and comment. The non-preparing party shall provide
any reasonable comments to any such draft Tax Return no later than fifteen
(15) days after receipt of such draft from the preparing party, and the
preparing party will cause such Tax Return (as revised to taken into account
the other partys reasonable comments) to be filed timely with
the appropriate Governmental Authority and will provide a copy to the

 



34

    

 non-preparing party. Not later than five (5) days prior to the due date for
payment of Taxes with respect to such Tax Return, the Seller will pay to (or
at the direction of) Buyer the amount of any Seller Taxes (other than any
Seller Taxes described in clause (c) of the definition of Seller Taxes) with
respect to such Tax Return.

 

(c) Except to the extent inconsistent with this Section 7.01(c), any and
all pending or threatened Tax audits, assessments, controversies or
litigation ("Tax Proceedings") of or with respect to the Company shall be
governed by Section 8.05. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall notify
Seller in writing within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including the Company) of written notice of any Tax
Proceedings with respect to a Pass-Through Income Tax Matter for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period (a "Covered Tax Proceeding"); _provided,_ the failure to give such
written notice shall not, however, relieve Seller or any of its Affiliates of
its indemnification obligations (or require any indemnification from Buyer or
its Affiliates), except and only to the extent that the Seller is adversely
prejudiced as a result of such failure. To the extent Seller would have had
control rights under the Company LLC Agreement, Seller shall have the right to
elect in writing, within fifteen (15) Business Days of receiving notice
hereunder, to control, at Sellers sole cost and expense, any such Covered Tax
Proceeding which relates primarily to Pass-Through Income Tax Matters;
provided, that, Buyers rights with respect to any such Tax Proceeding, and
Sellers duties, responsibilities and obligations with respect to such Tax
Proceeding, shall be no less than would be provided for pursuant to the
Company LLC Agreement.

 

(d) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and
any similar Taxes) shall be borne and paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller when
due. The party responsible under Applicable Law for filing any necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes
shall timely prepare and file such documentation and Tax Returns with the
cooperation of the other party. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under Applicable Law, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes.

 

(e) Following the Closing, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, any
payments made pursuant to any provision of this Agreement between Buyer (or
any Affiliate thereof) and Seller (and any Affiliate thereof) shall be treated
by the parties for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, and other applicable Tax
purposes, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

Section 7.02. _Cooperating on Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return or the
handling of any Tax Proceeding.

 



35

    

(b) Buyer and Seller further agree, and agree to cause their respective
Affiliates, upon request, to use all reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or customer of
the Company or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

(c) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to retain or
cause to be retained all books and records pertinent to Taxes of the Company
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the applicable period
for assessment under Applicable Law (giving effect to any extensions or
waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with all record
retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority. From and after the
Closing, Buyer and the Company shall provide, at Sellers cost and expense,
any Tax-related documents, information or other assistance reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with this Agreement.

 

Section 7.03. _Agreed Tax Treatment and Allocation_.

 

(a) __ For U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and applicable state and
local income Tax purposes), the parties hereto agree to treat the purchase
and sale of the Purchased Units as follows, as provided in Revenue Ruling
99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 1): (i) with respect to Buyer, the Company
is deemed to make a liquidating distribution of all of its assets to Seller
and Buyer, and following this distribution, Buyer is treated as acquiring the
assets deemed to have been distributed to Seller in liquidation of Sellers
Purchased Units, and (ii) with respect to Seller, Seller is treated as selling
the Purchased Units (the "Agreed Tax Treatment"). The parties will prepare and
file all Tax Returns consistent with the Agreed Tax Treatment and will not
take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the course of any
proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required by Applicable
Law following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other administrative settlement with or final administrative decision by the
relevant Governmental Authority. The parties shall promptly inform one another
in writing of any written inquiry or Tax Proceeding by any Taxing
Authority with respect to the Agreed Tax Treatment and consult and keep one
another informed with respect to the status of such inquiry or Tax Proceeding.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event
later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a proposed statement (the "Allocation Statement"), allocating the
Purchase Price (and any other items properly treated as consideration for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, to the extent known at such time) among the
assets of the Company in accordance with Section 741, Section 751 and Section
1060 of the Code. If Seller objects in writing to the Allocation Statement
within thirty (30) days of receiving such Allocation Statement, Seller and
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation of
the Purchase Price; _provided_ , that if Seller does not timely object, the
parties shall be deemed to have agreed to Buyers proposed Allocation
Statement. Buyer and Seller shall file all applicable Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the agreed Allocation Statement as finalized under this
Section 7.03 and neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any
position inconsistent with such allocation on any Tax Return, audit,
examination, investigation or similar proceeding, unless required to do so by
Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the parties are
unable to reach a mutual agreement with respect to

 



36

    

 any matter related to the Allocation Statement within thirty (30) days of
any timely objection by Seller pursuant to the prior sentence, each party
shall be permitted to take an independent position with respect to the
Purchase Price allocation on its applicable Tax Returns or in connection with
any audit, examination, investigation or similar proceeding related thereto.

 

Section 7.04. _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the covenants and agreements contained in Article 7 shall
survive for the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving
effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

 

ARTICLE 8

faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) and in
writing by notice from the non-breaching party to the breaching party in
accordance with Section 8.05 and Section 9.01 prior to the expiration date of
the applicable survival period shall not thereafter be barred by the
expiration of the relevant representation or warranty and such claims shall
survive until finally resolved. 

Section 8.02. _Indemnification By Seller_. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article 8, Seller shall indemnify and defend each of Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Company) and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") against, and shall
hold each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each
of them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Buyer Indemnitees based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of Seller contained in the Fundamental Warranties;

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation
to be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

(c) any and all Seller Taxes; or

 



37

    

(d) any Loss arising from or relating to the employment or engagement of:
(i) any Business Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee; or (ii)
the employment or engagement of a Transferred Employee to the extent existing
or arising on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that such Loss
does not arise out of any express obligation of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates under Section 6.05.

 

Section 8.03. _Indemnification By Buyer_. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article 8, Buyer shall indemnify and defend each of Seller
and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnitees") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and
against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Seller Indemnitees based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of Buyer contained in the Fundamental Warranties; or

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation
to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 8.04. _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided for in
Section 8.02 and Section 8.03 shall be subject to the following limitations:

 

(a) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Seller shall be liable
pursuant to Section 8.02(a) shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Buyer shall be liable
pursuant to Section 8.03(a) shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

(c) For purposes of this Article 8, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty, and the calculation of any Losses associated
therewith, shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Material
Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representation or warranty.

(d) In no event shall any Seller Indemnified Party (or the Seller
Indemnified Parties, collectively) be liable for more than 50% of the Losses
of the Company under Section 8.02, other than with respect to any inaccuracy
in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of Seller contained
in Section 3.16. 

(e) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable (except to the
extent payable in connection with a Third Party Claim) for any punitive or
exemplary Losses or special, incidental, consequential or indirect Losses, or
Losses for lost profits or diminution in value.

 

Section 8.05. _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a claim under
this Article 8 is referred to as the "Indemnified Party," and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this Article 8 is referred to as
the "Indemnifying Party."

 



38

    

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is or may be
required to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, but in any event not later than fifteen (15) calendar days after
receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to
the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; 
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or
direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates;  _provided_ that, in such event, the Indemnifying Party may, at
its option and expense through counsel of its choice, participate in (but not
control) the defense thereof. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 8.05(b), it shall
have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute,
defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim
in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense of any such Third Party
Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to
control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall
be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided,_ that if in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal
defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party and which could be
materially adverse to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) the representation of
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same
counsel creates a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable, out-of-pocket, documented fees and expenses of one
counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly
notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided
in this Agreement, or declines to prosecute the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 8.05(b), pay, compromise,
defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses
based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim subject,
in all respects, to the other limitations set forth herein. Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available (records
relating to such 

 



39

    

 Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement
of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, management
employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the
preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, neither the Indemnified Party nor the
Indemnifying Party shall settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the other party, except as provided in this
Section 8.05(b). If an offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim without
leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the
part of the Indemnified Party (other than monetary damages that will be paid
in full by the Indemnifying Party) and provides, in customary form, for
the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying
Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall
give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such offer within ten (10) days after
its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest or
defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the
Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of
such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such offer
and also fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such offer
to settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the
defense pursuant to Section 8.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a
Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall
be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than fifteen (15)
days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim
in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable,
of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such
notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party
shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
the Companys premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any

Section 8.06. _Calculation of Losses_

 

(a) The amount of any Losses payable under this Article 8 by the
Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts recovered by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates under applicable insurance policies (less expenses
(including premium increases) incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting
such amount. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or out-of-pocket expense incurred by
such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification
payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any
expenses (including premium increases) incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount. Each Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall use
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance for any
Losses payable under this Article 8.

 

(b) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any Losses for which such
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement, including by
taking any actions reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party for such
purpose, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary
to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Losses.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
if on the Closing Date, Buyer had Knowledge of any information that would, or
would reasonably be expected to, cause one or more of the representations and
warranties made by the Indemnifying Party to be inaccurate as of the date
made, the Indemnified Party shall have no right or remedy after the Closing
with respect to such inaccuracy and shall be deemed to have waived its rights
to indemnification in respect thereof.

 

Section 8.07. _Payments_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying
Party or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article 8, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) Business
Days of such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The parties hereto agree that should
an Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any such obligations within
such fifteen (15) Business Day period, any amount payable shall accrue
interest from and including the date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or
final, non-appealable adjudication to and including the date such payment has
been made at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest publicly announced
by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the City of New York from time to time
during such period, as such banks Prime Lending Rate. Such interest shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number of days
elapsed.

Section 8.08. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law.

when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect

hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and
of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of

action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
