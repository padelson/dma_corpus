without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party (other than monetary damages that will be paid in full by the Indemnifying Party) and provides, in customary form, for the
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to

practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30)&nbsp;days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall
