permitted hereunder) of such conditions) and (ii) the completion of the

(ii) each Company Common Share that is issued and outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares
or Dissenting Company Shares) will automatically be cancelled, extinguished
and converted into the right to receive an amount equal to $37.00 in cash per
share, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), in accordance with the

2.7. _Dissenting Company Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting
Company Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_, but rather, the holders
of Dissenting Company Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the
appraisal value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL less any applicable Taxes required to be
withheld in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.12 _with respect to such payment
(and, at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Company Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the appraisal value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , that,
if any such holder of Dissenting Company Shares shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment
under and to the extent set forth in and in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective Time), then the
right of such holder to be paid the appraisal value of such
holders Dissenting Company Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Company
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (without interest thereon) as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.6(a)_, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Company Shares.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any
written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the DGCL or any other written communication with the Company
that relates to a demand for appraisal or payment with respect to Dissenting
Company Shares; (B) any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any such
demand; and (C) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL with respect to the
exercise or purported exercise of appraisal rights; and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in, at Parents election and expense, all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment or
settlement offer or settle any such demands prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. Each holder of Dissenting
Company Shares who becomes entitled under Section 262 of the DGCL to receive
payment of the "fair value" for such holders shares shall receive such
payment therefor from the Surviving Company or its designee after giving
effect to any withholdings required by applicable Law (but only after the
amount thereof shall have been finally determined pursuant to the DGCL), and
such shares shall be retired and cancelled as of the Effective Time.

2.8. _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company RSUs_. Subject to the exceptions set forth in _Items 2_ and
_3_ of  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, each
Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that is then vested or would become vested pursuant to its terms on or
before the first anniversary of the Closing Date, will, without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Merger Consideration; multiplied by
(ii) the total number of Company Common Shares subject to the portion of such
Company RSU (the "Company RSU Consideration") that is then vested or would
become vested pursuant to its terms on or before the first anniversary of the
closing date, subject to withholding for all required Taxes pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.12_. Parent will assume all other Company RSUs (the "Assumed
Company RSUs") that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and at the Effective Time each such Company RSU will, without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Company RSU Consideration, which shall vest (if
applicable) and become payable by the Surviving Company to the holder thereof
in accordance with the vesting schedule and terms and conditions applicable
to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
acceleration provisions applicable to the award) and will be subject to
withholding for all required Taxes pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.12_. For
the avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time each Company RSU, including the
Assumed Company RSUs, will cease to represent the right to receive Company
Common Shares and will not represent any right to receive any equity
securities of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

 

(b) _Company_ _LTIP Target PSUs_. Parent will assume all Company LTIP
Target PSUs that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and at the Effective Time each such Company LTIP Target PSU will,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be converted into and will become a right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Merger
Consideration; multiplied by (ii) the total number of Company Common Shares
subject to such Company LTIP Target PSU (the "Company LTIP Target
PSU Consideration"), which shall vest (if applicable) and become payable by
the Surviving Company to the holder thereof in accordance with the time-based
vesting schedule for the award (but in no event earlier than the end of the
applicable performance period) and terms and conditions applicable to such
Company LTIP Target PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
acceleration provisions applicable to the award). For purposes of the previous
sentence, the number of Company Common Shares subject to a Company LTIP
Target PSU in which the performance period applicable to such award has not
been completed as of the Effective Time will be deemed to be the number of
shares eligible to vest based on the target level of performance (which, for
purposes of clarity, shall be the total number of shares subject to the award
in the case of an award with respect to which the performance-based vesting
requirements vest in full on achievement of target performance and was
granted in tandem with a Company LTIP Overachievement PSU), and the
performance-based vesting requirements shall no longer apply to the award from
and after the Effective Time. The payment of the Company LTIP Target PSU
Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.12_. For the avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time
each Company LTIP Target PSU will cease to represent the right to receive
Company Common Shares and will not represent any right to receive any equity
securities of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

 

(c) _Company LTIP Overachievement PSUs_. Parent will assume all Company
LTIP Overachievement PSUs that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by individuals who are employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries at that time, and at the Effective Time each such Company
LTIP Overachievement PSU will, without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and will
become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i)
the amount of the Merger Consideration; multiplied by (ii) the total number
of Company Common Shares subject to such Company LTIP Overachievement PSU (the
"Company LTIP Overachievement PSU Consideration"), which shall vest (if
applicable) and become payable by the Surviving Company to the holder

 thereof in accordance with the vesting schedule, performance-based vesting
requirements, and other terms and conditions applicable to such Company LTIP
Overachievement PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
acceleration provisions applicable to the award). For purposes of clarity, no
adjustment shall be made to the performance metrics applicable to the Company
LTIP Overachievement PSU. The payment of the Company LTIP Overachievement PSU
Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.12_. For the avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time
each Company LTIP Overachievement PSU will cease to represent the right to
receive Company Common Shares and will not represent any right to receive any
equity securities of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company LTIP
Overachievement PSUs held by an individual who is not employed by the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be cancelled without payment at the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Company 2019 Annual Target PSUs._ Parent will assume all Company 2019
Annual Target PSUs that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and at the Effective Time each such Company 2019 Annual Target
PSU will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the holder thereof, be converted into and will become a right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Merger
Consideration; multiplied by (ii) the total number of Company Common Shares
subject to such Company 2019 Annual Target PSU (the "Company 2019 Annual
Target PSU Consideration"), which shall vest (if applicable) and become
payable by the Surviving Company to the holder thereof in accordance with the
vesting schedule, performance-based vesting requirements, and other terms
and conditions applicable to such Company 2019 Annual Target PSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including any acceleration provisions applicable
to the award). For purposes of clarity, no adjustment shall be made to the
performance metrics applicable to the Company 2019 Annual Target PSUs. The
payment of the Company 2019 Annual Target PSU Consideration will be subject to
withholding for all required Taxes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12_. For the
avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time each Company 2019 Annual Target PSU
will cease to represent the right to receive Company Common Shares and will
not represent any right to receive any equity securities of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(e) _Company 2019 Annual Overachievement PSUs._ Parent will assume all
Company 2019 Annual Overachievement PSUs that are outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and at the Effective Time each such
Company 2019 Annual Overachievement PSU will, without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into
and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to (i) the amount of the Merger Consideration; multiplied by (ii) the total
number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company 2019 Annual
Overachievement PSU (the "Company 2019 Annual Overachievement PSU
Consideration"), which shall vest (if applicable) and become payable by the
Surviving Company to the holder thereof in accordance with the vesting
schedule, performance-based vesting requirements, and other terms and
conditions applicable to such Company 2019 Annual Overachievement PSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any acceleration provisions
applicable to the award). For purposes of clarity, no adjustment shall be
made to the performance metrics applicable to the Company 2019 Annual
Overachievement PSUs. The payment of the Company 2019 Annual Overachievement
PSU Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12_. For the avoidance of doubt, at the
Effective Time each Company 2019 Annual Overachievement PSU will cease to
represent the right to receive Company Common Shares and will not represent
any right to receive any equity securities of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 

(f) _Company Options_. Parent will not assume any Company Options that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and at the Effective Time
each Company Option , whether vested or unvested, will, without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Merger Consideration
(less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option);
multiplied by (ii) the total number of Company Common Shares issuable upon
exercise in full of such Company Option (the "Option Consideration").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to
Company

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such Company
Options is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company
Options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof. The payment of the Option Consideration will be subject to
withholding for all required Taxes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12_.

 

(g) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the aggregate (i) Company RSU Consideration owed to all
holders of Company RSUs (other than Assumed Company RSUs); and (ii) Option
Consideration owed to all holders of Company Options. As soon as practicable
after the Closing Date, the applicable holders of Company RSUs (other than
Assumed Company RSUs) and Company Options will receive a payment from the
Company or the Surviving Company (or applicable Subsidiary employer), through
its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to
such holders in respect of Company RSUs (other than Assumed Company RSUs) or
Company Options that are cancelled and converted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.8(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.8(f)_, as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company RSUs (other than Assumed
Company RSUs) or Company Options pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.8(f)_, as applicable, cannot be made through the Companys
or the Surviving Companys payroll system or payroll provider, then the
Surviving Company will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which
check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days
thereafter).

 

(h) _Further Actions_. The Company Board (or, if appropriate, a committee
thereof) will adopt such resolutions, or take action by written consent in
lieu of a meeting, to provide for the treatment of Company Equity Awards as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (including the satisfaction of the
requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act).

 

2.9. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Parent will (i) not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, select a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent for the Merger
(the "Paying Agent"); and (ii) prior to the Effective Time enter into a paying
agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
with such Paying Agent.

(b) _Payment Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for payment to the Company Shareholders pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
consideration to which such Company Shareholders become entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_; provided that, no such deposit shall be necessary
in respect of Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares. Until
disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
cash will be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Company, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United
States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii)
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10,000,000,000 (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available)
(such cash and any proceeds thereon, the "Payment Fund"). No losses with
respect to any investments of the Payment Fund will diminish the rights of any
Company Shareholders. If the Payment Fund is for any reason below the level
required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_ or if all or portion of the Payment Fund is
unavailable for Parent (or the Paying Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly
pay the cash amounts contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_ for any
reason, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Company to, promptly deposit
additional cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is
at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_. Any income from investment of the Payment Fund
shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving Company, and no part
of such income shall accrue

 to the benefit of the Company Shareholders and will be payable to any Person
as the Surviving Company directs. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.9(g)_, the
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than the payment to
Company Shareholders as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in
any event within two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent
and the Surviving Company will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than with
respect to Dissenting Company Shares or Owned Company Shares) of (i) a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Company Common Shares (other than Dissenting Company
Shares or Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates" (if any)); and (ii)
uncertificated Company Common Shares that represented outstanding Company
Common Shares (other than Dissenting Company Shares or Owned Company Shares)
(the "Uncertificated Shares") (A) in the case of Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares not held through DTC, a letter of transmittal in such
customary form as Parent, the Company and the Paying Agent reasonably agree
(which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent); and (B) in the case of Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares held through DTC, instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.6(a)(ii)_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such
Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of
Company Common Shares represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
Upon receipt by the Paying Agent of a letter of transmittal in respect of
Uncertificated Shares not held through DTC, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate
number of Company Common Shares represented by such holders transferred
Uncertificated Shares; by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any Taxes
required to be withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.12_), and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. Upon
receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of
a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares not held through DTC, the
holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1)
the aggregate number of Company Common Shares represented by such holders
transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Merger Consideration (less any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Paying Agent will
accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to
evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of
Uncertificated Shares held through DTC will be required to provide a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order
to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_.

 

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company
will cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that the Paying Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first (1st) Business Day after the
Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, equal to (A) the number of Company Common Shares (other than Owned
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such
nominees immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the
Merger Consideration.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Shares is not registered in the transfer books of the Company, or if
the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the
Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in
the transfer books of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or
transferred is registered in the transfer books of the Company only if such
Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender
and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or
any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name
such Uncertificated Shares are registered.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Company or
any other Party will be liable to a holder of Company Common Shares for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Payment
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent (or the Surviving Company as directed by
Parent) upon demand, and any Company Shareholders who have not theretofore
surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
representing such Company Common Shares for exchange pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.9_ will thereafter look for payment of the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Common Shares
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Merger Consideration to which such
holders may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares as of immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any
such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives)
previously entitled thereto.

 

2.10. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares_. From and
after the Effective Time, (a) all Company Common Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger will no longer be outstanding and
will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Company
Common Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_ or, in the case of Dissenting Company
Shares, the rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. The Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this  _Article_ __ _ II_ will be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Common Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Company of
Company Common Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with
customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they will (subject to
compliance with the payment procedures of _Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_) be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article_ __ _ II_.

 

2.11. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_. Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its
reasonable determination and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the

 Surviving Company or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

2.12. _Required Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Company will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax Laws. To the
extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

2.13. _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Company with full right, title and

of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, and otherwise facilitate such Acquisition
Proposal or assist such Person (and its Representatives and financing sources)
with such Acquisition Proposal (in each case, if requested by such Person) if,
and only if, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
take such action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ would
reasonably be expected to cause the Company Board to violate its fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws; provided that the Company will promptly (and, in
any event, within 24 hours) make available to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to
any such Person or its Representatives that was not previously made available

recommend against such Acquisition Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation, in either case within ten (10) Business Days (or such
fewer number of days as remains prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting) of
a written request from Parent to do so (it being understood that a "stop, look
and listen" statement by the Company Board to the Company Shareholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change); _provided_ , that Parent may only make
such request once with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and once with
respect to any modification or revision to the price, conditions or other
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal that is made public (other than by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives); (D) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement; or (E) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any

 Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably
be expected to cause the Company Board to violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws; _provided_ that the Company Board shall not effect such a
Company Board Recommendation Change unless:

 

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three
(3) Business Days in advance of effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change to the effect that the Company Board has (A) so determined; and (B)
resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(i)_ absent any revision to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)(i)_, which notice will specify the applicable Intervening Event in
reasonable detail;

 

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the
Company and its Representatives, during such three (3) Business Day period,
are reasonably available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in
good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement as would permit the Company Board to no longer determine that the
failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to cause the Company Board
to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; and

(3) following such three (3) Business Day period, after taking into
account any revisions to this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement agreed to
by Parent in writing, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change (other than of
the kind set forth in _clause_ __ _ (B)_ of the definition thereof) in
response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to cause the
Company Board to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; or

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior
Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B)

__ _ (A)_ and _(B)_ unless:

 

(1) following the Notice Period, the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and
that, after taking into account any revisions to this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement agreed to by Parent in writing, the failure to do so
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws;

 

(2) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach of
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_; and 

(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice (it being understood

deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change) to Parent at least three
(3) Business Days in advance of the Company Board taking any of the actions
described in the foregoing  _clauses_ __ _ (A)_ or _(B)_ (the "Notice
Period") to the effect that the Company Board has (A) received a Superior
Proposal; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_; (ii) such notice has included the identity of the
Third Person or Persons making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and has attached a copy of any
Acquisition Proposal (including the financing contemplated by such Acquisition
Proposal), copies of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other

Company Board Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement, the
Company and its Representatives, during the Notice Period, are reasonably
available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to
the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as
would permit the Company Board to determine that such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event of any modification or revision (or proposed written
modification or revision) to the price, conditions or other material terms of
such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)(3)_ with respect to such amended or modified

Company agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, it
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any
Contracts for an acquisition (by stock purchase, merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, purchase of assets, license or similar transaction) of any
ownership interest or assets of any Person that would be reasonably likely to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
Transactions.

 

(f) In no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective

Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to

 reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the
SEC of the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholder
Meeting any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates is discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such filing would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
then the Party that discovers such information will promptly notify the
other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing
such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the
appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable Law or the SEC or
its staff, disseminated to the Company Shareholders.

Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company

the Company to advise Parent on a reasonable basis during the last ten (10)
Business Days prior to the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting as to the
aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect to the
Requisite Shareholder Approval.

 

(b) _Adjournment of Company Shareholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn
the Company Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent;
_provided_ , that if the Company or Parent reasonably determines in good faith
that the Requisite Shareholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the
Company Shareholders Meeting, including due to an absence of quorum, then on
no more than two (2) occasions (for each of the Company and Parent) and prior
to the vote contemplated having been taken, each of the Company and Parent
shall have the right to require an adjournment or postponement of the Company
Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional votes in favor
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that no single such adjournment
or postponement pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso shall delay the
Company Shareholders Meeting by more than seven (7) days from the prior-
scheduled date or to a date on or after the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding
the Termination Date; and _provided, further,_ that notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing will prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the
date of the Company Shareholder Meeting if (i) the Company is required to
postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting by applicable Law, any
order of a Governmental Authority or order or request from the SEC or its
staff; or (ii) the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary under
applicable Law to postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting to allow
reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended

Company Board determines (after consultation with outside legal counsel) is
necessary under applicable Law, including in connection with the discharge of
fiduciary duties of the Company Board. The Company agrees that no matters
shall be brought before the Company Shareholders Meeting other than the
Company Merger Vote Matters, the related "golden parachute" vote under Rule

matters (including a proposal to adjourn the meeting, if necessary, to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Shareholder
Approval).

 

(c) The Company agrees that its obligation to hold the Company Shareholder
Meeting pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or by the making of any Company Board
Recommendation Change by the Company Board, and nothing contained herein,
other than the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation, subject to the
ability of the Company Board to take the actions set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, the Company Board shall have
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the terms of  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, then the Company Board shall submit
this Agreement to the Company Shareholders, in which event the Company Board
may communicate the Company Board Recommendation Change or the basis for its
lack of a recommendation to the Company Shareholders in the Proxy Statement
or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.

 6.5. _Treatment of Company Indebtedness_.

(a) _Credit Agreement_. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company will cause to be delivered to Parent a payoff letter
and all other releases, instruments of discharge and similar documentation
required to effect or evidence the release described in  _clause_ __ _ (ii)_

and delivered as of the Closing by the administrative agent under the Credit
Agreement (the "Existing Agent"), which shall (i) indicate the total amount
necessary for the Company to repay and discharge in full all amounts
outstanding pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement (other than for
customary indemnity obligations that expressly survive by their terms) (such
amount, the "Payoff Amount"), (ii) provide for the release, upon payment of
the Payoff Amount at Closing (or replacement, cash collateralization or
backstop of existing letters of credit and other bank services), of all liens
of the Existing Agent securing obligations under the Credit Agreement over the

other bank services, if applicable) that constitute collateral under the
Credit Agreement and any equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that constitute collateral under the Credit Agreement and (iii)
evidence the termination or other satisfaction, upon payment of the Payoff
Amount at Closing (or replacement, cash collateralization or backstop of
existing letters of credit or bank services), of all obligations under the
Credit Agreement (other than for customary indemnity obligations that
expressly survive by their terms). Concurrently with the Effective Time,
Parent will repay and discharge (or provide the funds to the Company to repay
and discharge) such Indebtedness in accordance with the Payoff Letter.

(b) _Existing Notes_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such actions as reasonably may be required with respect to the
Existing Notes in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the Existing
Indentures or under applicable Law, including preparing any notices that may
be required to be delivered prior to or upon the Closing with respect to the
Existing Notes in connection with the Transactions and any repurchases or
conversions of the Existing Notes occurring prior to the Effective Time as a
result of or in connection with the Transactions. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Transactions and the consummation thereof, undertake the
preparation of, and shall execute and deliver, any supplemental
indentures, legal opinions, officers certificates or other documents or
instruments reasonably required in connection with the Transactions and the
consummation thereof pursuant to the Existing Indentures or under any
applicable Law. The Company shall provide Parent and its Representatives
reasonable

 opportunity to review and comment on any notices, certificates, press
releases, supplemental indentures, legal opinions, conversion rate
adjustments, officers certificates or other documents or instruments
deliverable pursuant to or in connection with either or both of the Existing
Indentures prior to the dispatch, making or execution thereof, and the Company
shall promptly respond to any reasonable questions from, and reflect any
reasonable comments made by, Parent and its Representatives with respect
thereto prior to the dispatch, making or execution thereof. In addition, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent following the occurrence of any event
that would require an adjustment to the applicable Conversion Rate (as
defined in the applicable Existing Indenture) or any related or similar
economic terms of any such Existing Indenture or the timing of any conversion,
repurchase or similar rights or obligations under any of the Existing
Indentures. To the extent reasonably practicable, the Company shall provide
Parent and its Representatives with reasonable opportunity to participate in
any discussions between the trustee under any of the Existing Indentures or
any Representative of any such trustee, on the one hand, and the Company or
any of the Companys Representatives, on the other hand.

 

6.6. _Financing_.

 

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit
any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing Letters without
the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), which would, or would reasonably be
expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, including by
changing the amount of the fees to be paid or the original issue discount of
the Debt Financing, to any amount less than the Required Amount; (ii) impose
new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing or any other terms to the Financing
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or
prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing, or
the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, less likely to
occur; (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto; (iv)
materially delay or prevent Closing; or (v) make the funding of any of the
Financings (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining any of the
Financings) less likely to occur (the terms described in the foregoing clauses
(i) through (v), the "Prohibited Terms"); _provided_ that Parent may (without
the consent of the Company) replace, modify, waive or amend the Debt
Commitment Letter (1) in accordance with the "market flex" provisions
thereof; (2) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of
the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms in effect on the date
hereof; (3) reallocate commitments or assign or reassign titles or roles to,
or between or among, any parties to the Financing Letters in accordance with
the terms thereof; and (4) otherwise, so long as such amendment would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impair the ability of Merger Sub
and Parent to consummate the Transaction on the Closing Date pursuant to this
Agreement. Parent shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days) furnish to the Company a copy of any amendment, replacement,
supplement, modification or waiver relating to the Financing Letters. Any
reference in this Agreement to (1) the "Financing" will include the financing
contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or modified; and (2) "Equity
Commitment Letters," "Debt Commitment Letters" or "Financing Letters" will
include such documents as amended or modified.

 

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_.

 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, although the
parties acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a
condition to Closing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange,
consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on or prior to the Closing Date, on
the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the full exercise
of any "flex" provisions in the Fee Letter) described in the
Financing Letters and any related Fee Letter, including, but not limited to,
using its reasonable best efforts to: (A) comply with and maintain in effect
the Debt Financing Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof and hereof; (B) negotiate, execute and deliver

 



\- 64 -

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters on a timely basis on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions in the Fee Letter) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters and related Fee Letter; (C) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and such definitive
agreements related thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letters on or prior
to the Closing Date, in each case, that are within their control; (D) upon the
satisfaction (or waiver) of all of the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (other than the consummation of the Merger and other than
the availability of the Equity Financing and those that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing), consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing, including causing the Financing Sources to fund the Debt
Financing at the Closing; and (E) enforce its rights pursuant to the Debt
Financing Letters.

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, although the
parties acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Equity Financing is not a
condition to Closing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to obtain the Equity Financing at the Closing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, including to: (A)
maintain the Equity Commitment Letter in effect; and (B) consummate the
Equity Financing, including enforcing its rights under the Equity Commitment
Letter and causing the Guarantor to fund the Equity Financing at the Closing.

 

(c) _Information_. Parent, promptly upon request of the Company, shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (including
providing, upon request, copies of all other definitive agreements related to
the Debt Financing and such other information and documentation available to
Parent as shall be reasonably requested by the Company). Parent and Merger Sub
shall give the Company prompt (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
notice in writing (A) of any (1) actual or threatened (in writing) breach,
default (or any event or circumstances that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default),
termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to any Financing Letter
of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (2) breach or default by Parent
or Merger Sub, in each case, of the Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing, or (3) of
any dispute or disagreement between or among the parties to any of the
Commitment Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financings with
respect to the obligation to fund any of the Financings or the amount of the
Financings to be funded at the Closing that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the Closing; (B) of the receipt by Parent or
Merger Sub of any written notice or communication from any Financing Source
with respect to any such actual or threatened breach, default (or any event or
circumstances that, with notice or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default), cancellation, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements
related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or such
definitive agreements; or (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub at any
time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing in an amount equal to the Required Amount on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating
to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B), or (C) of the immediately
preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, failure to obtain all or any
portion of the Financings (or any Alternate Debt Financing) shall not in and
of itself relieve or alter the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
transaction documents referred to herein upon the terms set forth herein and
therein.

(d) _Alternate Debt Financing_. If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable, or Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that
makes any portion of the Debt Financing unavailable on the terms (unless
acceptable to Parent) and conditions (including any "flex" provisions in the
Fee Letter) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent will promptly
notify the Company in writing. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance
referred to in the preceding sentence, Parent and Merger Sub will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the occurrence of such event, (i) arrange and obtain the Debt
Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from the same or 

 



\- 65 -

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 alternative sources in an amount sufficient to assure the availability of
the amount necessary to pay the Required Amount at the Closing (A) on
conditions not less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub in
any material respect than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and
the related Fee Letter (including any "flex" provisions) and (B) containing
conditions to draw, conditions to Closing and related terms that (1) are not
materially more onerous than those conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters and (2) would not reasonably be expected to materially delay the
Closing or make the Closing materially less likely to occur and which shall
not, in any event, contain any Prohibited Terms (the "Alternate Debt
Financing"); and (ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with
respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the "New Debt Commitment Letters"),
which new letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole
or in part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment
Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith or other agreements
related thereto, subject to redaction as permitted by _Section_ __ _
4.11(a)_) to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters
are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Letters"
or the "Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letters to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the
time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in
effect; and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the
"Debt Financing" means the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing, it being understood that if
Parent and Merger Sub proceed with any Alternate Debt Financing, the parties
hereto shall be subject to the same obligations with respect to such Alternate
Debt Financing as set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Debt
Financing.

(e) _Letter of Credit_. The Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to discuss with MUFG Americas Capital Leasing and Finance, LLC ("MUFG")
the return to the Company all cash collateral pledged by the Company to MUFG
in connection with that certain Pledge Agreement dated August 26, 2016 between
the Company and BTMU Capital Leasing and Finance, LLC (predecessor-in-interest
to MUFG) and accept a letter of credit in the same amount as such cash
collateral as a replacement therefor; _provided_ , that such return and
acceptance shall not be a condition to the Closing and the failure of the
Company to comply with this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_ shall not be taken into
account in determining whether the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) is
satisfied.

(f) _No Financing Condition_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance
by Parent and Merger Sub with this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall not relieve
Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations to consummate the
Transactions whether or not the Financing is available, and Parent and Merger
Sub each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing is not a condition
to the Closing.

 6.7. _Financing Cooperation_.

(a) _Cooperation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each of its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees and advisers
to use its respective reasonable best efforts, to provide Parent with all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent to assist it in connection with the
arrangement of Debt Financing, including using reasonable best efforts in
connection with:

 

(i) participating in a reasonable and limited number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies and otherwise reasonably cooperating with the
marketing efforts of Parent and the Financing Sources with respect to the Debt
Financing (including using commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the syndication of the Debt Financing to benefit from the existing banking
relationships of the Company);

 

(ii) assisting Parent and the Financing Sources with the preparation of
rating agency presentations and bank information memoranda customarily
required in connection with the Financing;

(iii) reasonably assisting Parent in connection with the preparation and
registration of any pledge and security documents, supplemental indentures,
currency or interest hedging arrangements and other definitive

Financing Sources (including using reasonable best efforts to obtain consents
of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing, in each case as reasonably requested by Parent), and otherwise
reasonably cooperating with Parent in facilitating the pledging of collateral
and the granting of security interests required by the Debt Commitment
Letters, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_, executing and delivering any
credit agreements, pledge and security documents, guarantees and other
definitive financing documents or requested customary certificates
and documents (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the
Company with respect to solvency matters); _provided_ that except for a
customary authorization letter such documents will not take effect until the
Effective Time;

 

(iv) if any of the Indebtedness of the Company in respect of the Credit
Agreement remains outstanding as of the Closing, obtaining customary payoff
letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge (A) indicating the
amount required for the payoff, discharge and termination in full on the
Closing Date of such Indebtedness and liens thereunder which are required to
be terminated and released substantially concurrently with the Closing
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter to
discharge such Indebtedness at Closing and/or releasing the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries thereunder, and (B) if such Indebtedness is
secured by any liens, agreeing to release such liens upon receipt of the
payoff amount;

rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as amended, to
the extent requested by Parent in writing at least nine (9) Business Days
prior to the expected Closing Date, including a Beneficial Ownership
Certification as defined in 31 C.F.R. §1010.230;

(b) _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_
will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their directors,
officers or employees to (i) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or
agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses or incur any liability of any
kind or cause their Representatives to incur any liability of any kind (unless
such liability is covered as a Reimbursement Obligation) prior to the
Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not
otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent; (ii) cause any condition set
forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_ to fail to be satisfied; (iii) enter into any
definitive certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument prior
to the Effective Time (other than the authorization letters referred to in the
definition of Required Information); (iv) give any indemnities that are
effective prior to the Effective Time; (v) take any action that, in the good
faith determination of the Company, would (A) unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business or the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B) cause any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement to be breached, (C) cause the Company or any
director, manager, officer or employee of the Company to incur any personal

action that will conflict with or violate the Companys Organizational
Documents or any Laws, or result in the contravention thereof, or (E)
reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default
under, any material Contract not entered into in contemplation hereof to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (it being agreed that
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best
efforts to notify Parent and Merger Sub and cooperate in good faith to design
and implement alternative arrangements to avoid such conflicts); (vi) provide
or prepare pro forma financial information, including pro forma costs savings,

 to design and implement alternative disclosure arrangements to enable Parent
or its representatives to evaluate any such information without resulting in
any waiver of such privileges or protections or contravention of Law or
Contract). In addition, no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the
Debt Financing will be effective until the Effective Time (other than with
respect to the authorization letters referred to in the definition of Required
Information), and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to take any action pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument that is not contingent on the occurrence
of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective Time. Nothing
in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ will require (A) any officer or Representative
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or
opinion or take any other action under this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ that could
reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer or
Representative or (B) the Company Board to approve any financing or Contracts
related thereto prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company will be deemed to be in compliance
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ for all purposes hereunder, and Parent shall
not allege that the Company is or has not been in compliance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ for any purpose hereunder, unless (i) Parent provides
reasonably prompt written notice of the alleged failure to comply, specifying
in reasonable detail specific steps to cure such alleged failure in a manner
consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, which failure to comply has not
been cured on or prior to the later of (x) the Closing Date and (y) five (5)
Business Days from receipt of such written notice and (ii) such failure to
comply was a proximate cause of the failure of the Financing to be obtained on
or before the Closing Date.

 

(c) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing so long as such logos
(i) are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, or reasonably likely
to, harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation
or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) are used
solely in connection with a description of the Debt Financing, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, its or their respective businesses and products, or
the Transactions.

 

(d) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential
information provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ will be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted

financing sources and other financial institutions and investors that are or
may become parties to the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing and
limited partners of investment funds that are Affiliates of either of the

6.8. _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company, the Company Board and Parent
shall not take any action that would cause the Transactions to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Law. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state Takeover
Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
the Transactions, each of the Company and Parent shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the Transactions.

hours, upon reasonable advance notice provided in writing to the General
Counsel of the Company, or another Person designated in writing by the
Company, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any
applicable Law or Contract requires the Company to restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents
or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to
such documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound as of the date of
this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or
give a Third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to,
such Contract; (d) access would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
of Third Persons; or (e) such documents or information are reasonably
pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand;
_provided_ that in each case described in  _clauses_ __ _ (a)_ through _(d)_
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to develop alternative methods of providing such information in a
manner that would not result in any violation, default, prejudice or loss of
privilege. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ will be construed to require
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or
other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ will be conducted in a manner that
(i) does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by officers, employees and
other authorized Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
their normal duties, or (ii) create a risk of damage or destruction to any
property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the
Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements. The terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information
obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted or information provided pursuant to the access

any Person who is deemed to be a "director by deputization" under applicable
securities Laws) who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule

 between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of
their respective current or former directors or officers (and any person who
becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time), on the other hand (each, together with such Persons
heirs, executors and administrators, an "Indemnified Person" and,
collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") (whether or not a party to an
indemnification agreement), in effect on the date of this Agreement and made
available to Parent ("Existing Indemnification Agreements"). In addition, from
and after the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable for periods prior to
the Effective Time as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, Bylaws and Organizational
Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of
this Agreement. During such period, such provisions may not be repealed,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable
Law.

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, from and after the Effective Time and

such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to
applicable Law, the Charter, the Bylaws, the Organizational Documents of any
Subsidiary of the Company and the Existing Indemnification Agreements,
as applicable, indemnify and hold harmless, each Indemnified Person from and
against any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, obligations, and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in
connection with any Legal Proceeding or other claim, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or otherwise, whenever asserted, including any
threatened Legal Proceeding or other claim, to the extent that such Legal
Proceeding or other claim arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains,
directly or indirectly, to (i) the fact that an Indemnified Person was at any
time at or prior to the Effective Time a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company or such Subsidiary; and (ii) any action or omission, or alleged
action or omission occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions), in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or taken at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with
serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director,
officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including
any employee benefit plan)); except that if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent
a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding or other claim,
the Surviving Company will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to)
advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as
incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding;
_provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined through a
final, non-appealable court order that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification but only to the extent such repayment is required by
applicable Law, the Charter, the Bylaws or other applicable Organizational
Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable indemnification
agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none
of Parent, the Surviving Company nor any of their respective Affiliates
will settle or otherwise compromise or consent without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Person (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the entry of any judgment with respect
to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding or other claim
for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to
this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all
liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding, including from any monetary
obligations and does not include any equitable relief.

 

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Company

 to) maintain for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, at any time prior to the Effective Time, directors and
officers liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with
respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than those of the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Existing DandO
Insurance"). In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.11(c)_, the Surviving Company will not be obligated to pay annual premiums
in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium,
then the Surviving Company will be obligated to obtain (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Company to obtain) a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance carrier. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect
to the Existing DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for such "tail" policy
does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase
such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to) maintain such "tail" policy
in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for
so long as such "tail" policy is in full force and effect, and the Surviving
Company and Parent will be relieved of their obligations under the first
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(c)_.

 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with
or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving company
or entity in such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns, as applicable, will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Company, as applicable, set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

 

(e) _No Impairment_. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other Persons who
are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred
to in _Section_ __ _ 6.11(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, with
full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons (and other Persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance
or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.11(c)_ (and their heirs
and representatives)) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ will be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons
may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the Organizational
Documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all
indemnification and advancement agreements entered into with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including any Existing Indemnification Agreements);
or (iv) applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations of the Surviving
Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.11_ will be joint and several.

 

(g) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

6.12. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _280G_. Promptly following the date hereof, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to determine whether and to what extent any
payment or benefit that will be made by Parent, the

 



\- 71 -

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
in connection with the Transactions (whether alone or in combination with any
other event) would reasonably be expected to constitute a parachute payment
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

(b) _Employment; Benefits_. For a period of one (1) year following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to) (i) provide each
Continuing Employee with employee benefits (excluding equity-based benefits
or compensation) under plans of the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Company Plans") that are, in the aggregate no less
favorable than those in effect at the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) provide annual rates of base salary or
wages, as applicable, and annual target cash incentive compensation
opportunities (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any equity-based
compensation opportunities) that are no less favorable than as provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(c) _New Plans_. To the extent that a Company Plan or any comparable
compensation or benefit arrangement is made available to any Continuing
Employee at or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for
all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to
benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of
vacation accrual and severance entitlement, but excluding for the avoidance
of doubt any equity, equity based incentive or long term compensation that may
be awarded), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that
it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits for the same period of
service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide that (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee
benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries (other
than the Company Plans) (such plans, the "New Plans") to the extent that
coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a
corresponding Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing life insurance, medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, all
waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan be
waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and
eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date that such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan; and (iii) the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant
to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan be credited with any unused
balance in the account of such Continuing Employee. The Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to) credit any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time to such
Continuing Employee as of immediately following the Effective Time.

(d) _Labor Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the terms and conditions of employment for any Continuing Employees
covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be governed by the
applicable agreement.

 

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee; (ii) subject to the
limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.12_, require Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Employee Plan or

 prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Continuing Employee (or beneficiary or dependent thereof).

_6.13._ _Company ESPP_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company (or, as appropriate, the Board or a
committee thereof) shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP,
that are necessary to provide that: (i) with respect to the offering period
in effect as of the date hereof (the "Current ESPP Offering Period"), no
employee who is not a participant in a particular current offering under the
Company ESPP as of the date hereof may become a participant in that offering
under the Company ESPP and no participant may increase the percentage or
amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on the
date hereof for such Current ESPP Offering Period; (ii) the Current ESPP
Offering Period shall terminate on the earlier of (A) the day immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the day such Current ESPP Offering Period
would otherwise end, and all participant contributions then credited to the
Company ESPP shall be used to purchase Company Common Shares on such date in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP and all other participant rights
under the Current ESPP Offering Period shall be terminated; and (iii) upon
such termination, the Company ESPP shall be suspended and no new offering
period shall be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding any restrictions on transfer of Company Common
Shares in the Company ESPP, all Company Common Shares purchased under the
Company ESPP shall be treated identically to all other Company Common Shares
in the Merger and the payment of the Merger Consideration therefor in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_. The Company shall terminate the
Company ESPP as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time.

material respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, if such

fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such notification will

Financing Sources).

9.7. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, or incapable of being
enforced under any applicable Law, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to
other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 

9.8. _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages
and/or the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take
such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this
Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that: (A) subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_ and this  _Section_ __ _
9.8_, the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at Law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the terms of and the
limitations set forth in this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letters, the
right of the Company to seek an award of specific performance to enforce
Parents obligation to consummate the Merger in circumstances where Parent and
Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been
consummated) in the Chosen Courts without proof of damages; and (B) the right
of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without
that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(i)_ or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed that the right of
the Company to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy
in connection with enforcing Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing
to be funded and to consummate the Merger will be subject to the requirements
that (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_
__ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing (provided that such conditions would
be satisfied as of such date)); (B) the Debt Financing (or, in the case
Alternate Debt Financing has been obtained, such Alternate Debt Financing) has
been funded in accordance with the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters (or the New Debt Commitment Letters, if applicable) or would be funded
at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; (C) Parent
and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_; and (D) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then the Closing would occur. In no event will the Company be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt
Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing).

(iii) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)(iii)_
and this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, the Parties agree not to assert in any action
for specific performance the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law. Any
Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably
waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of the
Companys right to seek specific performance or other equitable relief
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit
the Companys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof and be paid the Parent Termination Fee (provided, that under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in the Merger occurring pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ and the payment of all or any portion of the
Parent Termination Fee) plus any additional amounts contemplated by _Section_
__ _ 8.3(f)(i)_.

 

9.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the internal
Laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without
giving effect to any Laws or other rule (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws or
statutes of limitations of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, including as
it relates to (a) the interpretation of the definition of "Company Material
Adverse Effect" (and whether or not a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred), (b) the determination of the accuracy of any Specified Acquisition
Agreement Representation (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letters) and
whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof the Parent (or any of its
Affiliates) has the right to terminate the Parents (or its Affiliates)
obligations under this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_
of this Agreement or decline to consummate the Merger in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ of this Agreement and (c) the determination of whether
the Merger has been consummated in accordance with the terms hereof and, in
any case, claims or disputes arising out of any such interpretation or
determination or any aspect thereof, which in each case shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof, all matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in
any way relating to an executed Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof or the Debt Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect
to conflicts of laws principles or rules to the extent such principles or
rules are not mandatorily applicable and would require or permit the
application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

9.10. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process
(whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts)
in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Transactions and the Limited
Guarantees, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets,
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ will
affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and
submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware) (the "Chosen Courts") in the event that any dispute or controversy
arises out of this Agreement, the Transactions, the Limited Guarantees or the
transactions contemplated thereby; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court; (d) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in
connection with this Agreement, the Transactions, the Limited Guarantees or
the transactions contemplated thereby will be brought, tried and determined
only in the Chosen Courts; (e) waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts
or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees
not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring any
Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Transactions, the Limited
Guarantees or the transactions contemplated thereby in any court other than
the Chosen Courts; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing,
each party hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in any
Legal Proceeding of any kind or description, whether at Law or in

 equity, in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any Debt
Commitment Letter, Debt Financing, or in each case, the performance thereof or
the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and
New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of
New York and each of the parties hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the New York courts for the purpose any such proceeding. Each party
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert (1) any objection
which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such litigation in any
New York court, (2) any claim that any such proceeding brought in any New York
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and (3) any claim that any New
York court does not have jurisdiction with respect to such proceeding. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any
Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law.

9.11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY ACTION
INVOLVING ANY DEBT FINANCING RELATED PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY
DEBT FINANCING, IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT
THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING

INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY
AGREEMENTS, THE MERGER, THE LIMITED GUARANTEES OR THE OTHER AGREEMENTS TO BE
ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
AND THEREBY. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS
OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.11_.

9.12. _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) may only be made
against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties hereto and only
with respect to the specific obligations undertaken by such Parties as set
forth herein with respect to such Parties and no Parent Related Parties (other
than the Guarantors to the extent set forth in the Limited Guarantees or the
Equity Commitment Letter) or current and future direct or indirect holders of
any equity, controlling persons, Affiliates, Subsidiaries, Representatives,
predecessors, successors, agents, beneficiaries, heirs, members, managers,
direct or indirect general or limited partners, stockholders, shareholders
and assignees of the Company nor any Financing Sources or Debt Financing
Related Parties (collectively, "Non-Party Affiliates") shall have any
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries for any obligations or
liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether at Law
or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the Transactions or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Each Party hereto waives
and releases all such liabilities, obligations, claims and actions against any
such Non-Party Affiliates.

 

9.13. _Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree that any
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an
exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, that are set forth in the corresponding
Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other representations and
warranties (or covenants, as

 applicable) of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub that are set forth in this
Agreement, but in the case of this _clause_ __ _ (b)_, only to the extent
that the relevance of such disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree to be subject to and bound
by the express acknowledgements and agreements of each of Parent and Merger
Sub set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

9.14. _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and
the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it
being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any
such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf., tif, .gif, .jpg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic
Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature,
or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such
defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.
