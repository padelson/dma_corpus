 **ARTICLE 2**

 



 

 **CONVERSION OF SHARES AND MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES**

 



 

2.1 _Conversion of Shares by the Corporate Merger_.

 



 

(a) At the Corporate Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Corporate Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Corporate Merger Sub,
the Company or any holder of any of the Parties securities:

 



 

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock then owned by the Company (or held in
the Companys treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent or Corporate
Merger Sub or any of Parents Subsidiaries shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

 



 

(iii) except as provided in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ of this _Section
2.1(a)_ and subject to _Sections 2.1(b)_, _2.1(c)_ and _2.1(d)_ , (A) each
share of Company Class A Common Stock then outstanding (including any such
shares held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, but excluding any Appraisal Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio, (B) each share of Company Class A-1 Common Stock
then outstanding (including any such shares held by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but
excluding any Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive a
number of shares of Parent Class A-1 Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio
and (C) each share of Company Class B Common Stock then outstanding (including
any such shares held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any
wholly owned

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiary of Parent, but excluding any Appraisal Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Class B Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio; and

 



 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Corporate
Merger Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Corporate Merger Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of any class of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason
of any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification,
recapitalization, or other similar transaction or event, or there occurs a
record date with respect to any of the foregoing, then the Exchange Ratio with
respect to such class and any similarly dependent items, as the case may be,
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock
and Company Equity Awards with the same economic effect as was contemplated by
this Agreement prior to giving effect to such event.

 



 

(c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Corporate Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Class A Common Stock
or Company Class A-1 Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder), in lieu of such
fraction of a share and, upon surrender of such holders Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.5_, shall
receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the product of
(i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent
Class A-1 Common Stock, as applicable, multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted
average price of Parent Class A Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive
trading days ending on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date as
reported by Bloomberg, L.P.. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if any holder of Company Class B Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Class B Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Class B Common Stock
issuable to such holder), such fraction of a share of Parent Class B Common
Stock shall be canceled, and such holder shall not be entitled to any
additional consideration in exchange for such fractional share of Parent Class
B Stock. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any such fractional shares of
Parent Class B Common Stock have no fair value for purposes of Section 155 of
the DGCL.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) if any
holder of Company Class A Common Stock or Company Class A-1 Common Stock is
not an Accredited Investor, such holder shall receive, in lieu of receiving
the consideration set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_, a cash payment, without
interest, in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that such stockholder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and (y) the volume weighted average
price of Parent Class A Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days
ending on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by
Bloomberg, L.P., and (b) if any holder of Company Class B Common Stock is not
an Accredited Investor, then such shares of Company Class B Common Stock shall
be canceled, and such holder shall not be entitled to any consideration in
exchange for such shares.

 



      
 

 



 

2.2 _Conversion of Units by the LLC Merger_.

 



 

(a) At the LLC Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the LLC Merger and without
any further action on the part of Parent Holdco, LLC Merger Sub, Company
Holdco or any holder of any of the Parties securities:

 



 

(i) any Company Holdco Units then owned by Company Holdco (or held in Company
Holdcos treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

(ii) any Company Holdco Units then owned by Parent Holdco or LLC Merger Sub
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

(iii) except as provided in _clauses (i)_ and (ii) of this _Section 2.2(a)_
and subject to _Sections 2.2(b)_ , _2.2(c)_ and _2.2(d)_ , each Company
Holdco Unit then outstanding (including any Company Holdco Units held by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of Company Holdco or any wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent Holdco (including the Company)) shall be converted into the right to
receive a number of Parent Holdco Units equal to the Exchange Ratio; and

 



 

(iv) each limited liability company interest in LLC Merger Sub then
outstanding shall be converted into one limited liability company interest of
the Surviving LLC.

 



 

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the LLC Merger Effective Time,
the Parent Holdco Units or the Company Holdco Units are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization, or other
similar transaction or event, or there occurs a record date with respect to
any of the foregoing, then the Exchange Ratio with respect to such class and
any similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of Company Holdco Units with the same economic
effect as was contemplated by this Agreement prior to giving effect to such
event.

 



 

(c) No fractional Parent Holdco Units shall be issued in connection with the
LLC Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional Parent Holdco
Units shall be issued. Any holder of Company Holdco Units who would otherwise
be entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Holdco Unit (after aggregating
all fractional Parent Holdco Units issuable to such holder), in lieu of such
fraction of a share and, upon surrender of such holders Company Holdco
Certificate or Book Entry Units in accordance with _Section 2.6_, shall
receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the product of
(i) such fractional part of a Parent Holdco Unit multiplied by (ii) the volume
weighted average price of Parent Class A Common Stock for the five (5)
consecutive trading days ending on the date immediately prior to the Closing
Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any holder
of Company Holdco Units is not an Accredited Investor, such holder shall
receive, in lieu of receiving the consideration set forth in _Section
2.2(a)_, a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the product
of (x) the number of Parent Holdco Units that such stockholder

 



      
 

 



 

would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ and (y)
the volume weighted average price of Parent Class A Common Stock for the five
(5) consecutive trading days ending on the date immediately prior to the
Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P.

 



 

2.3 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_. In accordance with the Companys
Amended and Restated 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan (as amended from time to
time, the " _Company Equity Plan_ ") and the applicable award agreements
governing equity-based awards granted thereunder that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, the following
treatment shall apply with respect thereto:

 



 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. By virtue of the Corporate Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of
Company Class A Common Stock granted under the Company Equity Plan (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time
shall, as of the Corporate Merger Effective Time, cease to represent a right
to acquire shares of Company Class A Common Stock and shall be converted into
an option (a " _Parent Stock Option_ ") to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions (including with respect to vesting, exercisability and the ability
to pay the exercise price and satisfy applicable tax or other withholding
obligations by reduction of the amount of shares otherwise deliverable) as
were applicable to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Corporate Merger Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock (rounded, if necessary, down to the nearest whole share) determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Corporate Merger
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent
Class A Common Stock (rounded, if necessary, up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the exercise price per share of Company Class A Common Stock under
such Company Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the adjustments provided in this _Section 2.3(a)_ with
respect to any Company Stock Options, whether or not they are "incentive stock
options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code, are intended to be effected in
a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and Section 409A
of the Code and the respective regulations promulgated thereunder; _provided,
further_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, each Company Stock Option that
entitles its holder to accelerated vesting solely upon the occurrence of a
"Change in Control" (as defined in the Company Equity Plan) pursuant to the
terms of the applicable award agreement governing such Company Stock Option
shall be converted into a Parent Stock Option that is fully vested and
exercisable as of the Corporate Merger Effective Time, as described in this
_Section 2.3(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. By virtue of the Corporate Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each award of Company
Class A Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction
granted under the Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company Restricted Stock
Award_ " and together with the Company Stock Options, the " _Company Equity
Awards_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Corporate Merger
Effective Time, shall, as of the Corporate Merger Effective Time, cease to
represent Company Class A Common Stock and shall be converted into a new award
(each, a " _Parent Restricted Stock Award_ ") of restricted shares, subject to
the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting, forfeiture
and the ability to satisfy applicable tax or other withholding obligations by
reduction of the amount of shares otherwise deliverable) as

 



      
 

 



 

were applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to
the Corporate Merger Effective Time, which consists of the number of shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock (rounded, if necessary, down to the nearest whole
share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Class A
Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award as of immediately
prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) and the Parent Board (or the appropriate
committee thereof) shall take such action and adopt such resolutions as are
required to effectuate the treatment of the Company Equity Awards pursuant to
the terms of this _Section 2.3_, including that (i) the Parent Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall take all corporate action necessary or
advisable to assume and continue the Company Equity Plan subject to any
amendment or termination in accordance with the terms of the Company Equity
Plan; (ii) the Parent Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take
all corporate action necessary or advisable to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock for delivery upon
the exercise of a Parent Stock Option or the vesting of a Parent Restricted
Stock Award; and (iii) the Company Board (or the appropriate committee
thereof) shall take all corporate action necessary or advisable to ensure that
after the Corporate Merger Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to deliver Company Class A Common Stock or any
other securities to any person upon the exercise of Company Stock Options or
the vesting of a Company Restricted Stock Award.

 



 

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Corporate Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall file a new or amended Form S-8 registration
statement or a post-effective amendment to an existing Form S-8 registration
statement (or any other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock available for grant and delivery under the Company Equity
Plan or Parent Equity Plan from and after the Corporate Merger Effective Time
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
contained therein) for so long as such shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
are available for grant and delivery under the Company Equity Plan. In the
event that, prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, the Company changes
the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Class A Common Stock
issued and outstanding, as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the
Exchange Ratio.

 



 

2.4 _Closing of Transfer Books_.

 



 

(a) At the Corporate Merger Effective Time: (i) all holders of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than the Appraisal Shares) that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the
consideration contemplated by _Section 2.1_, cash in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_; and (ii) the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be

 



      
 

 



 

closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time. No further transfer
of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Corporate Merger Effective Time. If, after the
Corporate Merger Effective Time, any shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such shares of Company Common Stock shall be canceled and shall be exchanged
as provided in _Section 2.5_. No later than one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a true and correct stock
ledger of the Company with respect to the Company Common Stock and the Company
Equity Awards. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon such information for all purposes of this Agreement
and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, none of
the Parent Group Parties or the Exchange Agent or their respective Affiliates
shall have any liability to any stockholder of the Company (including any
holder of Company Equity Awards) or any other Person relying on or taking
actions in accordance with such information.

 



 

(b) At the LLC Merger Effective Time: (i) all holders of Company Holdco Units
that were outstanding immediately prior to the LLC Merger Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as unitholders of Company Holdco other than the right
to receive the consideration contemplated by _Section 2.2_, cash in lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock and any dividend or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_; and (ii) the transfer
books of Company Holdco shall be closed with respect to all Company Holdco
Units outstanding immediately prior to the LLC Merger Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such Company Holdco Units shall be made on such
transfer books after the LLC Merger Effective Time. If, after the LLC Merger
Effective Time, any Company Holdco Units are presented to the Exchange Agent
or to the Surviving LLC or Parent Holdco, such Company Holdco Units shall be
canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in _Section 2.6_. No later than
one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a true and correct unit ledger of Company Holdco with respect to the
equity interests in Company Holdco. Parent, Parent Holdco, the Surviving LLC
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon such information for all
purposes of this Agreement and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, none of the Parent Group Parties or the Exchange Agent or
their respective Affiliates shall have any liability to any equityholder of
Company Holdco or any other Person relying on or taking actions in accordance
with such information.

 



 

2.5 _Exchange in the Corporate Merger_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent
in the Corporate Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent (by instruction to Parents transfer agent) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Corporate Merger Effective Time,
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant
to _Section 2.1_, bearing customary legends noting that such securities
constitute restricted securities under the Securities Act (or make appropriate
alternative arrangements if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by a book entry will be issued) and an aggregate amount of cash
comprising approximately the amount to be delivered pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent (including as payment in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ and
_Section 2.1(d)_ and any

 



       
 

 



 

dividends or other distributions in accordance with _Section 2.5(c)_) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Corporate Merger Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to
the record holders of Company Common Stock (i) if required by the processes
and procedures of the Exchange Agent, a letter of transmittal in customary
form and containing such provisions as Parent and the Company reasonably agree
prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time (including a provision confirming
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent
or, in the case of Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set
forth in the letter of transmittal) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificates and Book Entry
Shares in exchange for (A) certificates representing Parent Common Stock
bearing customary legends noting that such securities constitute restricted
securities under the Securities Act (or appropriate alternative arrangements
if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock represented by a book entry
will be issued) or cash in lieu of such shares as provided in _Section
2.1(d)_, (B) any cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ and (C) any dividends or other distributions
payment pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_. Exchange of any Book Entry Shares shall
be effected in accordance with the Exchange Agents customary procedures with
respect to securities represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Company
Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share to the Exchange Agent for exchange,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the holder of
such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (or uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by a book entry) that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.1 _or cash in lieu of such shares as
provided in _Section 2.1(d)_, cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.5(c)_. The Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.5_, each Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be
deemed, from and after the Corporate Merger Effective Time, to represent only
the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1
_or cash in lieu of such shares as provided in _Section 2.1(d)_, cash in lieu
of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_. If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, Parent or the Exchange
Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of
any certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such
lost, stolen, or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent or the Exchange Agent
may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Exchange Agent, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate.

 



 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Corporate Merger Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the Corporate Merger until
such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry

 



      
 

 



 

Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.5_ (at which time such holder shall
be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable escheat law or similar Legal
Requirement, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without
interest).

 



 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares as of the date 12 months after
the Corporate Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand,
and any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have
not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry
Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.5_ and submitted a letter of
transmittal, shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their
claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock, and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock, in each case without interest thereon.

 



 

(e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company, Corporate Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent Holdco, Company Holdco, and the Surviving LLC
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local, or
non-U.S. Tax Legal Requirements or under any other applicable Legal
Requirement (and to the extent deduction and withholding is required, such
deduction and withholding may be taken in Parent Common Stock). To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant
Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid, and, if withholding is taken in Parent Common Stock,
the relevant withholding party shall be treated as having sold such Parent
Common Stock on behalf of such Person for an amount of cash equal to the fair
market value thereof at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash
proceeds to the appropriate Tax authority.

 



 

(f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect
to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, properly delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law, or
similar Legal Requirement.

 



 

2.6 _Exchange in the LLC Merger_.

 



 

(a) Parent Holdco shall make available to the Exchange Agent as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the LLC Merger Effective Time, certificates
representing the Parent Holdco Units issuable pursuant to _Section 2.2_,
bearing customary legends noting that such securities constitute restricted
securities under the Securities Act (or make appropriate alternative
arrangements if uncertificated Parent Holdco Units represented by a book entry
will be issued) and an aggregate amount of cash comprising approximately the
amount to be delivered pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_. Any cash and Parent
Holdco Units deposited with the Exchange Agent (including in accordance with
_Section 2.2(c)_ and _Section 2.2(d)_ and any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_) shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Holdco Exchange Fund_."

 



      
 

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the LLC Merger Effective Time,
the Surviving LLC shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to the record
holders of Company Holdco Units (i) if required by the processes and
procedures of the Exchange Agent, a letter of transmittal in customary form
and containing such provisions as Parent and the Company reasonably agree
prior to the LLC Merger Effective Time (including a provision confirming that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Company Holdco Certificates to the Exchange Agent or,
in the case of Book Entry Units, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in
the letter of transmittal) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such holders Company Holdco Certificates and Book Entry Units in
exchange for (A) certificates representing Parent Holdco Units bearing
customary legends noting that such securities constitute restricted securities
under the Securities Act (or appropriate alternative arrangements if
uncertificated Parent Holdco Units represented by a book entry will be issued)
or cash in lieu of such units as provided in _Section 2.2(d)_, (B) any cash
in lieu of any fractional Parent Holdco Unit pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and
(C) any dividends or other distributions payment pursuant to _Section
2.6(c)_. Exchange of any Book Entry Units shall be effected in accordance with
the Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to securities
represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Company Holdco Certificate or
Book Entry Unit to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal, joinder to the Parent Holdco LLC Agreement and
such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or
Parent, the holder of such Company Holdco Certificate or Book Entry Units
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing
the number of whole Parent Holdco Units (or uncertificated Parent Holdco Units
represented by a book entry) that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.2 _or cash in lieu of such units as
provided in _Section 2.2(d)_, cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Holdco
Unit and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section
2.6(c)_. The Company Holdco Certificate or Book Entry Unit so surrendered
shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.6_,
each Company Holdco Certificate or Book Entry Unit shall be deemed, from and
after the LLC Merger Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive
Parent Holdco Units pursuant to _Section 2.2 _or cash in lieu of such units
as provided in _Section 2.2(d)_, cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Holdco
Unit and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section
2.6(c)_. If any Company Holdco Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or
destroyed, Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent
Holdco Units, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed Parent
Holdco Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond
(in such sum as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct) as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent,
Parent Holdco, or the Surviving LLC with respect to such certificate
representing Company Holdco Units.

 



 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Holdco Units with a record date after the LLC Merger Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Holdco Certificates
or Book Entry Units with respect to the Parent Holdco Units that such holder
has the right to receive in the LLC Merger until such holder surrenders such
Company Holdco Certificates or Book Entry Units in accordance with this
_Section 2.6_ (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the
effect of applicable escheat law or similar Legal Requirement, to receive all
such dividends and distributions, without interest).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Any portion of the Holdco Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
holders of Company Holdco Certificates or Book Entry Units as of the date 12
months after the LLC Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent Holdco
upon demand, and any holders of Company Holdco Certificates or Book Entry
Units who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Holdco Certificates
or Book Entry Units in accordance with this _Section 2.6_ and submitted a
letter of transmittal, shall thereafter look only to Parent Holdco for
satisfaction of their claims for Parent Holdco Units, cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Holdco Units, and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Holdco Units, in each case without interest thereon.

 



 

(e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company, Corporate Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent Holdco, Company Holdco, and the Surviving LLC
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Holdco Units such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local, or
non-U.S. Tax Legal Requirements or under any other applicable Legal
Requirement (and to the extent deduction and withholding is required, such
deduction and withholding may be taken in Parent Holdco Units). To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant
Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid, and, if withholding is taken in Parent Holdco Units,
the relevant withholding party shall be treated as having sold such Parent
Holdco Units on behalf of such Person for an amount of cash equal to the fair
market value thereof at the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash
proceeds to the appropriate Tax authority.

 



 

(f) Neither Parent Holdco nor the Surviving LLC shall be liable to any holder
or former holder of Company Holdco Units or to any other Person with respect
to any Parent Holdco Units (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto), or for any cash amounts, properly delivered to any public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law, or similar
Legal Requirement.

 



 

2.7 _Appraisal Rights_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Corporate
Merger Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
applicable shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_,
calculated by applying the Exchange Ratio in accordance with _Section

practicable to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock and the Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to

5.3 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
the Other Party and its Representatives, until the LLC Merger Effective Time,
reasonable access, at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the
officers, key employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of
such Party and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records, contracts and
documents and shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish as
promptly as reasonably practicable to the Other Party and its Representatives
such information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties,
contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to
time, by or on behalf of the Other Party. Each Party and its Representatives
shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Other Party or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt
and timely discharge by the employees of the Other Party and its Subsidiaries
of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.3(a)_, each Party shall not be required to, or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to the Other Party or any
of its Representatives to the extent that such information is subject to
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work-product doctrine or that such
access or the furnishing of such information is prohibited by applicable Legal
Requirements or an existing Contract or agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party shall not have access to personnel records of the Other
Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information that in the Other
Partys good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the Other
Party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party shall not be permitted to conduct any sampling or
analysis of any environmental media or building materials at any facility of
the Other Party or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the
Other Party, which may be granted or withheld in the Other Partys sole
discretion. Each Party agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section
5.3(a)_ for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Financing Sources shall be
included under the definition of "Representatives" therein. All information
provided to any Party or its representatives pursuant to or in connection with
this Agreement is deemed to be "Confidential Information" as defined under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

5.4 _Notification_. The Company shall give notice to Parent as promptly as
reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of any condition, event or
circumstance that will result in any of the conditions in _Section 6.2(a)_ or
_6.2(b)_ not being met, and Parent shall give notice to the Company as
promptly as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of any condition, event
or circumstance that will result in any of the conditions in _Section 6.3(a)_
or _6.3(b)_ not being met; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties,

 



      
 

 



 

covenants or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of
the Parties under this Agreement.

 



 

5.5 _No Solicitation by the Company_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal, request the return
or destruction of all confidential information previously provided to such
parties by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries and immediately
prohibit any access by any Person (other than Parent and its Representatives)
to any physical or electronic data room relating to a possible Company
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Representative
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing confidential information), or induce or take any other action that
could reasonably be expected to lead to any inquiries, proposals or
indications of interest that constitute the making, submission, or
announcement of any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person in
connection with or in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry
or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with
any Person with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve,
endorse, or recommend any Company Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any
letter of intent or similar document or any Contract contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Company Acquisition Transaction. The Company agrees
not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive or permit
the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill," or similar
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and will
enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent.

 



 

5.6 _No Solicitation by Parent_. Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, request the return
or destruction of all confidential information previously provided to such
parties by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries and immediately prohibit
any access by any Person (other than the Company and its Representatives) to
any physical or electronic data room relating to a possible Parent Acquisition
Proposal. Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Representative of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries not to directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing confidential
information), or induce or take any other action that could reasonably be
expected to lead to any inquiries, proposals or indications of interest that
constitute the making, submission, or announcement of any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in response to a Parent

Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse, or recommend any Parent
Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar

5.7 _Information Statement_. Each Party shall cooperate with the Other Party
in the preparation of the preliminary and the definitive Information
Statement, including all amendments or supplements thereto. Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Information Statement as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Information Statement will be
made by Parent without first providing the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, and Parent shall consider in good faith all
reasonable additions, deletions and changes suggested by the Company in
connection therewith. Parent shall notify the Company of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Information Statement
and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall provide to the Company, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, copies of all written correspondence between Parent or
any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Information
Statement. If any comments are received from the staff of the SEC with respect
to the preliminary Information Statement, Parent shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to such comments. The Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, provide Parent with such information as may be
required to be included in the Information Statement or as may be reasonably
required to respond to any comment of the SEC. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after all comments received from the staff of the SEC have been
cleared by the SEC, Parent shall file the definitive Information Statement
with the SEC and cause such definitive Information Statement to be mailed to
its stockholders of record. If at any time prior to the LLC Merger Effective
Time, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Information Statement, so that the Information Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the Other Party, and Parent shall promptly file with the SEC
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the
extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, disseminate such amendment
or supplement to the stockholders of Parent.

 



 

5.8 _Cooperation; Regulatory Approvals_.

 



 

(a) Except to the extent that the Parties obligations are specifically set
forth elsewhere in this _Article 5_, the Parties shall cooperate fully with
each other and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Transactions to
be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable (including by using
reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to closing set forth in
_Article 6_ to be satisfied). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Parties (i) shall make all filings (if any) and give all
notices (if any) required to be made by such Party with any Governmental Body
in connection with the Transactions, and shall submit as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information requested in connection with
such filings and notices, (ii) shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
each Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable
Legal Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by such Party in connection with
the Transactions, and (iii) shall use reasonable best efforts to oppose or to
lift, as the case may be, any restraint, injunction, or other legal bar to the
Transactions. The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable deliver
to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each such notice given, and each
such Consent obtained, by the Company (other than such filings, notices and
Consents related to the HSR Act, the obligations with respect to which are set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in _Section 5.8(b)_). Parent shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable deliver to the Company a copy of each such filing made, each such
notice given, and each such Consent obtained, by Parent (other than such
filings, notices and Consents related to the HSR Act, the obligations with
respect to which are set forth in _Section 5.8(b)_).

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.8(a)_, the Company and
Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement prepare and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, file the notifications required under the HSR Act.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall take all such
further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the
United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or
competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction, or any
other person, may assert under any Legal Requirement with respect to the
Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate, and minimize the impact of, each and
every impediment under any Legal Requirement that may be asserted by any
Governmental Body with respect to the Mergers, in each case so as to enable
the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
no later than the End Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties shall
not be required to take any such action that would cause a Substantial
Detriment; _provided further_ , that Parent may take any reasonable action to
resist or reduce the scope of any action that has been proposed by any such
Governmental Body so long as it does not delay the consummation of the
Transactions to a date later than the End Date. The Company and Parent shall
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests
received from any Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related
matters. Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) give the Other Party notice
as promptly as reasonably practicable of the commencement or threat of
commencement of any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with
respect to the Transactions, (ii) keep the Other Party informed as to the
status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat, and (iii) as promptly as
reasonably practicable inform the Other Party of any material communication
concerning Antitrust Laws to or from any Governmental Body regarding the
Transactions ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall be permitted to
redact any communication to the extent such communication contains
competitively sensitive information, including information relating to the
valuation of the Transactions). Except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, the Company and Parent will
consult and cooperate with one another, and will consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion, or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any Legal Proceeding under or relating to the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law. Subject to the foregoing, Parent shall be
principally responsible for and in control of the process of dealing with any
Governmental Body concerning the effect of applicable Antitrust Laws on the
Transactions. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any Legal Proceeding
under or relating to the HSR Act, the Company will permit authorized
Representatives of Parent to be present at each meeting or conference relating
to any such Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion, or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Body in connection with any such Legal Proceeding.

 



 

5.9 _Disclosure_. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement or
disclosure with respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

Transactions and neither shall issue any press release or make any public
statement or disclosure regarding the Transactions without the prior approval
of the other (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Legal Requirements or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, in which case the Party proposing to issue such press release or
make such public statement or disclosure shall first, to the extent
practicable, consult with the Other Party about, and allow the Other Party
reasonable time to comment in advance on, such press release, public
announcement, or disclosure.

 



 

5.10 _Tax Matters_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, for U.S. federal
and applicable state and local income tax purposes, (a) the Corporate Merger
is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and (b) the LLC Merger is intended to be treated as an
"assets-over" partnership merger transaction under Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby Company Holdco is treated
as the terminating partnership and Parent Holdco is treated as the resulting
partnership and any cash paid in lieu of fractional Parent Holdco Units is
treated as a "sale within a merger" pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.708-1(c)(4). Each of the Parties will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Mergers to qualify or be treated, and will not take (and will use
its reasonable best efforts to prevent any Affiliate of such Party from
taking) any actions that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers
from qualifying or being treated, as applicable, as described in the preceding
sentence. Each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts
and will cooperate with one another to obtain the opinions of counsel referred
to in _Sections 6.2(e)_ and _6.3(e)_. In connection therewith, (x) Parent
shall deliver to each such counsel a duly executed certificate containing such
representations, warranties and covenants as shall be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to enable such counsel to render its opinions described in
_Sections 6.2(e)_ and _6.3(e)_ , as applicable (the " _Parent Tax
Certificate_ "), and (y) the Company shall deliver to each such counsel a duly
executed certificate containing such representations, warranties and covenants
as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable such counsel to
render its opinions described in _Sections 6.2(e)_ and _6.3(e)_ , as
applicable (the " _Company Tax Certificate_ "), in each case dated as of the
Closing Date, and Parent and the Company shall provide such other information
as reasonably requested by each such counsel for purposes of rendering the
opinions described in _Sections 6.2(e)_ and _6.3(e)_ , as applicable.

 



 

5.11 _Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued in the Corporate Merger
(including shares issuable under any Parent Stock Options) pursuant to this
Agreement to be approved for listing (subject to official notice of issuance)
on the NYSE.

 



 

5.12 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. The Parties shall not take any action
that would cause the Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any
Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Laws become applicable to the Transactions, the
Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

5.13 _Company Stockholder Consent_.

 



 

(a) In connection with the Company Stockholder Consent, the Company shall
comply with Section 228 and Section 262 of the DGCL and the Organizational
Documents of the Company, including mailing any notices required thereby (the
" _Company Notices_ ").

 



 

(b) Each Party shall cooperate with the Other Party in the preparation of any
Company Notices, including all amendments or supplements thereto. The Company
shall prepare the Company Notices as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement. No mailing of any Company Notice (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) will be made by the Company without first
providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and
the Company shall consider in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions
and changes suggested by Parent in connection therewith. Parent shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, provide the Company with such information
as may be required to be included in any Company Notice. As promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
mail or cause to be mailed the Company Notices to its stockholders of record
that have not executed the Company Stockholder Consent. If at any time prior
to the LLC Merger Effective Time, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is
discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to a Company Notice, so that such Company Notice would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the Other Party, and the Company shall
promptly, to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, disseminate
such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. The Parties
shall cooperate to cause the mailing of the Company Notices and the filing of
the definitive Information Statement to occur on or about the same date.

 



 

5.14 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Following the LLC Merger Effective Time, and for at least 12 months
thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided to
those individuals employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately after the LLC Merger Effective Time (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to either (i) the employee benefits provided by the
Company on the date of this Agreement or (ii) the employee benefits provided
by Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.14_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
amend or terminate the employment of any individual or to amend or terminate
any employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement. Nothing in this paragraph
shall be interpreted to require Parent to provide for the participation of any
Continuing Employee in any Parent Benefit Plan. This _Section 5.14_ is not
intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any Person or otherwise to
create any third-party beneficiary hereunder, or to be interpreted as an
amendment to any plan of Parent or any affiliate of Parent. Furthermore,
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
Continuing Employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or
any other Subsidiary of Parent and, subject to any agreement between a
Continuing Employee and

 



      
 

 



 

Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent, the
employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

 



 

(b) Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
the Company shall terminate (or shall cause any of its Subsidiaries to
terminate) any Company Benefit Plans maintained by the Company that Parent has
requested to be terminated by providing written notice to the Company at least
thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, so long as such Company Benefit
Plans can be terminated in accordance with their terms and applicable Legal
Requirements without any adverse consequences with respect to any employee
benefit plan maintained by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates. No
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such Company Benefit Plans have been
terminated.

 



 

(c) Parent acknowledges and agrees that, subject to the satisfaction of
applicable terms and conditions referenced in _Section 5.14(c)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
receive the retention and severance benefits specified in _Section 5.14(c)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule from Parent or its Affiliate.

 



 

5.15 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

 



 

(a) From the Corporate Merger Effective Time and until the six year
anniversary of the Corporate Merger Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ "),
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, each present and former director
and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each natural person
who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
Person if such service was at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, and together with such Persons heirs, executors
or administrators, the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), against any costs or
expenses, including attorneys fees (including the advancement of such costs
and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
settlements incurred in connection with any Legal Proceeding arising out of or
related to such Indemnified Persons service as a director or officer of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such natural persons at
the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Corporate
Merger Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Corporate Merger Effective Time, including actions to enforce this provision
or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Person.

 



 

(b) All rights to indemnification, advancement or expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions under the Companys Organizational
Documents or indemnification Contracts or undertakings existing in favor of
the Indemnified Persons shall survive the Corporate Merger and shall be
observed by the Surviving Corporation in the Corporate Merger without any
further action. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the
Corporate Merger Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements, the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons
with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in

 



      
 

 



 

the Organizational Documents of the Company, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Persons.

 



 

(c) Parent shall purchase, or shall make arrangements for the Surviving
Corporation to purchase, on or prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time,
and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, tail policies to the current
directors and officers liability insurance maintained on the date of this
Agreement by the Company, which tail policies shall be from one or more
insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance and shall be effective from the Corporate
Merger Effective Time through and including the date six years after the
Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed
or occurred prior to or at the Corporate Merger Effective Time, with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
to the insureds as the Companys existing director and officer policies
disclosed in _Section 3.15_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect
to claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred on or
prior to the Corporate Merger Effective Time. If Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such tail insurance policies as of
the Corporate Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) continue to maintain in
effect for the Tail Period the directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance maintained as of the date of this Agreement,
or (ii) purchase comparable directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance for the Tail Period, in each case with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as those provided in the Companys existing director and officer policies
disclosed in _Section 3.15_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the coverage described above cannot be
obtained or maintained, or can only be obtained or maintained by paying
aggregate premiums in excess of 300% of the annual amount currently paid by
the Company for such coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall only be
required to provide as much coverage as can be obtained or maintained by
paying aggregate premiums equal to 300% of the aggregate annual amount
currently paid by the Company for such coverage.

 



 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
respectively, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.15_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.15_ is not prior to, or in
substation for, any claims under any such policies.

 



 

(e) This _Section 5.15_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
continue in full force and effect and is intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Person as a third-party beneficiary. The
rights of the Indemnified Persons under this _Section 5.15_ are in addition
to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the

 



      
 

 



 

Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Contracts or Legal Requirements.

 



 

5.16 _Transaction Litigation_. Each Party shall give the Other Party the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against such Party and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior
written consent of the respective Other Party. Each Party shall cooperate,
shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to cooperate and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to
cooperate, in the defense against such litigation.

 



 

5.17 _Registration Rights Agreement_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, the Company shall assign and Parent shall assume the
Companys rights and obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement,
including any obligation to file with the SEC a shelf registration statement
on Form S-1, or such other form under the Securities Act then available to
Parent, as necessary, providing for the resale of the Registrable Securities
(as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) pursuant to Rule 415 under
the Securities Act, from time to time, by the holders thereof.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing, Parent shall file
with the SEC a shelf registration statement on Form S-1, or such other form
under the Securities Act then available to Parent, as necessary, providing for
the resale of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration
Rights Agreement) pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, from time to
time, by the holders thereof. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by
the SEC as promptly as practicable after the Closing.

its and their officers, directors and employees to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives to, use reasonable
best efforts to provide all reasonable cooperation requested by Parent in
connection with the Debt Financing, and such reasonable best efforts shall
include (i) furnishing Parent with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, including providing Parent with

Required Information reasonably requested by Parent; (ii) participating in a

Parent with pertinent information regarding the assets and operations of the

reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the Debt

requested by Parent; (vii) using reasonable best efforts to provide, if
requested by Parent, authorization letters to the Financing Sources

prior to the Closing, all documentation and other information about Company
and each of its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested in writing by Parent
which relates to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT ACT,
_provided_ , that if any request is made with respect to such materials less
than thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Closing, such documentation and
information shall be provided as soon as practicable after a reasonable
request therefor; and (ix) using reasonable best efforts to take all actions
reasonably necessary to permit the Financing Sources to evaluate Companys
inventory, current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies
and procedures relating thereto. Any information provided by Company in
connection with this _Section 5.18(b)_ shall be prepared in good faith.

 



 

(b) Nothing in _Section 5.18(a)_ shall require the Company to (i) take any
action to the extent that it would unreasonably interfere with its ongoing
business or operations, (ii) enter into any agreement or document related to
the financing that would be effective prior to the Closing (including
amendments to Organizational Documents) or (iii) pay any commitment or other
fees unless promptly reimbursed in accordance with _Section 5.18(c)_.

 



 

(c) Parent shall (i) promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its

_Section 5.18_ and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries from and against any losses, damages, obligations or liabilities
suffered or incurred in connection with the Debt Financing or any assistance
or activities in connection therewith (other than with respect to information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries provided by the Company pursuant
to this _Section 5.18_ or to the extent such liability or obligation arise
from gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of its and their Representatives).

 



 

5.19 _Financing_. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to
be done, all things reasonably necessary or advisable to consummate the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
(subject to any "flex" provisions applicable thereto) on or prior to the
Closing, including using reasonable best efforts to (a) maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment Letter (other than as otherwise permitted by this _Section
5.19_) and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the

Commitment Letter (or with other terms agreed by Parent and the Financing
Sources, subject to the restrictions on amendments of the Debt Commitment
Letter as set forth in this _Section 5.19_), (b) satisfy on a timely basis
(or, at the option of Parent, seek waiver of) all conditions to the Debt

_Section 5.18_), (c) upon satisfaction of such conditions, consummate the
Debt Financing and (d) pay any and all commitment and other fees in a timely
manner that become payable by Parent under the Debt Commitment Letter
following the date of this Agreement. If

conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any related
flex terms), Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative debt financing on terms in the aggregate not materially less
favorable to Parent than the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter. Without the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent may
not (A) amend or modify the Debt Commitment Letter (other than to add
financing sources) if such amendment or modification would (x) reduce the
aggregate amount of the maximum Debt Financing or (y) impose new or additional
conditions to the Debt Financing if such new or additional conditions would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
Transactions or (B) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter, unless such Debt
Commitment Letter is replaced in a manner consistent with the preceding
sentence. In the event that new debt commitment letters are entered into in
connection with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification
of the Debt Commitment Letter permitted pursuant to this _Section 5.19_, such
new commitment letters shall be deemed to be a part of the "Debt Financing"
for all purposes of this Agreement.

reasonable confidentiality obligations.

particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as
an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the

directors or officers. In disclosing information in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, the disclosing Party expressly does

warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, is not intended and
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of
such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties to determine whether any obligation, item or
matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

8.10 _Assignments and Successors_. No Party may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written

Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Dividends (as defined in this Section 4.4(A) below) shall cumulate and accrue
on each issued and outstanding share of Class A-2 Common Stock on a daily
basis, at a rate of seven percent (7%) per annum, based on a 365-day year,
compounded on the Compounding Date, commencing on April 1, 2018, if the Resale

(such event, beginning on April 1, 2018 and including each day of such event
until (and not inclusive of) the date of a Special Dividend Satisfaction Event
(as defined below), the " ** _Special Dividend Accrual Event_** "). Any
dividend that accrues on a share of Class A-2 Common Stock on a daily basis
during the Special Dividend Accrual Event pursuant to this Section 4.4 is
referred to as a " ** _Special Dividend._** " For any other dividends or
distributions, Class A-2 Common Stock will participate with Class A Common
Stock on an as-converted basis in accordance with Section 4.3. A share of
Class A-2 Common Stock shall not, solely by means of sale, transfer or other
disposition, become separated from the right to receive payment of Special
Dividends that have accrued on such share or that may accrue and be paid upon
such share under this Section 4.4(A).

 



 

(B) _Accrual_. Special Dividends shall, commencing upon the occurrence of the
Special Dividend Accrual Event be cumulative and accrue on a daily basis, and

referred to in unissued form as " ** _PIK Class A-2 Common Shares_**."
Special Dividends shall not accrue on or be issuable in respect of PIK Class
A-2 Common Shares. Accrued but unpaid Special Dividends shall be paid through
the issuance of the number of PIK Class A-2 Common Shares due on the
applicable issued and outstanding shares of Class A-2 Common Stock under

_(3)_ , a " ** _Payment Date_** "). The number of accrued PIK Class A-2 Common
Shares to be issued to a holder of shares of Class A-2 Common Stock on a
Payment Date in additional shares of Class A-2 Common Stock shall be equal to
(1) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Class A-2 Common Stock held
by such holder and upon which payment of Special Dividends is due, _multiplied
by_ (2)(a) Accrual Days _multiplied_ by (b)(i) .07 _divided by_ (ii) 365\. The
" ** _Accrual Days_** " means the whole number that is equal to the cumulative
number of days (which need not be consecutive) on which Special Dividends have
accrued as a result of the Special Dividend Accrual Event and are unpaid. The
PIK Class A-2 Common Shares issuable in payment of Special Dividends shall be
issued in the form of shares of Class A-2 Common Stock and, when issued, shall
be deemed to be validly issued, fully paid, outstanding, and non-assessable.

 



 

(D) _Other Rights_. A share of Class A-2 Common Stock confers upon the holder
of such share the benefit of any PIK Class A-2 Common Shares that are accrued
but unpaid upon such share of Class A-2 Common Stock, as if such PIK Class A-2
Common Shares had been issued on (1) the business day immediately prior to a
record date declared by the Corporation with respect to any matter submitted
to stockholders for a vote at a meeting of stockholders of the Corporation
(for so long as shares of Class A-2 Common Stock remain issued and
outstanding), such that the holder of such shares of Class A-2 Common Stock
(in such capacity) shall be entitled to a number of votes at such meeting
equal to the number of all shares of Class A-2 Common Stock plus all accrued
and unpaid PIK Class A-2 Common Shares to which such holder is entitled as of
such record date in respect of such shares of Class A-2 Common Stock,
_provided_ that any fractional PIK Class A-2 Common Share to which such holder
would be entitled (after the aggregation of all PIK Class A-2 Common Shares to
which such holder is entitled) will be rounded down to the nearest whole
number for purposes of voting at any such meeting; (2) the business day
immediately prior to a record date declared by the Corporation with respect to
any dividend benefitting the shares of Class A-2 Common Stock (except a
Special Dividend), such that the holder of such shares of Class A-2 Common
Stock (in such capacity) shall be entitled to receive dividends in respect of
the Class A-2 Common Stock held in an amount equal to the aggregate amount
payable on all shares of Class A-2 Common Stock and all accrued and unpaid PIK
Class A-2 Common Shares to which such holder is entitled as of such record
date; (3) the date of any sale, transfer or other disposition of such share of
Class A-2 Common Stock, subject to Section 4.4(E), below.

 



 

(E) _Transfer_. Any holder of a share of Class A-2 Common Stock electing to
sell or transfer such share, prior to any Payment Date, to a buyer or
transferee, shall be obligated to transfer with such share, to the same buyer
or transferee, any PIK Class A-2 Common Share (or Shares) that is or are
issuable but unpaid in respect of such share of Class A-2 Common Stock. An
issuable PIK Class A-2 Common Share shall not be issued and paid to any holder
who is not also the holder of the underlying share of Class A-2 Common Stock
in respect of which such PIK Class A-2 Common Share became accrued and
issuable. The holder of a share of Class A-2 Common Stock that is to be
permissibly transferred must notify the Secretary of the Corporation and any
transfer agent for the Class A-2 Common Stock, according to instructions
provided by the Corporation or any such transfer agent, of such proposed sale,
transfer or other disposition at least three (3) business days in advance of
the effective date of such permitted sale, transfer or other disposition.

 



       
 

 



 

(F) _Conversion_. Upon the Conversion End Date, any PIK Class A-2 Common
Shares that remain issuable but unpaid as of such date shall be issued and
paid, prior to the Conversion. Immediately thereafter, each share of Class A-2
Common Stock shall automatically be converted into the right to receive one
(1) fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock (including
fractional shares) (the " ** _Conversion_** "). The " ** _Conversion End
Date_** " shall mean the earlier to occur of (1) the end of the Maximum
Accrual Period and (2) the date on which a Resale Shelf is declared effective
by the Commission and the Class A Common Stock is listed on a National
Securities Exchange.

 



 

(G) _Mechanics of Conversion_. The issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock
to holders of shares of Class A-2 Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.4(F)
shall be conditioned on delivery by such holders to the Corporation or any
transfer agent or exchange agent designated by the Corporation of any
transmittal form or transfer instruction and supplemental material as may be
required by the Corporation or such designated transfer agent or exchange
agent. Such transmittal form or transfer instruction shall state the number of
shares of Class A-2 Common Stock held by such holder; _provided_ , that the
Corporation shall certify the number of shares of Class A-2 Common Stock held
by such holder to facilitate such Conversion. Thereupon, the Corporation shall
(1) promptly issue and deliver, or cause its designated transfer agent or
exchange agent to issue and deliver, to such holder the number of whole shares
of Class A Common Stock to which such holder is entitled, in book-entry form
(or, at the election of the holder, in certificated form) and (2) pay to such
holder in cash (based on the Class A Common Stocks fair market value
determined by the Board as of the date of Conversion) the value of any
fractional share of Class A Common Stock that would be otherwise issuable to
such holder. Such Conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of
business on the Conversion End Date, and the person entitled to receive the
shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such Conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Class A Common Stock
on such date.

 



 

(H) _Notice_. Subject to Section 4.4(J), the Corporation shall make available
to each holder of Class A-2 Common Stock information regarding the occurrence
of any (1) Special Dividend Accrual Event (for the first day on which the
Special Dividends accrue and for the day on which such Special Dividends
cease), (2) Special Dividend Satisfaction Date, and (3) Conversion End Date,
in each case within three (3) business days following such occurrences.

 



 

(I) _Protective Provisions_. So long as any share of Class A-2 Common Stock is
issued and outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without first obtaining the
approval (by vote or written consent) of the holders of at least a majority of
the issued and outstanding shares of Class A-2 Common Stock, in addition to
any other vote or consent required herein or by law, amend, alter or repeal of
any provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that
materially adversely alters or changes the voting, dividend or rights to
Conversion of the Class A-2 Common Stock or materially adversely alters or
changes any other rights, powers, preferences, privileges or restrictions of
the Class A-2 Common Stock.

 



 

(J) _Information_ _._ Subject to the final sentence of this Section 4.4(J),
the Corporation shall take commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a
holder of any shares of Class A-2 Common Stock may access information, that
shall be as current as reasonably practicable for the Corporation, regarding
the number of such shares held by, issuable to, and

 



      
 

 



 

issued to such holders (the " ** _Information_** "); _provided_ , that the
Corporation shall retain full discretion regarding timing and any delay for
releasing such the Information to such holders of such shares. The Corporation
shall ensure that any such holder of such shares shall be capable of obtaining
certification of Information pertaining to such holders beneficial ownership
of shares upon written request by such holder to the Secretary of the
Corporation or by other means as shall be specified by the Corporation in its
sole discretion. The Corporation may contract with one or more third-party
service providers to provide Information and services referenced in this
Section 4.4(J), and shall retain full discretion in determining the nature of
and technical details with respect to the Corporations provision of
Information and services referenced in this Section 4.4(J).
