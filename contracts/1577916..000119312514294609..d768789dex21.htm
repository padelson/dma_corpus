Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

B. The Buyer desires to purchase from the Seller, and the Seller desires to
sell to the Buyer, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock
(the " _Purchased Shares_ ").

 

AGREEMENT

In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements of the Parties
hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE I

CLOSING; PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 1.01 _Closing_. Assuming the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions
to Closing set forth in  _Article VI_ (other than those that can only be
satisfied at Closing) (the " _Closing Conditions_ "), the closing of the
Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. local time
on September 1, 2014 or, if all Closing Conditions have not been satisfied or
waived prior to September 1, 2014, on the first calendar day of the month
following the date upon which the Closing Conditions have been satisfied or
waived or such other date and time as may be mutually agreed by the Seller
and the Buyer in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ") at the offices of Katten
Muchin Rosenman LLP, 525 West Monroe Street, Chicago, Illinois 60661, and the
Closing shall be deemed to occur at 12:01 a.m. Chicago time on the Closing
Date or at such other date and time as may be mutually agreed by the Seller
and the Buyer in writing.

 

Section 1.02 _Purchase and Sale of Purchased Shares_. At the Closing, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller
shall sell, transfer and convey to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase
from the Seller, all of the Purchased Shares, free and clear of all Liens
(other than restrictions on transfer under federal and state securities
Laws). 

Section 1.03 _Payment of the Closing Purchase Price_. At the Closing, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer
shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Closing Purchase Price to the Seller by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Seller.

 



1 Section 1.04 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Determination of Closing Adjustment_. Not less than five (5) days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a
schedule setting forth its good faith estimate of (i) Closing Cash ("
_Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (ii) Closing Working Capital (" _Estimated
Closing Working Capital_ ") and (iii) the Closing Indebtedness (" _Estimated
Closing Indebtedness_ ").

(b) _Determination of Post-Closing Adjustment_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event within 60 days following the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to
the Seller a schedule (the " _Closing Schedule_ ") setting forth its good
faith calculation of (i) Closing Cash, (ii) Closing Working Capital, (iii)
the Closing Indebtedness, (iv) the Net Increase, if any, and (v) the Net
Decrease, if any. The Closing Schedule, and the calculations of Closing Cash,
Closing Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness contained therein, shall
entirely disregard (x) any and all effects on the assets or liabilities of the
Company resulting from (A) the Transactions, (B) any financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into by the Buyer or the Company at any time on or after
the Closing Date, or (C) any other transaction entered into by the Buyer or
the Company at the direction of the Buyer in connection with the consummation
of the Transactions (including any investments in the Company at or after the
Closing by the Buyer of cash or other assets), and (y) any of the plans,
transactions, or changes which the Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause
to be initiated or made after the Closing with respect to the Company or its
business or assets. After delivery of the Closing Schedule to the Seller
(including during the period of any dispute hereunder with respect to the
Closing Schedule or the calculations set forth thereon), the Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Company to, assist the Seller and its representatives in their
review of the Closing Schedule and the calculations set forth thereon and
provide the Seller and its representatives reasonable access to the
books, workpapers (including the workpapers of the Buyers and the Companys
accountants) and other records (including schedules, memoranda and other
documents), supporting data, facilities, accountants and employees of the
Buyer and the Company reasonably necessary for purposes of their review of
the Closing Schedule and the calculations set forth thereon; _provided_ , that
any such access or furnishing of such information shall be conducted during
normal business hours under the reasonable supervision of the Buyers
representatives and in such a manner as not to interfere in any material
respect with the normal operations of the Company; and _provided_ , _further_
, that the Seller shall treat all such information as confidential in
accordance with _Section 4.05_ and hereby waives any right to use such
information for any purpose other than in connection with the Transactions or
any dispute relating thereto.

 

(c) _Disputed Final Adjustment_.

 

(i) Within 45 days following the delivery by the Buyer of the Closing
Schedule, the Seller may notify the Buyer in writing (a " _Dispute Notice_ ")
whether it disputes the accuracy of the Closing Schedule and the calculations
set forth thereon. Any Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail
those items in the Closing Schedule that the Seller disputes and the Sellers
proposed calculation of the disputed items in the Closing Schedule. If the
Seller does not deliver a Dispute Notice within such 45-day

 



2  period, then the calculations of Closing Cash, Closing Working Capital and
Closing Indebtedness contained in the Closing Schedule shall be deemed to be
accepted by the Seller as final and shall be deemed conclusive and binding on
the Buyer and the Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event that the
Seller or its representatives reasonably request prior to the end of such
45-day period that the Buyer or the Company provide or make available to the
Seller or its representatives any papers or documents reasonably related to
the Closing Schedule and the calculations set forth thereon within three
Business Days after the request therefor, such 45-day period shall
be extended by one day for each additional day required for the Buyer or the
Company to fully respond to such request; _provided_ _further_ that the Seller
shall not be permitted to make more than three such requests.

 

(ii) If the Buyer disputes all or any portion of the Sellers proposed
modification of the Closing Schedule or the calculations set forth thereon,
then the Buyer shall notify the Seller in writing of such dispute setting
forth in reasonable detail those items that the Buyer disputes and Buyers
proposed calculation of the disputed items in Sellers proposed modification
of the Closing Schedule or the calculations set forth thereon, and the Seller
and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement during the
30-day period immediately following the Buyers receipt of the Dispute Notice
(and all such discussions related thereto shall, unless otherwise agreed by
the Buyer and the Seller, be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence (and any applicable similar state rule)). During such negotiation
period, the Buyer and the Seller and their respective representatives shall
have reasonable access to the books and records of the other Party relating to
the Estimated Closing Cash and Estimated Closing Working Capital and the
working papers of the other Partys accountants prepared in connection with
the Closing Schedule and the Dispute Notice; _provided_ , that any such access
shall be conducted during normal business hours under the reasonable
supervision of the other Partys representatives; and _provided_ , _further_
, that the Seller shall treat all such information as confidential in
accordance with _Section 4.05_ and hereby waives any right to use such
information for any purpose other than in connection with the Transactions or
any dispute relating thereto.

(iii) If, within the 30-day negotiation period described in _Section
1.04(c)(ii)_, the Buyer and the Seller are unable to reach an agreement on the
Closing Schedule and the calculations set forth thereon, they shall promptly
thereafter cause a nationally recognized accounting firm
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and the Seller (the " _Accounting
Arbitrator_ ") to review the disputed items or amounts for purposes of
calculating Final Closing Cash, Final Closing Working Capital and Final
Indebtedness. The Accounting Arbitrator shall, under the terms of its
engagement, have no more than 30 days from the date of referral and no more
than 10 Business Days from the final submission of information by the Buyer
and the Seller within which to render its written decision with respect to
the disputed items (and only with respect to any unresolved disputed items set
forth in the Dispute Notice), and the calculation of Final Closing Cash, Final
Closing Working Capital and Final Indebtedness, as applicable, shall be based
solely on the resolution of such disputed items by the Accounting Arbitrator.
The Accounting Arbitrator shall review such submissions and base its
determination solely on such submissions and upon the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including the

 



3  method of calculating Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Working
Capital as set forth in the definition of such terms under this Agreement). In
resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Arbitrator may not assign a value
to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either
Party or less than the least value for such item claimed by either Party. The
decision of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be deemed final and binding upon
the Parties and enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction. Each of
the Buyer and the Seller shall bear that percentage of fees and expenses of
the Accounting Arbitrator equal to the proportion (expressed as a percentage)
of the dollar value of the disputed amounts determined in favor of the other
Party by the Accounting Arbitrator. " _Final Closing Cash_ " means the Closing
Cash as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.04_ and " _Final
Closing Working Capital_ " means the Closing Working Capital as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 1.04_ and " _Final Indebtedness_ " means
the Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
1.04_.

(d) _Post-Closing Payment_. Within three Business Days following
the determination of Final Closing Working Capital, Final Closing Cash and
Final Indebtedness:

(i) the Buyer shall pay the Net Increase, if any, to the Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing
by the Seller; or

 

(ii) the Seller shall pay the Net Decrease, if any, to the Buyer by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by the
Buyer.

(e) _Interest_. Any amounts required to be paid pursuant to _Section
1.04(d)_ shall bear interest from the date that such payment is required to
be made until the date such payment is actually made at 10% per annum.

 

(f) _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties agree that the provisions of this _Section
1.04_ and the arbitration provisions contemplated hereby shall be the
exclusive procedure, exclusive remedy and exclusive forum of the Parties with
respect to the matters that are or that may be addressed through the purchase
price adjustment contemplated hereby.

to carry on its businesses as now conducted and (b) is, where applicable, duly
qualified to do business and is, where applicable, in good standing in every

obligation of the Seller (assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Buyer), enforceable in accordance with its
terms and conditions, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

Section 2.03 _No Breach_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.03_ , the
execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of this Agreement and the
other agreements, certificates, and documents contemplated hereby to which the

methods of the Company , except as required by applicable Law, and, to the
extent applicable, the conventions provided in _Section 4.04(a)(iv)_. At

withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
the determination of whether to amend any federal consolidated income Tax
Return, or any other Tax Return for an Affiliated Group, in which the Company
was included for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be the sole decision of the
Seller, provided that, without the Buyers prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) the Seller shall not amend any

the Company for any Tax Period beginning after the Closing Date.

non-U.S. Law) for purposes of reporting such items on applicable Tax Returns;

 

(C) that no election shall be made by any Party (or the Company) under

Company;

Price (to the extent permitted by applicable Law).

Unless otherwise required by a determination of a Governmental Authority that
is final, the Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, file a Tax
Return that is inconsistent with any agreement pursuant to this _Section
4.04(a)(iv)_, and the Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to,
take any position during the course of any Tax Contest or other audit or
proceedings that is inconsistent with any agreement pursuant to this _Section
4.04(a)(iv)_.

 



28 (b) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. To the extent permissible under applicable
Laws, the Parties agree to elect (and have the Company elect) to have each
Tax year of the Company end on the Closing Date and, if such election is not
permitted or required in a jurisdiction such that the Company is required to
file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, the Parties agree to use the
following conventions for determining the amount of Taxes attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date: (i) in the case of
any Taxes based on or measured by income, gain, profits, receipts or net
worth of the Company, or any employment, social security, use or other similar
Taxes, or any sales, withholding or similar transaction-based Taxes, the
amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as
if the Company filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the end of the day on the Closing
Date and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, the amount attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
by multiplying the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (i),
any item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization
and depreciation deductions) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date based on the relative number of days in such
portion of the Straddle Period as compared to the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period.

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Seller and the Buyer shall (and the
Buyer shall cause the Company to) (i) assist in the preparation and timely
filing of any Tax Return of the Company, (ii) assist in any audit or other
proceeding with respect to the Tax Returns or Taxes of the Company, (iii) make
available any information, records, or other documents relating to any Taxes
or Tax Returns of the Company, (iv) provide any information reasonably
required to allow the Seller, the Buyer, or the Company to comply with any
information reporting contained in the Code or other applicable Laws and (v)
provide certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Return, that are
necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any
Transfer Tax. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall
retain, and shall cause the Company to retain, and the Seller shall retain,
until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions) have
expired, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules, and other
records or information that may be relevant to such returns for all Tax
periods or portions thereof ending before or including the Closing Date and
shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any such records without first
providing the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to review and copy
the same. Each Party shall bear its own expenses in complying with the
foregoing provisions.

(d)  _Transfer Taxes_. The Buyer shall be responsible for and pay any
documentary, stamp, stock transfer, or similar Tax imposed on the Company or
the Seller as a result of the Transactions and any related penalties or
interest (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ").

 



29 (e) _Tax Contests_.

 

(i) If any Governmental Authority issues to the Company a notice of
deficiency, or of its intent to audit or conduct another proceeding with
respect to a Tax Return or Taxes of the Company, either (1) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (2) that could give rise to a liability
for which the Seller is responsible under this Agreement; or (3) that could
adversely affect the Tax liability of the Seller for any taxable period, then
the Buyer shall notify the Seller of its receipt of such communication from
the Governmental Authority within 10 days of receipt and provide the
Seller with copies of all correspondence and other documents received from
the Governmental Authority. The Buyer shall control any audit or other
proceeding in respect of any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company (a " _Tax
Contest_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , the Seller, at its sole cost and
expense, shall (x) have the right to control (including the settlement or
resolution thereof and the selection of counsel) any Tax Contest to the extent
it relates to income Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (y) have the
right to participate in any other Tax Contest described above (a " _Covered
Tax Contest_ "). The Buyer shall not, and shall not allow the Company to,
settle, resolve, or abandon any Covered Tax Contest without the prior written
consent of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned).

 

(ii) If the Seller elects to control an income Tax Contest for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period as provided in  _Section 4.04(e)(i)_, (1) the Seller shall notify
the Buyer of such intent, (2) the Buyer shall promptly complete and execute,
and promptly cause the Company to complete and execute, any powers of attorney
or other documents and take other reasonable actions that the Seller requests
to allow the Seller to control such Tax Contest, (3) prior to the Seller
taking control, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, control such
Tax Contest diligently and in good faith and after the Seller takes control,
the Seller shall control such Tax Contest in good faith and (4) while it
controls a Tax Contest, the Seller shall (A) keep the Buyer reasonably
informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest, (B) allow the Buyer and
the Company, at their expense, to participate in such Tax Contest and (C) not
settle, resolve, or abandon any such Tax Contest if such settlement,
resolution, or abandonment would result in any Buyer Indemnified Party
incurring any material Tax that the Seller is not obligated to pay or
indemnify under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Buyer
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).

 

(iii) If the Seller elects to participate in a Tax Contest as provided in
_Section 4.04(e)(i)_, (1) the Seller shall notify the Buyer of such intent,
(2) the Buyer shall control, or cause the Company to control, such Tax Contest
diligently and in good faith, (3) the Buyer shall (and shall cause the Company
to) promptly take all actions necessary to allow the Seller (and its counsel)
to fully participate in such Tax Contest and (4) if requested by the Seller,
the Buyer shall settle (or cause the Company to settle) the Tax Contest on
terms acceptable to the Governmental Authority and the Seller (provided that
such settlement will not result in a Buyer Indemnified Party incurring any
material Tax that the Seller is not required to pay under this Agreement).

 

(iv) If the Seller does not control or participate in a Covered Tax Contest,
(1) the Buyer shall cause the Company to control such Tax Contest diligently
and in good faith; (2) the Buyer shall keep the Seller reasonably informed
regarding the status of such Tax Contest; and (3) if requested by the Seller,
the Buyer shall settle (or cause the Company to settle) the Tax Contest on
terms acceptable to the applicable Governmental Authority and the Seller
(provided that such settlement will not result in any Buyer Indemnified Party
incurring any material Taxes that the Sellers are not required to pay under
this Agreement).

 



30 (f) _Tax Refunds_.

 

(i) All refunds of Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as determined in
accordance with the same principles provided for in _Section 4.04(b)_)
(whether in the form of cash received or a credit or offset against Taxes
otherwise payable) shall be the property of the Seller. To the extent that
the Buyer or the Company receives a refund that is the property of the Seller,
the Buyer shall pay the amount of such refund and any interest received from
the Governmental Authority (net of any Taxes of Buyer or the Company
attributable to such refund or credit) to the Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Seller. The amount
due to the Seller shall be payable 10 days after receipt of the refund from
the applicable Governmental Authority (or, if the refund is in the form of
credit or offset, 10 days after the due date of the Tax Return claiming such
credit or offset).

 

(ii) The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts and take such other
efforts reasonably requested by the Seller to claim (and shall cause the
Company to use commercially reasonable efforts and take such other efforts
reasonably requested by the buyer to claim) any refunds that will give rise to
a payment to, or on behalf of, the Seller under  _Section 4.04(f)_.

(g) _Post-Closing Actions_. The Buyer shall not permit the Company to take any
action on or after the Closing Date that could increase the liability of the
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company pre-Closing) for Taxes
or give rise to any indemnification obligation of the Seller under this
Agreement. After the Closing Date, the Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Company) will not, without the prior written consent of the Seller, agree
to any waiver or extension of the statute of limitations relating to any Taxes
of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period.

(h) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All tax allocation and tax sharing agreements,
arrangements, policies and guidelines, formal or informal, express or
implied, that may exist between the Company, on one hand, and the Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand, and all
obligations and rights thereunder, shall terminate as of the Closing
Date, and will have no further effect for any taxable year (whether the
current year, a future year or a past year), and the Company shall cease to
have any liability to make or rights to receive any payment thereunder for any
amounts due in respect of periods ending prior to or on or after the Closing
Date.

Section 4.05 _Confidentiality_. The Seller (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates) acknowledges that the trade secrets and other confidential or
proprietary information and data of the Company (collectively, " _Confidential
Information_ ") are the property of the Company and agrees that the Company
has a protectable interest in such Confidential Information. Therefore, the
Seller agrees that it shall not, and it shall cause its Affiliates to not,
disclose to any unauthorized person or make use of any such Confidential
Information without

 



31  the prior written consent of the Buyer; provided, however, that Confidential
Information shall not include information that (a) is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure, in violation
of this Agreement, by the Seller or its Affiliates or their authorized
representatives, (b) is or becomes available to the Seller or its Affiliates
or their authorized representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source
not reasonably known by such party to be bound by an obligation or duty of
confidentiality, (c) is independently developed by the Seller or its
Affiliates or their authorized representatives after the Closing without use
of any of the Confidential Information or (d) is required to be disclosed by
judicial process or Law (but only after the Seller has, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, provided the Buyer with reasonable notice and
opportunity to take action against any legally required disclosure). Nothing
in this _Section 4.05_ shall limit or otherwise prohibit the Seller or any of
its Affiliates from using or disclosing any Confidential Information in
connection with any dispute arising out of the Transactions.

Section 4.06 _Non-Solicitation of Executives_. From and after the Closing
until the third anniversary of the Closing, the Seller shall not, and it
shall cause its Affiliates to not, directly or indirectly, solicit for hire or
hire as an employee or consultant, or otherwise interfere with the employment
relationship between any person listed on _Schedule 4.06_ and the Company or
the Buyer or their respective Affiliates; provided, however, that nothing in
this _Section 4.06_ shall prohibit the Seller from soliciting or hiring any
individual who responds to a general solicitation not targeted at employees
of the Company or the Buyer or their respective Affiliates.

Section 4.07  _Non-Competition_. From and after the Closing until the fifth
anniversary of the Closing (the " _Restriction Period_ "), the Seller shall
not, and it shall cause its Affiliates to not, engage in or assist any other
Person to engage in, directly or indirectly (as an equity holder, partner,
member, manager, employee, consultant, lender, or other owner or participant
in any Person), in the Covered Business in the Covered Area; provided,
however, that (a) no owner of less than 5% of the outstanding stock of any
publicly traded corporation shall be deemed to engage in its business solely
by reason of such ownership thereof, and (b) the Seller and its Affiliates
shall be permitted to acquire and operate after Closing any Person or
business that engages in the Covered Business in the Covered Area (an "
_Acquired Business_ ") so long as, (i) at the time of such acquisition,
revenue from the Covered Business in the Covered Area represents 10% or less
of the total revenue of the Acquired Business for the 12 month period ending
as of the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding such
acquisition (or reasonably expected revenue for the 12 month period beginning
on the first day of the calendar month following such acquisition) and (ii)
during the Restriction Period, the Seller and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Business and its Subsidiaries) do not take any action intended, or
that would reasonably be expected, to materially increase the portion of the
Acquired Business engaged in the Covered Business in the Covered Area. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this  _Section 4.07_ is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties
agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area
of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this _Section 4.07_
shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within
which the judgment

 



32  may be appealed. As used herein, " _Covered Business_ " shall mean the
business of providing to hospitals and medical practices clinical surveillance
software products used by infection preventionists and pharmacists to
identify at-risk patients, prioritize their actions, and make better decision
by applying rules in real-time to clinical data to identify changes in patient
conditions, as well as to simplify reporting and compliance requirements. As
used herein, " _Covered Area_ " shall mean the United States of America.

Section 4.08  _Non-Solicitation of Customers and Suppliers_. During the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary
thereof, the Seller shall not, and it shall cause its Affiliates to not,
directly or indirectly, attempt, or take any action that would reasonably be
expected, to entice away from the Company any Person who is, or was within the
12 month period prior thereto, a customer or client of the Company, or
otherwise intentionally interfere, or take any action that would reasonably
be expected to interfere, with the business relationship of the Company with
any Person who is, or was within the 12 month period prior thereto, a customer
or client of the Company, in each case, for the primary purpose of
reducing the business conducted by the Company with such Person.

Section 4.09 _Injunctive Relief_. The Seller acknowledges that any breach or
threatened breach of the provisions of _Sections 4.05_ , _4.06_ , _4.07_ or
_4.08_ of this Agreement will cause irreparable injury to the Buyer and the
Company for which an adequate monetary remedy does not exist. Accordingly, in
the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the Buyer and the Company
shall be entitled, in addition to the exercise of other remedies, to seek and
(subject to court approval) obtain injunctive and other equitable
relief, restraining the Seller and its Affiliates from committing such breach
or threatened breach. In addition, the prevailing Party in the final, non-
appealable determination of any action to enforce any rights (other than the
right to obtain injunctive relief) under any provision of such sections shall
be entitled to recover all reasonable, out-of-pocket attorneys fees and costs
incurred by such prevailing Party in connection with such action. The rights
provided under this  _Section 4.09_ shall be in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other rights and remedies available to the Buyer or the Company.

 

Section 4.10 _Reasonable Restrictions_. The Seller represents and warrants (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates) to the Buyer, and acknowledges and
agrees, that: (a) the Seller has carefully read and understands _Sections
4.05_ , _4.06_ , _4.07, 4.08_ and _4.09_ of this Agreement and has had the
opportunity for such sections to be reviewed by counsel, (b) acknowledges
that the duration, geographical scope and subject matter of _Sections 4.05_ ,
_4.06_ , _4.07, 4.08_ and _4.09_ of this Agreement are reasonable and
necessary to protect the goodwill, customer relationships, legitimate
business interests, trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information
of the Company, (c) acknowledges that the Buyer would not have closed the
Transactions without the benefits contained in _Sections 4.05_ ,  _4.06_ ,
_4.07, 4.08_ and _4.09_ of this Agreement, and that the Seller is receiving
substantial consideration in connection with the Closing as a result of the
sale of the goodwill of the Company to the Buyer and (d) understands that
this Agreement is assignable by the Buyer and shall inure to the benefit of
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



33 Section 4.11 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing, (a) the Company and
its business, operations, assets and liabilities shall cease to be insured by
the Sellerss or its Affiliates insurance policies or by any of their self-
insured programs, and neither the Buyer nor the Company shall have any access,
right, title or interest in or to any such insurance policies (including any
claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds), (b) the Buyer
shall be responsible for securing all insurance for the Company and its
business, operations, assets and liabilities and (c) the Buyer shall not
assert, seek to assert or exercise any rights or claims of the Company under
any past or current insurance policy under which the Company is a named or
additional insured. The Seller and its Affiliates may amend any insurance
policies in any manner necessary or appropriate to give effect to this
_Section 4.07_.

 

Section 4.12 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by
any Party and at such requesting Partys expense, the other Party shall
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or
other actions as the requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable to evidence and effectuate the Transactions.

set forth or described in such Schedules or that is otherwise necessary to
correct any information in such Schedules that has been rendered inaccurate
thereby; provided, that such updates shall relate only to actions, omissions
or events that are not prohibited pursuant to this Agreement. For purposes of
determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.05(a)_,
the Schedules delivered by the Seller shall be deemed to include only that
information contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be
deemed to exclude any information contained in any subsequent supplement or
amendment thereto; provided, however, if the Buyer consummates the
Transactions, the Buyer will be deemed to have accepted the Schedules, as
supplemented and amended pursuant to this _Section 5.04_, and accordingly
shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_ for any
breaches of representations, warranties and covenants of this Agreement that
otherwise would have existed but for the information disclosed pursuant to any
such supplements or amendments to the Schedules.

 

Section 5.05 _Filings and Consents_. Each of the Seller and the Buyer shall

the generality of the foregoing, each of the Seller and the Buyer shall give
all notices, make all material required filings with or applications to

agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Seller in
connection with the foregoing, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) oppose, lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or
other order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the
Transactions and (b) to cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.03 and
Section 6.04 to be satisfied and to consummate the Transactions.

 



37 Section 5.06 _Intercompany Accounts_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in _Section 5.01_, except for this Agreement and any
other agreements or instruments entered into in connection with this
Agreement, prior to Closing, all intercompany accounts among the Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall be settled.

which any Buyer Indemnified Party may incur or otherwise become subject to,

Section 8.05 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. Promptly after the assertion by
any third party of any claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against any Person
entitled to seek indemnification under _Section 8.02_ or _Section 8.03_ (an
" _Indemnitee_ ") that results or may result in the incurrence by such
Indemnitee of any Loss for which such Indemnitee desires to seek
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ , such Indemnitee shall notify the
Party from whom such indemnification could be sought hereunder with respect
to such claim (collectively, the " _Indemnitor_ ") of such claim in writing
promptly after receiving notice of such claim, describing the claim, the
amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in
reasonable detail (such written notice, an " _Indemnification Notice_ ");
_provided_ that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that such failure
shall have caused the Losses for which the Indemnitor is obligated to be
greater than such Losses would have been had the Indemnitee given the
Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder or except to the extent that such
Indemnitor is otherwise materially prejudiced as a result thereof. Any
Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an
Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at
its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof (other than a Third
Party Claim in which Buyer is the Indemnitee and such Third Party Claim
entails

 



45  reputational risk in Buyers reasonable judgment (including any Third Party
Claims regarding qui tam/False Claims Act) by appointing a reputable counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection
with such defense; _provided_ _that_ the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice
for such purpose; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee and shall not be recoverable
from such Indemnitor(s) under this _Article VIII_. With respect to any Third
Party Claim with respect to which indemnification is sought against the
Seller hereunder, the Seller may, at its option, assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim on behalf of the Seller (other than a Third Party Claim in
which Buyer is the Indemnitee and such Third Party Claim entails reputational
risk in the Buyers reasonable judgment (including any Third Party Claims
regarding qui tam/False Claims Act). If the Indemnitor shall control the
defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle
such claims; _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned and/or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or
ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the
Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally
release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to
such claim. In all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide, and the Indemnitee
shall cause its Affiliates to provide, their reasonable cooperation with the
Indemnitor in defense of claims or litigation, including by making employees,
information and documentation reasonably available. In no event shall an
Indemnitee consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the
Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
and/or delayed) if any Indemnitee is seeking or shall seek indemnification
hereunder with respect to such matter; it being understood and agreed, for the
avoidance of doubt, that any such consent of the Indemnitor to any such
consent to the entry of judgment or settlement shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgement that any Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification hereunder with respect to any such Third Party Claim. This
_Section 8.05_ shall not apply to Tax Contests, which shall be governed by
_Section 4.04(e)_.

 

Section 8.06 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under _Section
8.02(a)_ unless and until the Losses incurred by all Buyer Indemnified
Parties, in the aggregate, as a result thereof exceed, in the aggregate,
$585,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Seller shall be liable for
all Losses in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ that the Losses with
respect to any individual breach (or series of similar breaches arising from
the same underlying facts or legal basis) of a representation or warranty
exceed $17,500 (the " _Mini-Basket_ "). In no event shall the Seller be liable
for any Losses under _Section 8.02(a)_ in excess of $11,700,000 in the
aggregate (the " _Cap_ ").

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Cap, the Mini-Basket or the
Deductible shall apply to Losses in connection with the following items: (i)
indemnification under _Sections 8.02(b)_ , _8.02(c)_ and _8.02(d)_ , (ii) the
Fundamental Representations; or (iii) claims of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation; _provided_ that in no event shall the Seller be liable for
any Losses under this _Article VIII_ in excess of the Purchase Price. In no
event shall the Seller be liable for any Losses resulting from any intentional
misrepresentations that, together with all other Losses under _Section
8.02(a)_, exceed $58,500,000 in the aggregate.

 



46 (c) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover under  _Section 8.02_
or _Section 8.03_, (i) for Losses that are for special, consequential,
incidental, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages (other than with respect
to damages arising from any Third Party Claim), (ii) for Losses for lost
profits, income or revenue or diminution in value, (iii) for Losses based upon
any multiplier of the Companys earnings, including earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation or amortization or any other valuation metric, (iv) to the
extent the matter is reserved for or accrued against in the Latest Balance
Sheet or the Closing Schedule and (v) for Losses for which any Indemnified
Party has otherwise been compensated pursuant to any adjustments to
the Purchase Price under _Section 1.04_.

(d) The amount of any recovery by an Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section
8.02_ or _Section 8.03 _shall be net of the foreign, federal, state and/or
local income Tax benefits actually realized by any Indemnified Party, as a
result of the state of facts which entitled such Indemnified Party to recover
from the other Party pursuant to _Section 8.02_ or _Section 8.03_.

(e) The Indemnified Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue and collect on recovery available under, in the case of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, the post-Closing insurance policies of the Company, and,
in the case of the Seller Indemnified Parties, the pre-Closing insurance
policies of the Company and under claims available against any other third
party based on the underlying claim asserted against the Seller or the Buyer,
as the case may be. The amount of any recovery by an Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section 8.02_ or _Section 8.03_ with respect to any
claim shall be reduced by the proceeds actually recovered by such Indemnified
Party under such insurance policies or against such third party with respect
to such claim (net of any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
obtaining such insurance proceeds and any related increases in insurance costs
or premiums caused as a result of such claim). If such Indemnified Party
actually receives proceeds from any insurance carrier or any other third
party in respect of such claim after recovering any Losses pursuant to
_Section 8.02_ or _Section 8.03_, such Indemnified Party shall remit to the
Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, an amount equal to the amount of such
Losses up to the amount of proceeds recovered.

(f) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable actions to
mitigate Losses hereunder after the date on which one or more of the
Indemnified Parties becomes aware of an event, occurrence or action and that
such event, occurrence or action could reasonably be expected to give rise to
Losses.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any
Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification, reimbursement or other
recovery for any amount to the extent any Indemnified Party has already been
indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this
Agreement.

 



47 Section 8.07 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties agree that, from and after the
Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties for any Losses based
upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this
Agreement (including representations, warranties, covenants and agreements)
and the Transactions, whether based in contract or tort or any other theory
of liability, are the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of the
Parties set forth in this _Article VIII_. The provisions of this _Section
8.07_ shall not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action hereunder (a)
with respect to fraud or (b) to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof or to obtain other equitable remedies with respect hereto.

Section 8.08 _Expiration of Indemnification_. No Person shall be liable for
any claim for indemnification under 
_Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.03(a)_ unless written notice (stating in
reasonable detail the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such
claim for indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which
such claim for indemnification is made) is delivered by the Person seeking
indemnification to the Person from whom indemnification is sought prior to the
expiration of the Survival Period, in which case the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which is the subject of such
claim shall survive, to the extent of such claim only, until such claim is
resolved, whether or not the amount of the Losses resulting from such breach
has been finally determined at the time the notice is given, if, but only if,
(a) in the case of a claim made by reason of a Third Party Claim, the written
notice is accompanied by a copy of the written notice of the third party
claimant, and (b) in the case of any claim made other than by reason of a
Third Party Claim, Losses shall have actually been incurred by the Person
seeking indemnification with respect to such claim in good faith at or prior
to the date such written notice is delivered to the Person from whom
indemnification is sought.

Section 8.09 _Limitation on Recourse_. No claim shall be brought or maintained
by any Buyer Indemnified Party or any of their respective successors or
assigns against any present or former officer, director, employee or Affiliate
of any Party which is not otherwise expressly identified as a Party, and no
recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or
based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of
the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants of any Party set
forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto
(including any Schedule hereto) or any certificate delivered hereunder. No
Party may seek the rescission of the Transactions other than in the case of

Party, except that the failure of any Party to comply with such a request
shall not render this Agreement invalid or unenforceable. No Party shall raise
the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic transmission to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted or
communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic
transmission as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract and
each such Party forever waives any such defense.

enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in

[Signature Page to Stock Purchase Agreement] _EXHIBIT A_

 

The Parties recognize that bona fide disputes as to certain matters may arise
from time to time during the Term which relate to either Partys rights
and/or obligations. To have such a dispute resolved by this Alternative
Dispute Resolution (" _ADR_ ") provision, a Party first must comply with
_Section 10.16_ of the Agreement to which this is an exhibit. If the matter
has not been resolved in accordance with such _Section 10.16_, either Party
may initiate an ADR proceeding as provided herein. The Parties shall have the
right to be represented by counsel in such a proceeding.

 

1\. To begin an ADR proceeding, a Party shall provide written notice to the
other Party of the issues to be resolved by ADR. Within fourteen (14) days
after its receipt of such notice, the other Party may, by written notice to
the Party initiating the ADR, add additional issues to be resolved within the
same ADR.

 

2\. Within twenty-one (21) days following receipt of the original ADR notice,
the Parties shall select a mutually acceptable neutral to preside in the
resolution of any disputes in this ADR proceeding. If the Parties are unable
to agree on a mutually acceptable neutral within such period, either Party may
request the President of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution (" _CPR_
"), 366 Madison Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, New York 10017, to select a
neutral pursuant to the following procedures:

 

(a) The CPR shall submit to the Parties a list of not less than five (5)
candidates within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the request, along with
Curriculum Vitae for each candidate. No candidate shall be an employee,
director, or shareholder of either Party or any of their subsidiaries or
Affiliates. Each candidate submitted by the CPR shall (i) be an attorney
licensed to practice law for at least twenty (20) years in the United States
and (ii) have legal or business experience in the pharmaceutical industry.

 

(b) Such list shall include a statement of disclosure by each candidate of any
circumstances likely to affect his or her impartiality.

(c) Each Party shall number the candidates in order of preference (with the
number one (1) signifying the greatest preference) and shall deliver the list
to the CPR within seven (7) days following receipt of the list of candidates.
If a Party believes a conflict of interest exists regarding any of the
candidates, that Party shall provide a written explanation of the conflict to
the CPR along with its list showing its order of preference for the
candidates. Any Party failing to return a list of preferences on time shall be
deemed to have no order of preference.

 

(d) If the Parties collectively have identified fewer than three (3)
candidates deemed to have conflicts, the CPR immediately shall designate as
the neutral the candidate for whom the Parties collectively have indicated the
greatest preference. If a tie should result between two candidates, the CPR
may designate either candidate. If the Parties collectively have identified
three (3) or more candidates deemed to have conflicts, the CPR shall review
the explanations regarding conflicts and, in its sole discretion, may  either (i) immediately designate as the neutral the candidate for whom the
Parties collectively have indicated the greatest preference, or (ii) issue a
new list of not less than five (5) candidates, in which case the procedures
set forth in subparagraphs 2(a)2(d) shall be repeated.

3\. No earlier than forty-five (45) days or later than ninety (90) days after
selection, the neutral shall hold a hearing to resolve each of the issues
identified by the Parties. The ADR proceeding shall take place at a location
agreed upon by the Parties. If the Parties cannot agree, the neutral shall
designate one of the following four cities or its immediate environs: New
York, New York; Atlanta, Georgia; Washington, D.C.; or Wilmington, Delaware.

 

4\. At least fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing, each Party shall submit
the following to the other Party and the neutral:

 

(a) a copy of all exhibits on which such Party intends to rely in any oral or
written presentation to the neutral;

 

(b) a list of any witnesses such Party intends to call at the hearing, and a
short summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness;

(c) a proposed ruling on each issue to be resolved, together with a request
for a specific damage award or other remedy for each issue. The proposed
rulings and remedies shall not contain any recitation of the facts or any
legal arguments and shall not exceed one (1) page per issue.

 

(d) a brief in support of such Partys proposed rulings and remedies, provided
that the brief shall not exceed thirty (30) double-spaced pages. This page
limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR
proceeding.

Except as expressly set forth in subparagraphs 4(a)4(d) and except in the
case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, no discovery shall be required
or permitted by any means, including depositions, interrogatories, requests
for admissions, or production of documents.

5\. The hearing shall be conducted on consecutive days and shall be governed
by the following rules:

 

(a) Each Party shall be entitled to ten (10) hours of hearing time to present
its case. The neutral shall determine whether each Party has had the ten (10)
hours to which it is entitled.

(b) Each Party shall be entitled, but not required, to make an opening
statement, to present regular and rebuttal testimony, documents or other
evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to make a closing argument. Cross-
examination of witnesses shall occur immediately after their
direct testimony. Opening statements, closing statements, rebuttal testimony
and cross-examination time shall be charged against the Party conducting same.

 



2 (c) The Party initiating the ADR shall begin the hearing and, if it chooses
to make an opening statement, shall address not only issues it raised but
also any issues raised by the responding Party. The responding Party, if it
chooses to make an opening statement, also shall address all issues raised in
the ADR. Thereafter, the presentation of regular and rebuttal testimony and
documents, other evidence, and closing arguments shall proceed in the same
sequence.

 

(d) Except when testifying, witnesses shall be excluded from the hearing until
closing arguments.

 

(e) Settlement negotiations, including any statements made therein, shall not
be admissible under any circumstances. Affidavits prepared for purposes of
the ADR hearing also shall not be admissible. Live videoconference or
telephonic testimony will be permitted at the discretion of the neutral. The
neutral shall have sole discretion with regards to the exercise of
its subpoena powers to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production
of documents from Third Parties. As to all other matters, the neutral shall
have sole discretion regarding the admissibility of any evidence.

 

6\. Within ten (10) days following completion of the hearing, each Party may
submit to the other Party and the neutral a post-hearing brief in support of
its proposed rulings and remedies, provided that such brief shall not contain
or discuss any new evidence and shall not exceed thirty (30) pages. This page
limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR
proceeding.

7\. The neutral shall rule on each disputed issue within twenty-one (21) days
following completion of the hearing. Such ruling shall adopt in its entirety
the proposed ruling and remedy of one of the Parties on each disputed issue
but may adopt one Partys proposed rulings and remedies on some issues and the
other Partys proposed rulings and remedies on other issues. The neutral
shall not issue any written opinion or otherwise explain the basis of the
ruling.

8\. The neutral shall be paid a reasonable fee plus expenses. These fees and
expenses, along with the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing
Party (including all expert witness fees and expenses), the fees and expenses
of a court reporter, and any expenses for a hearing room, shall be paid as
follows:

(a) If the neutral rules in favor of one Party on all disputed issues in the
ADR, the losing Party shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of such fees and
expenses.

(b) If the neutral rules in favor of one Party on some issues and the other
Party on other issues, the neutral shall issue with the rulings a written
determination as to how such fees and expenses shall be allocated between the
Parties. The neutral shall allocate fees and expenses in a way that bears a
reasonable relationship to the outcome of the ADR, with the Party prevailing
on more issues, or on issues of greater value or gravity, recovering a
relatively larger share of its legal fees and expenses.

 



3 9\. The rulings of the neutral and the allocation of fees and expenses shall
be binding, non-reviewable, and non-appealable to the extent allowed by law,
and may be entered as a final judgment in any court having jurisdiction.

 

10\. Except as provided in paragraph 9 or as required by applicable Law, the
existence of the dispute, any settlement negotiations, the ADR hearing, any
submissions (including exhibits, testimony, proposed rulings, and briefs), and
the rulings shall be confidential. The neutral shall have the authority to
impose sanctions for unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.

 

11\. The neutral may not award punitive damages. The Parties hereby waive the
right to the award of punitive damages.

 

12\. The hearings shall be conducted in the English language.
