-ix- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 3, 2015 (this " _Agreement_
"), is entered into by and among PMFG, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), CECO ENVIRONMENTAL CORP., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
TOP GEAR ACQUISITION INC., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_"), and TOP GEAR ACQUISITION II LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Successor Sub_ "). The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Successor
Sub are herein referred to collectively as the " _Parties_ " and each
individually as a " _Party_." Capitalized terms used herein (including in the
immediately preceding sentence) and not otherwise defined shall have the
meanings set forth in _Section 10.4_ hereof.

WITNESSETH

 

WHEREAS, each of the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of its
stockholders that the Company, Parent and Merger Sub enter into a business
combination pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
(the " _First Step Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation in the First Step Merger and as a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (the " _First Step Surviving Corporation_ "), on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ");

WHEREAS, the Parties have determined that immediately following
the effectiveness of the First Step Merger, and in pursuance of the overall
plan to combine the business activities of the Company and Parent, the First
Step Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and into Successor Sub (the "
_Second Step Merger_ " and, together with the First Step Merger, the "
_Mergers_ "), with Successor Sub continuing as the surviving entity in the
Second Step Merger and as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "
_Surviving Entity_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability
Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ ");

 

WHEREAS, each of the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
and Successor Sub has unanimously determined that the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with, and in furtherance of,
its business strategies and goals, are fair to and in the best interests of
its stockholders or members, as applicable, and has approved this Agreement
and the Mergers upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Mergers shall be treated as a single integrated transaction, as described in
Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321, and shall qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the " _Code_ ");

WHEREAS, the Parties recognize that if the Mergers do not qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, the
First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will be treated as separate
transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Rev. Rul. 90-95,
1990-2 C.B. 67; and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, certain
stockholders of Parent are executing lock-up agreements in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Parent Lock-Up Agreements_ "), which Parent
Lock-Up Agreements shall become effective only upon the First Step Effective
Time, and a voting agreement in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_
(the " _Parent Voting Agreement_ "), which Parent Voting Agreement shall
become effective upon execution of this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

 



1 ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGERS

 

Section 1.1 The First Step Merger. At the First Step Effective Time and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the DGCL,

_Section 1.2_, continue as the First Step Surviving Corporation and as a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

Section 1.2 The Second Step Merger.

 

Immediately following the First Step Effective Time and subject to and upon

owned subsidiary of Parent. There shall be no condition to the completion of
the Second Step Merger other than the completion of the First Step Merger.

Ohio 45202 on a date to be specified by the Parties (the actual date that the
Closing shall occur being hereafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_"),
which shall be no later than the second Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the conditions
set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature

(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions at the Closing). In
connection with the Closing, each of the Parties shall execute such
instruments and agreements as may be required by the DGCL and the DLLCA, as

as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and, with respect to the Second Step Merger, the DLLCA. The time of

liabilities and duties of Successor Sub as the Surviving Entity. As of the
Second Step Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall be a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

Section 1.6 Subsequent Actions. If, at any time after the Second Step
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall consider or be advised that any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things
are reasonably necessary or desirable to continue in, vest, perfect or confirm
of record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity its right, title or

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGERS ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.1 Effect of the Merger on Company Capital Stock. At the First Step
Effective Time, by virtue of the First Step Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the shares of any capital stock, limited liability company
interests or other equity interests of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
Successor Sub:

(a) all Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ ") held in treasury or owned directly by the Company,
any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, Merger Sub, Successor Sub or
Parent shall cease to exist, and such shares, including any certificates
therefor, shall automatically be cancelled and retired, shall not represent
capital stock of the First Step Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity,
and shall not be exchanged for the Merger Consideration. Shares of Company
Common Stock that are canceled and retired pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_
are hereinafter referred to as " _Excluded Shares_ "; and

(b) each share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Step
Effective Time shall be converted into and become the right to receive the
following consideration:

 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been properly made pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_ and not lost, revoked or changed pursuant to _Sections
2.2(e)_ or _2.2(c)_ (each a " _Cash Electing Company Share_ ") shall (subject
to _Section 2.3_) be converted into the right to receive $6.85 in cash
without interest (such per share amount is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Cash Consideration_ ").

 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been properly made
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and not revoked or changed pursuant to _Sections
2.2(c)_ or _2.2(e)_ (each a " _Stock Electing Company Share_ ") shall (subject
to  _Section 2.3_) be converted into the right to receive the number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") determined
by dividing (A) $6.85 by (B) the Parent Trading Price (such quotient,
calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth, the " _Exchange Ratio_"), (such
per share amount, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Parent Common Stock Consideration_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) if the number determined by dividing $6.85 by the Parent
Trading Price is less than or equal to 0.5282, the Exchange Ratio shall be
0.5282 and (y) if the number determined by dividing $6.85 by the Parent
Trading Price is greater than or equal to 0.6456, the Exchange Ratio shall
be 0.6456. Without limiting the foregoing, without the prior written consent
of Parent, in no event shall the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to this _Article II_ exceed 7,630,000 shares. As used
in this Agreement, the term " _Parent Trading Price_ " means the volume
weighted average trading price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ
Global Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on
the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, as calculated by
Bloomberg Financial LP under the function "VWAP".

 



4 (iii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is not (A) an Excluded Share or
(B) a share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Cash Election or
a Stock Election has been properly made pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and not
revoked or changed pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ (each, a " _Non-
Electing Company Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration or the Parent Common Stock Consideration, as determined
pursuant to _Section 2.3_.

 

(c) Effective as of the First Step Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Step
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of certificates (each, a " _Certificate_
") or evidence of shares in book-entry form (each such share, a " _Book-Entry
Share_ ") that immediately prior to the First Step Effective Time evidenced
such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance
with _Section 3.2_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Merger Consideration_ " with respect to a given share of Company Common
Stock shall mean either the Cash Consideration (with respect to a share of
Company Common Stock representing the right to receive the Cash Consideration)
or the Parent Common Stock Consideration (with respect to a share of Company
Common Stock representing the right to receive the Parent Common Stock
Consideration).

 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
(including any certificates or scrips representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock) shall be issued in respect of shares of Company Common
Stock that are to be converted in the First Step Merger into the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock (other than Excluded Shares) shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise have been entitled pursuant to _Sections 2.1(b)_ and _2.3_ , an
amount in cash (without interest), rounded up to the nearest whole cent,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder
immediately prior to the First Step Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares), such holders unrevoked Cash Elections and Stock Elections and the
provisions of _Section 2.3_) by (ii) the Parent Trading Price. For purposes
of determining any fractional shares interest, to the extent practicable, all
shares of Company Common Stock owned by a holder of record of Company Common
Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable to such holder of record of Company Common Stock (other
than holders of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares). For the avoidance
of doubt, to the extent practicable, the amount of cash per share of Company
Common Stock to be paid to any holder of record pursuant to this _Section
2.1(d)_ shall not exceed the Parent Trading Price.

 

Section 2.2 Election Procedures.

 

(a) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall designate and
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
paying the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Registration Statement
a form of election, and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials, in such form and containing such provisions as Parent and the
Company shall mutually agree consistent with the terms of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Form of Election_ "). The Form of Election shall
permit each Person who, at or prior to the Election Deadline, is a record
holder (or, in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner,
through proper instructions and documentation) of any share of Company Common
Stock (other than Excluded Shares) to specify the number of such holders
shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Cash
Election and/or the number of such holders shares of Company Common Stock
with respect to which such holder makes a Stock Election. The Form of
Election shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
completed Form of Election and any Certificates to the Exchange Agent. To the
extent practicable, the Form of Election will permit each holder that
beneficially owns shares of the

 



5  Company Common Stock, in more than one name or account, to specify (through
appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) how to allocate the
cash paid and shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First Step
Merger among the various accounts that such holder beneficially owns. Parent
and the Company shall mail, or cause to be mailed, with the Joint Proxy
Statement the Form of Election to all Persons who are record holders of
shares of Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Parent and the Company shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts to make, or cause to be made, the Form of Election
available to all Persons who become holders of record (or beneficial owners)
of shares of Company Common Stock during the period between the record date
for the Company Stockholders Meeting and the close of business on the last
Business Day immediately preceding the Election Deadline. As used in this
Agreement, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the last
Business Day immediately preceding the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting (after giving effect to any adjournment or postponement thereof), or
on such other date as the Parties mutually agree.

(c) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received at its designated office, by the Election Deadline,
a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by
Certificates, if any, representing the shares of Company Common Stock to
which such Form of Election relates (or customary affidavits and
indemnifications regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or by
an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set forth in such
Form of Election from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as
defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); _provided_ , that such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time set forth
in such guarantee of delivery). Holders of record of shares of Company Common
Stock who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative
capacities may submit multiple Forms of Election; _provided_ that each such
Form of Election covers all of the shares of Company Common Stock held by
each such nominee, trustee or representative for a particular beneficial
owner. Any share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) with
respect to which a proper Cash Election or Stock Election has not been made
as aforesaid shall be deemed to be a Non-Electing Company Share. After a Cash
Election or Stock Election has been validly made, any subsequent transfer of
the shares of Company Common Stock as to which such election related
shall automatically revoke such election.

(d) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated date of the
Election Deadline at least five Business Days prior to the anticipated date
of the Company Stockholders Meeting. If the Closing Date is delayed to a
subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a
subsequent date, and Parent and the Company shall promptly announce any such
delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline.

(e) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be revoked or changed with
respect to all or any portion of the shares of Company Common Stock subject
thereto (but only in whole share amounts) by the holder who submitted the
applicable Form of Election by such holder submitting to the Exchange Agent a
written notice of such revocation or change; provided such written notice is
actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline.
In addition, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article IX_
, all Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked and
Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to return all Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares submitted or transferred to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this 
_Section 2.2_. If a Cash Election or Stock Election is properly and timely
revoked or changed with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, the
Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, relating
to such revoked or changed Form of Election shall be promptly returned to the
holder or representative that submitted the same to the Exchange Agent, except
to the extent (if any) a subsequent Cash Election and/or Stock Election is
properly made with respect to any or all of the Book-Entry Shares or shares
of Company Common Stock represented by any such Certificate or Certificates.

(f) The good faith determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint good
faith determination of Parent and the Company, in the event that the Exchange
Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding
as to whether or not Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been
properly made,

 



6  revoked or changed pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ and as to when Cash
Elections, Stock Elections, revocations and changes were received by the
Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
disregard immaterial defects in the Forms of Election. Neither the Exchange
Agent, Parent nor the Company shall be under any obligation to notify any
Person of any defect in a Form of Election. The Exchange Agent (or Parent and
the Company jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make the
following computations) shall also make all computations as to the proration
contemplated by _Section 2.3_, and absent manifest error such computations
shall be conclusive and binding on Parent, the Company and all holders of
Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement of
Parent and the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any rules that are consistent with
this _Section 2.2_ for the implementation of the Cash Elections and Stock
Elections provided for in this Agreement and that shall be necessary or
desirable to effect the Cash Elections and Stock Elections.

Section 2.3 Proration. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary:

 

(a) With respect to all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
First Step Effective Time:

(i) a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to a number, rounded up
to the nearest whole number, equal to (A) (1) the Aggregate Cash
Consideration minus (2) the aggregate Equity Award Consideration payable
pursuant to this Article II, divided by (B) the Cash Consideration (such
number of shares, the " _Cash Conversion Number_ ") shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount per share equal to the Cash Consideration; and

(ii) the remainder of the shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the
Parent Common Stock Consideration per share.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Aggregate Cash Consideration_ " means an
amount equal to (x) 21,482,172 multiplied by (y) the Cash Consideration
multiplied by (z) 45%.

(b) If the aggregate number of Cash Electing Company Shares (such number of
shares, the " _Cash Election Number_ ") equals or exceeds the Cash Conversion
Number, then:

(i) all Stock Electing Company Shares and all Non-Electing Company Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Parent Common Stock
Consideration per share; and

(ii) the number of Cash Electing Company Shares of each stockholder of the
Company that shall be converted into the right to receive an amount per share
equal to the Cash Consideration shall be a number of shares, rounded up to the
nearest whole number, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
number of Cash Electing Company Shares of such stockholder by (B) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of
which is the Cash Election Number, and the remaining number of each such
holders Cash Electing Company Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Parent Common Stock Consideration per share.

 

(c) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (such
difference between the Cash Election Number and the Cash Conversion Number,
the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then:

(i) all Cash Electing Company Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount per share equal to the Cash Consideration; and

(ii) the Stock Electing Company Shares and the Non-Electing Company Shares
shall be treated in the following manner:

(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number
of Non-Electing Company Shares, then (x) all Stock Electing Company Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Parent Common Stock
Consideration per share and (y) the number of Non-Electing Company Shares of
each 

 



7  stockholder of the Company that shall be converted into the right to receive
an amount per share equal to the Cash Consideration shall be a number of
shares, rounded up to the nearest whole number, equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (1) the number of Non-Electing Company Shares of such
stockholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Non-Electing Company
Shares, and the remaining number of such holders Non-Electing Company Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Parent Common Stock
Consideration per share; or

 

(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing
Company Shares, then (x) all Non-Electing Company Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive an amount per share equal to the Cash Consideration
and (y) the number of Stock Electing Company Shares of each stockholder of the
Company that shall be converted into the right to receive an amount per share
equal to the Cash Consideration shall be a number of shares, rounded up to the
nearest whole number, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the
number of Stock Electing Company Shares of such stockholder by (2) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number
exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing Company Shares and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of Stock Electing Company Shares,
and the remaining number of such holders Stock Electing Company Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Parent Common Stock Consideration
per share.

 

Section 2.4 Effect of the First Step Merger on Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At
the First Step Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, no par value, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Step
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First Step Surviving
Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the First Step Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.5 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) As of the First Step Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock or other right to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock under any Company Equity Plan (each a " _Company Option_ "), to the
extent it is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto, shall
become fully vested as of the First Step Effective Time and shall by virtue
of the First Step Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of
any Company Option be automatically cancelled and the holder thereof will
receive, as soon as reasonably practicable following the First Step Effective
Time a cash payment (without interest) with respect thereto equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise
price per share of such Company Option and (ii) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
(collectively, the " _Option Consideration_ "). As of the First Step Effective
Time, all Company Options, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder
of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Option Consideration. The Option Consideration
shall in all cases be paid in cash and shall not be subject to the proration
contemplated by _Section 2.3_.

(b) Other than a Company RSU granted subsequent to the date of this Agreement
in accordance with _Schedule 6.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (which
shall be treated in the manner set forth in _Schedule 6.1(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule), as of the First Step Effective Time, (i) each
restricted stock unit granted under any Company Equity Plan (each a " _Company
RSU_ " and together with the Company Options, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ")
which is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall become fully vested as
of the First Step Effective Time, (ii) each Company RSU shall by virtue of the
First Step Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any
Company RSU be automatically cancelled, and the holder thereof will receive,
as soon as reasonably practicable following the First Step Effective Time, a
cash payment (without interest) with respect thereto equal to the product of
(A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU multiplied by (B) the Cash Consideration (collectively, the " _RSU
Consideration_ " and, together with the Option Consideration, the " _Equity
Award Consideration_ ") and (iii) all Company RSUs that are outstanding
immediately prior thereto, whether or not vested, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company RSU shall cease to have any rights with respect 

 



8  thereto, except the right to receive the RSU Consideration. The RSU
Consideration shall in all cases be paid in cash and shall not be subject to
the proration contemplated by  _Section 2.3_.

(c) As of the First Step Effective Time, each share of restricted stock
granted under any Company Equity Plan (each a " _Company Restricted Share_ ")
which is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall, as of the First Step
Effective Time, become fully vested and the restrictions with respect thereto
shall lapse, and shall be treated as an outstanding share of Company Common
Stock for purposes of this _Article II_.

(d) Payment of any cash amounts to be paid in respect of Company Equity
Awards or Company Restricted Shares may be made through the Surviving Entitys
payroll.

Section 2.6 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Step Effective Time that are held by any holder
who has not voted in favor of the Mergers and who is entitled, pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost, such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting
Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to
appraisal, each such share of Company Common Stock of such holder shall
thereupon be deemed to be a Non-Electing Company Share for all purposes of
this Agreement, unless such holder of Dissenting Shares shall thereafter
otherwise make a timely Stock Election or Cash Election under this Agreement.
If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to perfect or has
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to dissent from the Mergers
after the Election Deadline, each of such holders shares of Company Common
Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the First Step Effective Time, the right to receive the Parent
Common Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or a combination
thereof, as determined pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices or
demands and any other instruments received by the Company relating to rights
to appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

 

Section 2.7 Effect of the Second Step Merger on Capital Stock of the First
Step Surviving Corporation. At the Second Step Effective Time, each share of
Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First Step Surviving
Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Step
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall not be converted into
limited liability company interests or other equity interests of the
Surviving Entity. Immediately after the completion of the Second Step Merger,
Parent shall own all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company
interests or other equity interests of the Surviving Entity.

ARTICLE III

 

SURRENDER OF SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK FOR MERGER

 

CONSIDERATION

 

Section 3.1 Delivery of the Merger Consideration. Prior to the First Step
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, pursuant to an
agreement providing for the matters set forth in this _Article III_ and such
other matters as may be appropriate and the terms of which shall be mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Company, an amount in cash and shares of Parent
Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book entry form) sufficient
to effect the conversion of each share of Company Common Stock (other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) into the applicable Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. Parent agrees to make available to
the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
pursuant to  _Section 2.1(d)_ and any dividends or other distributions which
a holder of Company Common Stock has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
3.3_). All such

 



9  shares of Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The cash in the Exchange
Fund will be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent in money
market funds or similar short-term liquid investments. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose. Parent shall promptly replace or restore or
shall cause the prompt replacement or restoration of the cash in the Exchange
Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a
level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make such payments required under
this Agreement. Nothing contained in this  _Section 3.1_, and no investment
losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Exchange
Agent, shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock to
receive the Merger Consideration.

 

Section 3.2 Exchange Procedures.

 

(a) Promptly after the First Step Effective Time, but in any event not more
than five Business Days after the First Step Effective Time, Parent shall
take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Non-Electing Company Shares as of immediately prior
to the First Step Effective Time (each such holder, a " _Non-Electing
Company Holder_ "), subject to _Section 2.3_, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to each Certificate representing any Non-Electing Company Shares held by
such Non-Electing Company Holder shall pass, only upon delivery of the
completed letter of transmittal and such Certificate to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in customary form and as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree)
for return to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the total
amount of Merger Consideration that such Non-Electing Company Holder is
entitled to receive in exchange for such holders Non-Electing Company Shares
in the First Step Merger pursuant to this Agreement (including cash in lieu of
a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)_, if any). Such instructions shall be reasonable and consistent with
the provisions of this Agreement and shall be in customary form and upon
customary terms for transactions similar to the First Step Merger; _provided_
, _however_ , that prior to the First Step Effective Time, Parent shall
afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
transmittal materials and obtain the Companys approval of such materials,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, the appropriate
Merger Consideration may be paid or issued, as appropriate, to a transferee
if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. From and after the First Step Effective Time,
until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share representing Non-Electing Company Shares held by a Non-
Electing Company Holder shall be deemed to represent only the right to
receive the total amount of Merger Consideration to which such Non-Electing
Company Holder is entitled in exchange for such Non-Electing Company Shares as
contemplated by _Article II_.

 

(b) Upon surrender by a Non-Electing Company Holder to the Exchange Agent of
all Certificates representing such holders Non-Electing Company Shares,
together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, each Non-Electing Company Holder
shall be entitled to receive as promptly as reasonably practicable in
exchange therefor (and in any event within 10 Business Days following such
surrender): (i) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall
be in non-certificated book entry form), if any, into which such holders
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders properly
surrendered Non-Electing Company Shares were converted in accordance with
_Article II_ , and all Certificates representing such Non-Electing Company
Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and (ii) an amount of U.S.
dollars (after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to _Section
3.7_) equal to (A) the amount of cash (consisting of the Cash Consideration
and cash in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to be paid
pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_), if any, into which such holders shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such holders properly surrendered
Certificates were converted in accordance with _Article II_ , plus (B) any
cash dividends and other distributions that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 3.3_.

 



10 (c) As of the First Step Effective Time, each Person who immediately prior
thereto was a stockholder of the Company who properly made and did not revoke
or change a Cash Election and/or a Stock Election shall be entitled to receive
as promptly as reasonably practicable in exchange therefor (and in any event
within 10 Business Days following the First Step Effective Time): (i) the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-
certificated book entry form), if any, into which such holders shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such holders properly surrendered shares
of Company Common Stock were converted in accordance with _Article II_ , and
all Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and (ii) an amount of U.S. dollars
(after giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to _Section 3.7_)
equal to (A) the amount of cash (consisting of the Cash Consideration and cash
in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to
_Section 2.1(d)_), if any, into which such holders shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates were
converted in accordance with _Article II_ , plus (B) any cash dividends and
other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.3_.

 

Section 3.3 Dividends and Distributions. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
First Step Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
shares of Company Common Stock until such shares of Company Common Stock are
surrendered as provided in this _Article III_ or  _Section 2.2(c)_. Subject
to the effect of applicable Laws, following such surrender, there shall be
paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock (a) when any
payment or distribution of a certificate representing any share(s) of Parent
Common Stock is made to such holder pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ or _(c)_ ,
all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the First Step Effective Time and a
payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid
and (b) on the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
First Step Effective Time but prior to surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends and other
distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to the First Step Merger shall be entitled to
dividends and other distributions on or in respect of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding
as of the First Step Effective Time.

Section 3.4 Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. From and
after the First Step Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. After the First
Step Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and such dividends and other distributions on or
in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor as
provided herein or as otherwise provided by applicable Law. If, after the
First Step Effective Time, any shares of Company Common Stock are presented to
the Exchange Agent, the First Step Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
_Article II_.

 

Section 3.5 Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following 12 months
after the First Step Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent (a) shares of Parent Common Stock held by
the Exchange Agent for payment of the Parent Common Stock Consideration and
(b) cash held by the Exchange Agent for payment of Cash Consideration and
cash payments in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, in each
case, for which the Exchange Agent shall not have been obligated to deliver to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to  _Section 3.2_.
Thereafter, holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to
look only to Parent, which shall thereafter act as the Exchange Agent (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
of Parent with respect to the delivery of the Merger Consideration (including
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) upon due
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by such holders. None
of Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law from and after the date that any such Law shall become applicable
to the Merger Consideration.

 



11 Section 3.6 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit attesting to that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent, the delivery by such
Person of a bond (in such amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Exchange Agent, Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Entity on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled as determined and otherwise in accordance with _Article II_ ,
together with any cash dividends and other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3_.

 

Section 3.7 Withholding Taxes. Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of
Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold and remit to
the appropriate Tax authority with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by
Parent or the Exchange Agent and paid over on a timely basis to the
appropriate Tax authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company
Common Stock or Company Equity Awards in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. Any applicable Tax
withholdings with respect to the consideration payable in respect of a Company
Restricted Share first shall reduce the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, payable in respect of such Company Restricted Share.

Section 3.8 Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, in the event that (a) the Company changes the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding or (b) Parent changes the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding, in each
case following the Capitalization Date but prior to the First Step Effective
Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision,
issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration and the Equity Award Consideration shall be equitably adjusted
to reflect such change.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in (a) the disclosure schedule of the Company delivered to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), with
specific reference to the Section of this Agreement to which the information
stated in such Company Disclosure Schedule relates, or another Section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
Section of this Agreement or (b) the Company SEC Reports publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding (x) any disclosures set forth
in any section of any such filings entitled "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking
Statements" or "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" or
any other disclosures contained or referenced therein regarding information,
factors or risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature
and (y) any exhibits or other documents appended thereto or incorporated by
reference therein), it being understood that any matter disclosed in any such
filings shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of this _Article IV_ only
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure in
such filing that such disclosure is applicable to a Section of this _Article
IV_ (other than, in each case, any matters required to be disclosed for
purposes of _Section 4.3_ (Capitalization), which matters shall be
specifically disclosed in _Section 4.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule),
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent, Merger Sub and Successor
Sub as follows:

Section 4.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own,
operate or lease and to carry on

 



12  its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and has the requisite
corporate, limited liability company or similar organizational power and
authority to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate
or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to be in good standing or to have such power or authority
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to
be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. A true and complete list of all of the
Companys Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of organization of each
Subsidiary and the percentage of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock
or ownership interests owned by the Company or another Subsidiary, is set
forth in _Section 4.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as set
forth in _Section 4.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does
not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or
similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business association or entity, excluding securities in any publicly traded
company held for investment and comprising less than 2% of the outstanding
stock of such company.

 

Section 4.2 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

 

(a) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as amended to date. Such
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws are in full force and effect. The
Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws.

 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or equivalent organizational
documents) of each of the Material Company Subsidiaries, each as amended to
date (the " _Subsidiary Documents_ "). Such Subsidiary Documents are in full
force and effect. No Material Company Subsidiary is in material violation of
any of the provisions of its Subsidiary Documents.

Section 4.3 Capitalization.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists exclusively of (i)
50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, none of which Preferred Stock is
issued, outstanding or reserved for issuance as of the date of this Agreement.
As of May 1, 2015 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "), (i) 21,196,006 shares of
Company Common Stock (inclusive of Company Restricted Shares) were issued and
outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
and no such shares of Company Common Stock were held in treasury, (ii) no
shares of Company Common Stock were held by Subsidiaries of the Company, and
(iii) 286,166 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance
pursuant to outstanding Company Options or Company RSUs granted under the
Company incentive plans and agreements listed in _Section 4.3(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Equity Plans_ "), and 842,428
shares of Company Common Stock remained available for future issuance under
the Company Equity Plans. Since the Capitalization Date through the date of
this Agreement, the Company has not issued any shares of its capital stock,
voting securities or equity interests, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock, voting
securities or equity interests, other than pursuant to the outstanding Company
Options, Company RSUs and other rights referred to above in this _Section
4.3(a)_. Except as set forth in this _Section 4.3_ or _Section 4.3(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, and other than Company Equity Awards or
Company Restricted Shares issued in accordance with _Schedule 6.1(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no options, warrants, convertible
securities or other similar rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of
any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the 

 



13  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All shares of Company
Common Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
Except as disclosed in _Section 4.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
for intercompany receivables and payables made in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, there are no obligations, contingent
or otherwise, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or the capital stock
or other equity interests of any Subsidiary or to provide funds to or make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in
any such Subsidiary or any other entity. There are no outstanding preemptive
rights with respect to the Company Common Stock. All of the outstanding shares
of capital stock or other equity interests of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and all such shares or other equity interests are owned by the
Company or another Subsidiary of the Company free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in the Companys
voting rights, charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

 

(b) Except for Company Equity Awards or Company Restricted Shares issued in
accordance with _Schedule 6.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
only shares of capital stock or warrants, options, convertible securities,
exchangeable securities or other rights to acquire capital stock of the
Company (or rights or benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of
capital stock of the Company) that shall be issued or outstanding shall be
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company RSUs representing
in the aggregate not more than 21,482,172 Fully Diluted Share Equivalents. As
used in this Agreement, " _Fully Diluted Share Equivalents_ " means, at any
time, the sum of (i) the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock plus (ii) a number of shares of Company Common Stock equivalent
to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate Equity Award
Consideration by (B) the Cash Consideration.

Section 4.4 Authority Relative to this Agreement. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholders Approval, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than receipt of the Company Stockholders Approval
and the filing of the First Step Certificate of Merger). This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent,
Merger Sub and Successor Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with

Company.

Section 4.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

 

(a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and other documents (including
exhibits and all other information incorporated by reference) required to be
filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
") since June 30, 2012, including (i) its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2012, June 29, 2013 and June 28, 2014, (ii) all
proxy statements relating to the Companys meetings of stockholders (whether

registration statements filed by the Company with the SEC since June 30,
2012, and (iv) all amendments and supplements to the foregoing filed by the
Company with the SEC since June 30, 2012 (collectively, the " _Company
SEC Reports_ "). The Company SEC Reports (A) were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not at the time they were filed
(or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they

 



15  were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC
Reports. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Reports is
subject to ongoing SEC review. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is required
to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC, other than as part
of Companys consolidated group. The Company is and has been since June 30,
2012 in compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in or incorporated by reference into the
Company SEC Reports at the time filed complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto as of their respective dates and was prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and each fairly presents in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements included
therein were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments as
permitted by GAAP. The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements and reflect only actual transactions. As of the date of this
Agreement, Grant Thornton LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of the Company as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with the Company on a matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(c) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information
(both financial and non-financial) relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer
and the principal financial officer of the Company required by Section 302 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _Sarbanes-Oxley_ ") with respect to such
reports. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
Sarbanes-Oxley.

(d) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act). Such internal controls are designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and
the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP. Since June 30, 2012 through the date of this
Agreement, the Company has disclosed to the Companys auditors and audit
committee, to the extent required by Sarbanes-Oxley or the Exchange Act, and
based upon the most recent evaluation of the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, (i) any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in a material respect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal controls over financial
reporting. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such
disclosure regarding material weaknesses and fraud made by management to the
Companys auditors and audit committee from June 30, 2012 through the date of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "significant deficiency" in
controls means an internal control deficiency that adversely affects an
entitys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external
financial data reliably in accordance with GAAP. A "significant deficiency"
may be a single deficiency or a combination of deficiencies that results
in more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented
or detected. For purposes of this Agreement, a "material weakness" in internal
controls means a significant

 



16  deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that results in
more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

Section 4.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in

of Parent pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)_, _(b)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)(i)_ , _(e)(ii)_

event occurred after the date of this Agreement.

Subsidiaries has any liabilities (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due), except liabilities (a) disclosed
in the Companys audited balance sheet (including any related notes thereto)
as of June 28, 2014 included in the Company SEC Reports filed and publicly

Sheet_ "), (b) incurred since June 28, 2014 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (c) reasonably incurred in connection with the

compliance with or to have such Company Employee Plan in documentary
compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the
final regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively, "
_Section 409A_ "), which such failures would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
With respect to each such Company Employee Plan that is not intended to be
subject to Section 409A because it is not a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan under Section 409A and the regulations thereunder
or is otherwise exempt from its application, all the conditions required to
retain such treatment remain in effect and are not reasonably expected to
change so as to subject such Company Employee Plan to Section 409A. None of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (x) have failed to report to any Governmental
Authority any corrections made or Taxes due as a result of a failure to comply
with Section 409A, which such failure would reasonably be expected to result

such Non-U.S. Company Employee Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in material compliance with its terms and all applicable Laws;
(ii) to the extent required to be funded such Non-U.S. Company Employee Plan

(g) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of
its affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or
termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or Company Employee Plan
currently in effect would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment"
(as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND SUCCESSOR SUB

 

Except as set forth in (a) the disclosure schedule of Parent delivered to the
Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), with
specific reference to the Section of this Agreement to which the information
stated in such Parent Disclosure Schedule relates, or another Section of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
Section of this Agreement or (b) the Parent SEC Reports publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding (x) any disclosures set forth
in any section of any such filings entitled "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking
Statements" or "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" or
any other disclosures contained or referenced therein regarding information,
factors or risks that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature
and (y) any exhibits or other documents appended thereto or incorporated by
reference therein), it being understood that any matter disclosed in any such
filings shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of this _Article V_ only
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure in
such filing that such disclosure is applicable to a Section of this _Article
V_ (other than, in each case, any matters required to be disclosed for
purposes of _Section 5.3_ (Capitalization), which matters shall be
specifically disclosed in _Section 5.3_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule),
Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub hereby jointly and severally represent
and warrant to the Company as follows:

 

Section 5.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub is a corporation or limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate or limited
liability company power and authority to own, lease and operate the properties
it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Each of Merger Sub and Successor Sub was formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, has not engaged in any business activities or conducted any
operations other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and will have no assets, liabilities or obligations other than
those contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Each of Parents other Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
that concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and has
the requisite corporate, limited liability company or similar organizational
power and authority to own, lease and operate the properties it purports
to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing or to have such
power and authority would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries, including each of Merger Sub and Successor Sub, is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its

 



30  properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to
be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. A true and complete list of all of Parents
Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of organization of
each Subsidiary and the percentage of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital
stock or ownership interests owned by Parent or another Subsidiary, is set
forth in _Section 5.1_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth
in  _Section 5.1_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent does not
directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business
association or entity, excluding securities in any publicly traded company
held for investment and comprising less than 2% of the outstanding stock of
such company.

 

Section 5.2 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

 

(a) Parent has made available to the Company complete and correct copies of
its and Merger Subs respective Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and
Successor Subs Subsidiary Documents, each as amended to date. Such

such Parent Subsidiary is in material violation of any of the provisions of
its Subsidiary Documents.

Section 5.3 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists
exclusively of (a) 100,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and (b) 10,000
shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, none of which Preferred

Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable, 82,200 shares of which were held in

exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock, voting
securities or equity interests, other than pursuant to the outstanding
stock options, shares of restricted stock and other rights referred to above
in this _Section 5.3(a)_. Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3_ or
_Section 5.3_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and other than employee
and director stock options, shares of restricted stock or other similar
rights issued pursuant to the stockholder approved plans identified on
_Section 5.3_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no options,
warrants, convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. All
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance
on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to
which they are issuable, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. Except as disclosed in _Section 5.3_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, there are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of

nonassessable, and all such shares or other equity interests are owned by
Parent or another Subsidiary of Parent free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in Parents voting
rights, charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. All the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub are, and as of
the First Step Effective Time will be, owned of record and beneficially by

or other equity interests of Successor Sub are, and as of the Second Step
Effective Time will be, owned of record and beneficially by Parent.

terms redacted (none of which redacted provisions will adversely affect
the availability of, or impose conditions on, the availability of the Debt
Financing at the Closing)), together with all annexes, exhibits, schedules and
attachments thereto and each such fee letter, in each case, as amended or
otherwise modified only to the extent permitted by this Agreement,
collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Financing Sources have
committed to lend the aggregate principal amounts set forth therein on the
terms set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of financing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ ").

the commitments and obligations set forth therein) is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or

The Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered to the Company, is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent
as of the date of this Agreement, the other party or parties thereto, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. There are no side letters or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements (except for customary fee letters and

and Successor Sub, on the one hand, and the provider or providers of the Debt
Financing, on the other hand, in each case, that have been provided to the

amendment, restatement, withdrawal, termination or other modification of the

event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,

condition, of the Debt Commitment Letter or that would permit the Financing
Sources party thereto to terminate, or to not make the initial funding of the
Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing upon satisfaction of all conditions
thereto set forth in, in each case, the Debt Commitment Letter. Except as set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, there are no: (i) conditions precedent to
the respective obligations of the Financing Sources specified in the Debt
Commitment Letter to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing at or prior

letters or arrangements relating to the Debt Financing to which any of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party that would permit
the Financing Sources specified in the Debt Commitment Letter to reduce the
total amount of the Debt Financing, or that would materially and adversely
affect the availability to Parent of the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe
that any of the conditions precedent to the closing of the Debt Financing will
not be satisfied, or that the Debt Financing will not be made available to the
Parent, in each case, at or prior to the Closing. Parent has fully paid, or
caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment and other fees required by the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date
of this Agreement.

 

(c) Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub will have, as of the time of the
satisfaction of the conditions to effect the First Step Merger under 
_Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.3_ (or as of the time that the conditions to

have been satisfied, if not primarily for the lack of the Financing or any
action or inaction by Parent, Merger Sub or Successor Sub done in bad faith),
sufficient funds (and the net cash proceeds of the Debt Financing, together
with cash and cash equivalents available to Parent, will be sufficient)

all other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) to pay all fees,

Section 6.2 Go-Shop; No Solicitation.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, from
the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m. New York City time
on the date which is 45 Business Days after the date of this Agreement (the "
_Go-Shop Period End Date_ "), the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and its

bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives
retained by the Company or its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Representatives_
") shall have the right to directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit and
encourage any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party
indication of interest in, any Competing Proposal from one or more Persons,
including by way of contacting third parties or public disclosure and by way

to the business, properties, assets, books, records and personal of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, to any Person (each, a " _Solicited Person_
") pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less
favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provide to
Parent all non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
delivered or made available to any Solicited Person to the extent such
materials and information were not previously furnished or made available to
Parent; and (ii) enter into and participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding, and take any other action to encourage or facilitate any inquiries
or the making of any offer or proposal that constitutes or would be reasonably
likely to lead to, a Competing Proposal. Within one Business Day following
the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the
material terms and conditions of any Competing Proposal (including any
amendments or modifications thereof) received from any Excluded Party (as
defined below) and the identity thereof.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.2_, at 12:01 a.m. New
York City time, on the day immediately following the Go-Shop Period End Date,
the Company shall (i) immediately cease any activities permitted by _Section

Affiliates) that are ongoing as of the Go-Shop Period End Date and that relate
to a possible Competing Proposal, and (ii) terminate access to any physical or
electronic data rooms relating to a possible Competing Proposal.

(c) Except as expressly contemplated by _Section 6.2_, from and after the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Article IX_ or the Closing, the Company shall not, and
the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly through any Person, (i) solicit, initiate,
facilitate or respond to, including by way of furnishing non-public

that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Proposal; _provided_ that, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
the Company may respond to an unsolicited inquiry or proposal by informing the

any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, term sheet, agreement in

resolve to recommend or approve any Competing Proposal; (iv) release any third
party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or "standstill" or

45 (d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.2(c)_, if at any
time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholders Approval, the Company (or any of the Company
Representatives) receives a Competing Proposal (in circumstances not involving
a material breach of, or any action that is inconsistent with, this _Section
6.2_) that constitutes or the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
believes could be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company
may (i) furnish non-public information to the third party making such
Competing Proposal, if and only if, (A) prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company and such third party execute a confidentiality
agreement that contains confidentiality and standstill provisions that are no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and that does not contain any provision calling for any exclusive
right to negotiate with such Person or prohibiting the Company
from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement, and (B) the Company
provides to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to any such third party (or
its representatives) which had not previously been provided or made available
to Parent within 48 hours after the Company provides or makes such non-public
information available to such third party; and (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such third party with respect to the Competing Proposal;
_provided_ that within 48 hours following the Company taking such actions as
described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company shall provide written
notice to Parent of such Competing Proposal; _provided further_ that (x) such
notice to Parent shall identify the Person making, and indicate in reasonable
detail the terms and conditions of, such Competing Proposal, and (y)
thereafter, the Company shall provide to Parent, within 48 hours, copies of
any proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreements received in connection with
such Competing Proposal (including any material amendments or modifications
thereto). Promptly upon Parents written request (which may be made via
e-mail), the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
details of any Competing Proposal.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, after the Go-Shop Period End Date until the
receipt of the Company Stockholders Approval at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the Company may continue to take any of the actions described in
_Section 6.2(d)_ (subject to the limitations and obligations set forth
herein) with respect to any bona fide written proposals or offers
regarding any Competing Proposal submitted by a Solicited Person on or before
the Go-Shop Period End Date if the Board of Directors of the Company believes
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal (each such Solicited Person, an " _Excluded Party_ "); _provided_ ,
that an Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party if such Person
shall have delivered to the Company written notice that it is no longer
contemplating consummating a Competing Proposal.

(f) Except as expressly contemplated by  _Sections 6.2(g)-(h)_ below, from
and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ or the Closing, neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw (or change, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent,
Merger Sub or Successor Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or change,
amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent, Merger Sub or
Successor Sub), the Company Board Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend, a Competing Proposal; or (iii)
publicly make any communication inconsistent with the Company
Board Recommendation (any action described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)
being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholders Approval, if the Company receives a Competing Proposal (in
circumstances not involving a material breach of, or any action that is
materially inconsistent with, this _Section 6.2_) that the Board of Directors
of the Company concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal:

(A) effect a Change of Recommendation; and/or

 

(B) terminate this Agreement;

 



46 _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may not
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the foregoing clause (B) except
in connection with entering into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of Directors of the
Company may not effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing
clause (A) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B)
unless:

 

(x) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
24 hours in advance of such Change of Recommendation or such termination (the
" _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation in
response to such Superior Proposal, or to terminate this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement for such Superior Proposal, pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(g)_, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal);

 

(y) the Company and the Company Representatives shall have negotiated with
Parent in good faith during the Notice Period to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Competing Proposal ceases
to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

(z) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect such
Change of Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal, or to
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement for such
Superior Proposal, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under the
DGCL (after taking into consideration any adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement definitively offered by Parent pursuant to the
foregoing clause (y)). Each time the financial or other material terms of a
Superior Proposal subject to this clause (h) are amended, the Company shall
be required to notify Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of such
amended terms and conditions, and the Notice Period shall be extended an
additional one Business Day from the date of Parents receipt of such
information.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Competing Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal, offer or indication
of interest made by a third party, from the date of this Agreement through
the date on which the Company obtains the Company Stockholders Approval,
relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more (by
value) of the assets, net revenues, or net income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of the combined voting power of
the shares of Company Common Stock, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of
the combined voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock or any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in which the other party thereto or its stockholders would own
20% or more of the combined voting power of the parent entity resulting from
any such transaction, other than transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a Competing Proposal not solicited or
initiated in material breach of  _Section 6.2(a)_ or _(b)_ that the Board
of Directors of the Company in good faith determines would, if consummated,
result in a transaction that is (A) more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated hereby, after taking into account any changes to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement definitely offered by Parent during the Notice
Period and (B) reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed,
taking into account all financial aspects and conditions to closing;
_provided_ that, for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the
references to "20% or more" in the definition of Competing Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "50% or more".

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Board of Directors of the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii)
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Competing Proposal
or (iii) making any disclosure to its stockholders where the failure to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the

 



47  Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under the
DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any such disclosure relating to a
Competing Proposal (other than a "stop, look and listen communication" of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) or a disclosure which expresses no view of
the Competing Proposal except that it is pending further consideration by the
Company) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation, unless the Board
of Directors of the Company expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in connection with such disclosure; and (B) nothing in this
_Section 6.2(i)_ shall be deemed to permit the Company or the Board of
Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) to make a Change of
Recommendation, except to the extent and under the circumstances permitted by
_Section 6.2(g)_.

 

Section 6.3 Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the First Step Merger.
Parent covenants and agrees that, except as expressly contemplated or
required by this Agreement, or required by Law, during the period from the
date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall, in all material
respects, conduct its business and shall cause the businesses of its
Subsidiaries to be conducted only in, and Parent and its Subsidiaries shall

the present relationships of Parent and its Subsidiaries with customers,
suppliers and other Persons with which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
material business relations, and Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not take
any actions which would reasonably be expected to materially interfere with or
delay the consummation of the Mergers or otherwise breach this Agreement. By

Subsidiaries shall, during the period from the date of this Agreement and

material change, restructuring or reorganization with respect to, Parent
Common Stock, including payment of any dividend or other distribution in

consistent with past practice or dividends and distributions by Parents
Subsidiaries to Parent or any of their wholly owned Subsidiaries
respectively);

 

(c) issue, sell, pledge, dispose of or encumber, or authorize the issuance,

GAAP;

 

(e) acquire (by merger, consolidation, or acquisition of stock or assets) any

(other than purchases of supplies and inventories in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice or any transaction solely between

Subsidiaries of Parent), other than any of the forgoing that would not
reasonably be expected to delay or make it more difficult to obtain any
authorization, consent or approval required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay or impeded the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(f) enter into or adopt a plan or agreement of complete or partial
liquidation, dissolution, restructuring, recapitalization,

Parent from performing or cause Parent not to perform its covenants hereunder.

 

Section 6.4 Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent. Unless the
Company shall have effected a Change of Recommendation, the Board of
Directors of Parent shall recommend the approval of the Share Issuance in the

any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or

Closing, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, employees, auditors, counsel and
agents to afford the officers, employees, auditors, counsel and agents of the
other Party reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable
advance notice, to its and its Subsidiaries officers, employees, auditors,
agents, properties, offices and other facilities and to all of their
respective books and records, and shall promptly make available to the other
Party all financial, operating and other data and information (except for
documents or information relating to the disclosing Partys consideration,
evaluation, assessment and/or negotiation of this Agreement or the Mergers or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or, in the case of the
Company, any Competing Proposal or Superior Proposal (except as otherwise
required pursuant to _Section 6.2_)) as the other Party may reasonably
request and as will not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in any material respect. From time to time as
reasonably requested by Parent or the Company, Parent and the Company
will consult with the Chief Executive Officer and/or the Chief Financial
Officer of the other Party regarding the scope of access to information
contemplated by this _Section 7.5_, and the Parties will agree on the 

 



51  appropriate level of detail and scope of access required by and consistent
with this _Section 7.5_. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.5(a)_
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by
the Company herein or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties hereto
under this Agreement, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to
Parent, Merger Sub or Successor Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Parent and the Company agree that all information provided pursuant to
this _Section 7.5_ shall be deemed received pursuant to the Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement dated as of November 6, 2013 between Peerless Mfg.
Co., a subsidiary of the Company, and Parent (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

 

Section 7.6 Public Announcements.

 

(a) The initial press release with respect to the Mergers, this Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, none of the
Parties shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Mergers, this Agreement
or the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the
other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), subject to  _Section 6.2_ hereof and as may be contemplated by
other provisions of this Agreement and also except as may be required by Law
or by any applicable listing agreement with NASDAQ, as applicable, as
determined in the good faith judgment of the Party proposing to make such
release (in which case such Party shall not issue or cause the publication of
such press release or other public announcement without prior consultation
with the other Party).

 

(b) Reasonably in advance of each of the Companys quarterly earnings releases
or announcements during the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_
or the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent with proposed drafts of all
Company SEC filings, press releases, conference call scripts and similar
materials, in each case to the extent relating to earnings releases or
announcements.

Section 7.7 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall cooperate with the other Party and use (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things,
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to
be satisfied as promptly as commercially practicable and to consummate and
make effective, as promptly as commercially practicable, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents, and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or
third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, each of the Parties shall (i) make all appropriate filings
and submissions under the HSR Act and with any other Governmental Authority
pursuant to any other applicable Antitrust Laws or otherwise, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable the
termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign
Antitrust Laws.

 

(b) Each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to such
transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii)
keep the other Parties reasonably informed in all material respects and on a
reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such Party
from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental Authority and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private

 



52  party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of
the Parties shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
the other Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections,
if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with
respect to the Mergers, the Share Issuance or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In the event that any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding is initiated (or threatened to be initiated) by a Governmental
Authority challenging the Mergers, the Share Issuance or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other and to vigorously
contest and resist any such action or proceeding until the entering into by a
court of competent jurisdiction of a permanent injunction or other order that
permanently prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the Mergers,
the Share Issuance or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor Parent shall, without the other partys prior written
consent, commit to any divestiture transaction or agree to any restriction on
its business, and nothing in this _Section 7.7_ shall (i) limit any
applicable rights a Party may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Article IX_ so long as such Party has up to then complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this _Section 7.7_ or (ii) require the
Parties to offer, accept or agree to (A) dispose or hold separate any part of
either of their businesses, operations, assets or product lines (or a
combination of Parents and the Companys respective businesses, operations,
assets or product lines), (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of
business, or (C) restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the
Company, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or any of
their Affiliates may carry on business in any part of the world;  _provided_
, _however_ , that the Parties shall be required to take (and to cause their
Subsidiaries to take) the actions set forth in clauses (ii)(A) through (ii)(C)
of this _Section 7.7(d)_ if, but only if, such actions, considered
collectively, would not reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect
the business or operations of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

Section 7.8 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

 

(a) As of the First Step Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) cause the
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation provisions contained
in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the First Step Surviving
Corporation and the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving
Entity to be at least as favorable to individuals who are now, or have been at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who become prior to the
Closing Date, a director, officer, agent or employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise entitled to compulsory indemnification under the
Companys or such Subsidiarys Bylaws or Certificate of Incorporation or
Subsidiary Documents (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), as those contained as of
the date of this Agreement in the Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation or
Subsidiary Documents of the Company or such Subsidiary, respectively, (ii)
not allow any amendment, modification or repeal of (A) any such provision in
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the First Step Surviving
Corporation or the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving
Entity or (B) any indemnification contracts or other agreements between the
Company and any Indemnified Party set forth or otherwise described on _Section
7.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (iii) shall cause such
provisions and all such indemnification contracts or other agreements to be
fully observed and complied with in all material respect for a period of six
years from and after the Closing Date.

 

(b) For six years from and after the First Step Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent, the First Step Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Entity (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party who was a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the First
Step Effective Time against all losses, claims,

 



53  damages, liabilities, fees and actual expenses, amounts paid in settlement,
judgments and fines that may be imposed upon or incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
threatened or initiated by reason of any actions or omissions in their
capacity as a director or officer occurring at or prior to the First Step
Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), unless the action or omission giving rise to the claim for
indemnification is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
constituted willful misconduct or recklessness. In addition, the Indemnifying
Parties shall advance all expenses actually incurred by each such Indemnified
Party who is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the First Step Effective Time for any legal or
other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, out-of-pocket expenses, judgments and fines within 10 days
after the receipt by Parent of a statement or statements from such Indemnified
Party requesting such advance or advances from time to time, subject to
Parents receipt of a written undertaking by such Indemnified Party to
promptly repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is
ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified hereunder or under applicable Law.

(c) In addition to the Indemnifying Parties indemnification obligations
pursuant to this _Section 7.8_, prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall purchase a "tail" officers and directors liability insurance policy,
which by its terms shall survive the Mergers and shall provide each
Indemnified Party who was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the First Step Effective Time with coverage for
not less than six years following the Effective Time on terms and conditions
no less favorable than the terms of the directors and officers liability
insurance policy currently maintained by the Company in respect of actions or
omissions of such officers and directors prior to the First Step Effective
Time in their capacities as such;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company expend more than 250% of the current annual premium paid by
the Company for such policy to purchase the "tail" policy (the " _Maximum
Amount_ "); provided, further, however, that if the amount of the annual
premiums necessary to procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum
Amount, the Company shall spend up to the Maximum Amount to purchase such
lesser coverage as may be obtained with such Maximum Amount.

(d) This _Section 7.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and
continue in full force and effect and, from and after the First Step
Effective Time, is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party as a third-party beneficiary. During the periods set forth
in this _Section 7.8_, Parent shall guarantee the obligations of the other
Indemnifying Parties with respect to any and all amounts payable under this
_Section 7.8._

(e) In the event that the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
(including pursuant to the Second Step Merger) or (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or
Parent or the acquirer of the properties and assets thereof, as the case may
be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.8_.

 

(f) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, contract or otherwise.

Section 7.9 Employee Matters.

 

(a) From and after the First Step Effective Time, Parent shall cause the First
Step Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, and its
Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, (i) all employment
agreements and change in control agreements listed on _Section 7.9_ of the
Company

 



54  Disclosure Schedule, except in the event the individuals covered under such
agreements enter into new agreements with Parent that supersede or change the
terms of such employment agreements and change-in control agreements listed
on _Section 7.9(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) for a period
of six months following the First Step Effective Time, the Companys severance
policy described on  _Section 7.9(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and (iii) for the duration of each such agreement, those severance agreements
listed on _Section 7.9(a)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) Employees shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits, but excluding
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or equity-based plans,
under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or
maintained by Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Entity under which the employee may be eligible to participate on or after
the First Step Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such employees under comparable
Company Employee Plans and Non-U.S. Company Employee Plans immediately prior
to the First Step Effective Time, but which shall not result in the
duplication of benefits thereunder.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any present or former employees or directors,
consultants or independent contractors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the First
Step Effective Time, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity or any of their Subsidiaries), other than the Parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section
7.9_) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained
in this _Section 7.9_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment to any Company
Employee Plan, Non-U.S. Company Employee Plan or Parent Employee Plan, or (ii)
obligate Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or
any of their Affiliates to retain the employment of any particular employee
or, maintain any particular plan, contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding or prevent Parent, the First Step Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates from amending or modifying any
particular plan, contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

 

Section 7.10 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts
to obtain, prior to the First Step Effective Time, the approval for listing
on NASDAQ, effective upon official notice of issuance, of the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued at the First Step Effective Time pursuant to
_Articles II_ and _III_.

 

Section 7.11 No Shelf Registration. Parent shall not be required to amend or
maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for the purpose of
permitting resale of the shares of Parent Common Stock received pursuant
hereto by the Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company or
Parent within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act.

Section 7.12 Qualification as Reorganization for U.S. Federal Income Tax
Purposes.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each Party hereto shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify as a reorganization under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, and shall not, without the prior
written consent of the other Parties to this Agreement, intentionally take any
actions, intentionally cause any actions to be taken or intentionally omit
to take any action which such action or omission could prevent the Mergers
from qualifying as such a reorganization.

(b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain on or about the Closing Date the opinion of Jones
Day, counsel to the Company, and the opinion of Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP,
counsel to Parent (each such counsel, " _Tax Counsel_ "), each such opinion
dated as of the Closing Date, substantially to the effect that, on the basis
of the facts, representations and assumptions set forth

 



55  in such opinion, (i) the Mergers will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) the Company and Parent each
will be a "party to the reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b)
of the Code.

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for inclusion in the Registration
Statement and any amendment thereto, an opinion from each Tax Counsel, in such
form as each Tax Counsel may deem appropriate, as to the tax consequences of
the contemplated Mergers as may be required by the SEC in connection with the
filing of such Registration Statement or any amendment thereto.

 

(d) Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub and the Company shall each provide
reasonable cooperation to each Tax Counsel in connection with Tax Counsels
rendering of its opinions pursuant to _Sections 7.12(b)_ and _7.12(c)_ , which
shall include the provision of officers certificates setting forth such
representations, covenants, data and such other information as may be
reasonably requested by such Tax Counsel including, but not limited to, such
information as may be necessary or appropriate to make a reasonable assessment
as to compliance with the continuity of interest requirement under Section
368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
Neither Company nor Parent presently knows of any reason why the Company or
Parent, as applicable, will not be able to deliver such certificates.

 

(e) If the tax opinion of both of the Tax Counsel referred to in _Section
7.12(b) _is obtained, then each of the Parties shall report the Mergers for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. However, for the avoidance of doubt, obtaining the
tax opinions of either or both of the Tax Counsel referred to in _Section
7.12(b)_ shall not be a condition to any Partys obligation to consummate the
Mergers or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 7.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the First Step Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such reasonable steps as may be required (to the
extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards (including derivative securities
with respect to such shares) that are treated as dispositions under Rule
16b-(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act and resulting from the transactions
contemplated by _Article II_ by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-(3) promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

Section 7.14 Financing.

 

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub acknowledge and agree that (i) the
Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective representatives shall
not, prior to the First Step Effective Time, incur any liability to any Person
under any financing (including the Debt Financing) that Parent, Merger Sub,
Successor Sub or any of their Affiliates may raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided
pursuant to this _Section 7.14_, _Section 7.15_ or otherwise and (ii)
Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates and its and
their respective stockholders, members, partners and other Company
Representatives from and against any losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them at any time in connection with
the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, the Financing,
any information utilized in connection therewith and any cooperation provided
pursuant to this _Section 7.14_,  _Section 7.15_ or otherwise.

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including: (i)
maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter (including any definitive
agreement entered into in connection therewith), (ii) negotiating and entering
into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment

 



56  Letter as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement; (iii)
satisfying, or causing their representatives to satisfy, when required by the
Debt Commitment Letter all conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub,
Successor Sub or their respective representatives to obtaining the Debt
Financing; (iv) complying with their respective affirmative and negative
covenants set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter; and (v) fully enforcing
their respective rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, including causing
the Financing Sources providing the Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing
at the Closing in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(c) None of Parent, Merger Sub or Successor Sub may agree to any amendments or
modifications to or replacements of, or grant any waivers of, any condition
or other provision or remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter without the
prior written consent of the Company, which may be unreasonably refused if
such amendments, modifications or waivers would (i) materially reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing as provided in the Debt Commitment
Letter as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) impose new or additional
conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, in each case,
to the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, at or prior to
the closing of the Debt Financing, or (iii) in any material respect adversely
delay or impact the ability of Parent to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may
amend or modify the Debt Commitment Letter without the consent of the Company
to add or change any immaterial term of the Debt Commitment Letter, add or
replace lenders, lead arrangers, syndication agents or similar entities that
had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement
so long as such addition, replacement or change is not reasonably expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, (i) delay or prevent the Closing or (ii)
make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing) at or prior to Closing less likely to occur.
Parent shall not release or consent to the termination of the obligations of
the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter, except for assignments
and replacements of an individual lender in accordance with this  _Section
7.14_. The parties to the Debt Commitment Letter (other than Parent, Merger
Sub, Successor Sub and their respective Affiliates) and any additional or
replacement lenders thereunder permitted hereby are referred to in
this Agreement collectively as the " _Financing Sources_." The Financing
Sources, together with each of their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys and other representatives,
are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the " _Financing Source
Related Parties_." As of the date of this Agreement, the only Financing
Sources are Bank of America, N.A.

 

(d) In the event that the Debt Commitment Letter expires or terminates for any
reason or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes reasonably likely to be
unavailable on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the Financing
Sources, in each case, contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) Parent
shall within two days thereof so notify the Company in writing and (ii) as
promptly as practicable following any such event (and in no event later than
the Closing Date), Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from
alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the Required Amount, in
each case, with conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a whole,
to Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub and the Company than the conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including a commitment termination date
not earlier than the Drop Dead Date) (the " _Alternate Financing_ "). The
definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section 7.14(d)_ or _Section 7.14(b)(ii)_ are referred to in this
Agreement, collectively, as the " _Financing Agreements_." The term " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " will be deemed to include any commitment letters,
together with all annexes, exhibits, schedules and attachments thereto, and
all term sheets, engagement letters and fee letters related thereto, in each
case, with respect to the Alternate Financing. Parent shall accept any such
commitment letters for the Alternate Financing if the funding conditions and
other terms and conditions contained therein are not materially adverse to
Parent in comparison with those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(e) Parent shall (i) promptly furnish to the Company complete, correct and
executed copies of the Financing Agreements and copies of any and all
material written documentation pertaining to the availability of

 



57  the Debt Financing (or any Alternate Financing), (ii) give the Company
written notice within two days of any withdrawal, termination, amendment,
supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter, of any
developments, facts or circumstances that reasonably could be concluded to
result in the inability of Parent to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of the Debt Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by Parent,
or of any material breach or material threatened breach by any party of any of
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements of which Parent, Merger
Sub or Successor Sub becomes aware or any termination thereof, and (iii)
otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing (or any Alternate Financing).

 

Section 7.15 Financing Cooperation.

 

(a) Prior to the First Step Effective Time, the Company shall and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to cooperate, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its officers, employees, representatives, auditors and
advisors, including legal and accounting advisors, to cooperate, in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any debt payoff and/or any
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of existing indebtedness of the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as may be reasonably
requested by Parent and as will not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in any material respect,
including: (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations, due diligence sessions, and "road show"
and other customary marketing presentations; (ii) making available to any
Financing Sources as promptly as practicable pertinent information in writing
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Debt Financing; (iii) assisting with the
preparation by Parent or the Financing Sources of (A) one or more customary
offering documents, information memoranda and/or documents in connection with
the Debt Financing and (B) materials for rating agency presentations; (iv)
executing and delivering customary pledge and security documents or other
financing documents, a certificate of the chief financial officer of the
Company with respect to solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis to the extent reasonably required in connection with the
Debt Financing, and other customary certificates or documents and back-up
therefor and legal opinions as may be reasonably requested by Parent and
otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral, all such obligations under
any such agreements to be subject to (and only effective following) the
Closing and conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers; (v) taking all
reasonably required corporate actions, subject to the consummation of the
Mergers, to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing; (vi) providing
customary authorization letters to any Financing Sources authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective Financing Sources and containing
customary representations to the arranger of any financing that the
information contained in any offering document or information memorandum
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; (vii) using commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Parent and Parents efforts to obtain customary
consents, landlord waivers and estoppels, non-disturbance agreements, non-
invasive environmental assessments, legal opinions, surveys and title
insurance (including providing reasonable access to Parent and its
representatives to all of the Companys Owned Real Property and all real
property that the Company or any or any of its Subsidiaries leases, subleases
or otherwise uses or occupies, or has the right to use or occupy, pursuant to
a Lease) as reasonably requested by Parent; (viii) taking all actions
reasonably necessary to permit the Financing Sources involved in the Debt
Financing to evaluate the Companys and each of its Subsidiaries current
assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures
relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements to
the extent customary and reasonable; (ix) requesting customary payoff letters,
lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing to
allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in full on the Closing Date of
all indebtedness and liens under the Companys financing facilities and
arrangements, as reasonably requested by Parent; (x) making available to
Parent and the Financing Sources promptly all documentation and other
information required by any applicable Governmental Authority with respect to
the Debt Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations; and (xi) cooperating reasonably with the
Financing Sources due diligence of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the
extent customary and reasonable. Parent shall, promptly upon request of
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable, documented out-of-
pocket expenses and costs incurred in

 



58  connection with the Companys or its Affiliates obligations under this
_Section 7.15_, provided however, that notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this clause (a) or any other provision of this Agreement, in no
event shall Parent, Merger Sub, Successor Sub, the Financing Sources or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives be
permitted to contact any customer, vendor or supplier of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers, the Share Issuance, the
Debt Financing or the other transactions contemplated hereby without the
Companys prior written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, delayed or refused in any circumstance.

(b) In addition, prior to the First Step Effective Time, the Company shall,
at the reasonable request of Parent: (i) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Grant Thornton LLP, independent accountants of the Company,

"affiliate" of the Company or Parent within the meaning of Rule 145

Stock in reliance on the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act, such Person shall furnish Parent with a certificate containing
factual representations as reasonably requested by Parent to support such
Persons reliance on Rule 144 and to support such Persons reliance on any
exemptions under any applicable state securities Laws relating to the
registration or qualification of securities for sale. Upon receipt of such
certificate, and assuming that all other conditions to reliance on Rule 144
and such exemptions under any applicable state Laws relating to the
registration or qualification of securities for sale have been satisfied,
Parent shall (a) cause its counsel to deliver a legal opinion stating that the
proposed sale or other disposition of such securities may be effected without
registration under the Securities Act and will not result in any violation of
any applicable state securities Laws relating to the registration or
qualification of securities for sale, and (b) after receipt of such legal
opinion, take such actions as are reasonably necessary to effect such transfer
of such securities.

 

Section 7.18 No Adverse Effect if Corporate Tax Imposed. Notwithstanding

_Section 7.18_ shall survive the consummation of the Mergers.

expenses of the Company, $1,000,000. In the event any Company Transaction Fee
is or becomes payable after the time the Company pays any Expense
Reimbursement (other than in the case of a Company Transaction Fee payable in
respect of a termination (1) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ in
connection with a Superior Proposal made by an Excluded Party, or (2) by
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.4(a_) in connection with a Change or

The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.5(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and
Successor Sub would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay
the Company Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 9.5(b)_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
of the Company Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime rate as announced in _The Wall

" _Parent Termination Fee_ " means an amount in cash equal to $9,600,000,
except in the event a Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section
9.5(c)(iii)_, in which case Parent Termination Fee means Expense Reimbursement
of the Company. The Parent Termination Fee shall be paid within two Business
Days of such termination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
one or more accounts designated by the Company. Subject to _Section 9.5(a)_,
the Company agrees that, payment of the Parent Termination Fee if the Parent
Termination Fee is actually paid as provided herein, will be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company (including, without limitation, as against the
Financing Sources and the Financing Source Related Parties) upon termination
of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.5(c)_. For the avoidance
of doubt and subject to Section 9.5(a), (1) in the event the Parent
Termination Fee is paid, under no circumstances will Parent, Merger Sub,
Successor Sub, the Financing Sources and any of their respective former,
current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners or assignees be liable for monetary
damages in excess of the Parent Termination Fee (and any amounts payable to
the Company pursuant to the last paragraph of _Section 9.5(c)_ below) whether
to the Company or any Affiliate thereof, (2) while the Company may pursue both

 



66  a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 10.5_ and the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee under _Section 9.5(c)_, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance and monetary damages, including all or any
portion of the Parent Termination Fee, and (3) under no circumstances will any
Financing Source have any liability hereunder to the Company or any Affiliate
thereof.

Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this  _Section 9.5(c)_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
Company would not enter into this Agreement. If Parent fails to pay the Parent
Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 9.5(c)_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a judgment
against Parent for the Parent Termination Fee, Parent shall pay to the Company
its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the Parent Termination Fee from the date such payment was required
to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate as announced in _The
Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made, after delivery to the Company of reasonable documentation evidencing
such costs and expenses.

 

(d) In the event a Company Termination Fee and a Parent Termination Fee is
payable at the same time, such fees will be set off against one another, with
the only payment required to be made being the net fee payable as a result of
such set off.

Section 9.6 Amendments; Waivers. At any time prior to the First Step
Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if,
and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of
an amendment, by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub, or in the
case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective;
_provided_ , _however_ , that _Sections 9.5(c)_ , _10.5_ , _10.8_ , _10.10_ ,
_10.11_ and _10.12_ and this  _Section 9.6_ may not be amended in any manner
that would be material and adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources (which such written consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that
after receipt of the Company Stockholders Approval, if any such amendment or
waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations
of NASDAQ require further approval of the stockholders of the Company, the
effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of
the stockholders of the Company. At any time prior to the First Step Effective
Time, any Party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of any other Party, (b) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other Party or (c)
waive compliance by any other Party with any of the agreements contained
herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such Partys
conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or Successor Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the Parties further agree that each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or

 



70  restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of actual damages
(and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), in any court of the United States or
any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other right or
remedy to which such Party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law or in
equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy for any such breach. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, including the provisions of this _Section 10.5_,
the Company shall not be entitled to seek and obtain specific performance of
Parents, Merger Subs and Successor Subs obligation to consummate the
Closing and effect the Mergers in accordance with _Section 1.3_ unless (a)
the Debt Financing (or Alternate Financing) is available, or will be
available, at the Closing if Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub were to
proceed with the Closing, and (b) all of the conditions set forth in _Section
8.1_ and _Section 8.3_ have been satisfied and continue to be satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied other
than at the Closing) and the Company has indicated in writing that the Company
is ready, willing and able to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , whether or not the Debt Financing (or
Alternate Financing) is available, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company from being entitled to and obtaining specific performance by the other
Parties of any pre-Closing covenant, agreement or obligation of any such
Party.

Section 10.6 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the maximum extent possible.

Section 10.8 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
together with the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and, except
as expressly set forth herein, supersede any and all other prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and, are not intended to confer upon
any Person, other than the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Successor Sub, any
rights or remedies, except that (a) the provisions of  _Article III_ shall be
enforceable by holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, (b) the
provisions of _Section 7.8_ shall be enforceable by Indemnified Parties to
the extent provided therein and (c) the provisions of _Section 9.5(c)_ (to
the extent provided for in the parenthetical referring to the Financing
Sources and the Financing Source Related Parties), _Sections 9.6_, _10.10_ ,
_10.11_ and _10.12_ shall be enforceable by the Financing Sources and the
Financing Source Related Parties. The Parties further agree that the rights of
third party beneficiaries under _Article III_ and _Section 7.8_ shall not
arise unless and until the First Step Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with _Section 9.6_ without notice or liability
to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in addition to the
Parties respective rights under _Section 10.5_, nothing in this Agreement is
intended to preclude a Party that has sought and been unable to obtain the
relief contemplated by _Section 10.5_ from asserting that its measure of
damages for fraud or intentional breach of any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement by another Party includes the loss of economic benefits to the
holders of such Partys common stock.

 



71 Section 10.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of any Party hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 10.10 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of law thereof. For all actions, suits and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (a) consent to the personal jurisdiction of
any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction located in the City of
Wilmington in the State of Delaware and (b) waive any defense or objection to
proceeding in such court, including those objections and defenses based on an
alleged lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue and forum non-
conveniens. The Parties acknowledge that all directions issued by any such
court, including all injunctions and other decrees, will be binding and
enforceable in all jurisdictions and countries. Process in any such suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting
the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such Party as
provided in _Section 10.2_ shall be deemed effective service of process on
such Party.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties further acknowledges and
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources or any Financing Source Related Party in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate
courts thereof).

 

Section 10.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE MERGERS AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE OR FINANCING
SOURCE RELATED PARTY). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (d) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.11_.

Section 10.12 Claims against Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (a) neither the Company nor any of its stockholders,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives will
have any rights or claims against the Financing Sources in connection with
this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Financing Agreements, whether at law or equity, in contract or tort or
otherwise and (b) the Company agrees not to commence any action or proceeding
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby (including any action or proceeding related to
the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements).
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, it is agreed that no
Financing Source shall have any liability

 



72  to the Company (or its stockholders, Affiliates, directors, officers,

qualify the obligations and liabilities of the parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Financing Agreements to each other thereunder.

 

Section 10.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

 

Section 10.14 Interpretation. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and the Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent Disclosure
Schedule and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Section
references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. References to
any statute, rule or regulation are to the statute, rule or regulation as
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the
case of any statutes, include any rules and regulations promulgated under
said statutes) and to any section of any statute, rule or regulation include
an successor to said section. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." Unless the context otherwise requires, "or"
is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable
to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the
masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. This

May 3, 2015

PMFG, Inc.

Suite 500

 

Dallas, Texas 75254

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

In connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, of even date herewith (as
the same may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
entered into by and among PMFG, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), CECO Environmental Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Top Gear
Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Top Gear Acquisition II LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company, the undersigned, a holder of Parent Common
Stock, hereby agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Lock-Up
Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), effective upon the First Step Effective
Time (the " _Closing_ "). Terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 

To induce the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement and to effect the
Closing, the undersigned agrees that the undersigned will not, for a period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending one hundred eighty (180) days after
the Closing Date (the " _Lock-Up Period_ "), (1) offer, pledge, sell, contract
to sell, grant any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or
contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or (2)
enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any shares
of Parent Common Stock, or any options or warrants to purchase any shares of
Parent Common Stock, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
that represent the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock, whether
owned as of the Closing Date or thereafter acquired during the Lock-Up
Period, owned directly by the undersigned (including holding as a custodian)
or with respect to which the undersigned has beneficial ownership within the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(collectively, the " _Undersigned s Shares_"), whether any such transaction
described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of the
Undersigneds Shares or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The
foregoing restrictions are expressly agreed to preclude the undersigned from
engaging in any hedging or other transaction during the Lock-Up Period that is
designed to or that reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a
sale or disposition of the Undersigneds Shares even if such shares would be
disposed of by someone other than the undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or
other transactions would include, without limitation, any short sale or
any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including, without limitation, any
put or call option) with respect to any of the Undersigneds Shares or with
respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant
part of its value from such shares.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will not prohibit the
undersigned from (a) exercising options and/or warrants owned by the
undersigned as of the Closing Date that are exercisable for shares of Parent
Company Stock, it being understood, acknowledged and agreed that the shares of
Parent Common Stock acquired by the undersigned in connection therewith shall
be subject to this Agreement; (b) entering into a plan adopted pursuant to
Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to the
extent that such plan does not allow for any transaction restricted by this
Agreement during the Lock-Up Period; or (c) making (i) bona fide gifts of the
Undersigneds Shares to family members or family trusts, (ii) any transfer by
will or intestacy in case of death or (iii) any transfer of the Undersigneds
Shares for estate planning purposes to persons immediately related to such
transferor by blood, marriage or adoption, or any trust solely for the benefit
of such transferor and/or the persons described in the preceding
clause, provided, however, that with respect to each of the transfers
described in clause (c) of this sentence, prior, and as a condition precedent,
to such transfer, the transferee, or the trustee or legal guardian on behalf
of any transferee, agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement. For purposes hereof, "immediate family" shall mean any relationship
by blood, marriage or  adoption, not more remote than first cousin (including, without limitation,
lineal descendants, stepchildren, father, mother, brother, sister of the
undersigned or the undersigneds spouse). In addition to the foregoing, in
the event the undersigned is an entity rather than an individual, this
Agreement will not prevent any transfer of any or all of the Undersigneds
Shares to the stockholders of such entity, if it is a corporation, to the
members of such entity, if it is a limited liability company, or to the
partners of such entity, if it is a partnership; provided, however, that in
each such case, it shall be a condition to the transfer that such
transferee agrees in writing prior to such transfer to be bound by the terms
of this Agreement.

In addition, the undersigned agrees that the undersigned will not, during the
Lock-Up Period, make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to, the
registration of any of the Undersigneds Shares or any securities convertible
into, exercisable for, or exchangeable for the Undersigneds Shares.

The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer
instructions with the Parents transfer agent and registrar relating to the
transfer of the Undersigneds Shares, except in compliance with the
restrictions described above. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and its
transfer agent are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of
securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this
Agreement. Except for that certain Voting Agreement among the undersigned,
certain other shareholders of Parent and the Company, dated as of the
date hereof, the undersigned now has, and, except as contemplated and
permitted by the third paragraph of this Agreement, for the duration of this
Agreement will have, good and marketable title to the Undersigneds Shares,
free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and claims whatsoever.

The undersigned understands that the Company will proceed to effect the
Closing of the Mergers in reliance upon this Agreement. This Agreement is
irrevocable, may not be amended or modified in any manner, and shall be
binding upon the undersigned and the heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns of the undersigned. Moreover, the undersigned
understands and agrees that the Company is relying upon the accuracy,
completeness, and truth of the undersigneds representations, warranties,
agreements, and certifications contained in this Agreement. The undersigned
further understands and agrees that the Closing of the Mergers is intended to
and will provide material economic benefit to the undersigned.

If for any reason the Merger Agreement shall be terminated prior to the
Closing of the Mergers, then this Agreement shall terminate, cease to be of
any further force or effect, and the undersigned and the Undersigneds Shares
shall be released from any and all obligations hereunder.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.

(b) Such Stockholder does not beneficially own any shares of Parent Common
Stock other than (i) the Original Shares and (ii) any options, warrants or
other rights to acquire any additional shares of Parent Common Stock or any
security exercisable for or convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock,
set forth on the signature page of this Agreement (collectively, " _Options_
").

(c) Such Stockholder has full power and authority and legal capacity to enter
into, execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform fully such
Stockholders obligations hereunder (including the proxy described in _Section
3_ below). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
such Stockholder and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.

(d) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder,
the consummation by such Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby
or compliance by such Stockholder with any of the provisions hereof will
conflict with or result in a breach, or constitute a default (with or without

   3. | _Agreement to Vote Shares; Irrevocable Proxy_. 
---|--- 

(a) Each Stockholder agrees during the term of this Agreement to vote the
Shares, and to cause any holder of record of the Shares to vote or execute a
written consent or consents if the stockholders of Parent are requested to
vote their shares through the execution of an action by written consent in
lieu of any such annual or special meeting of the stockholders of Parent: (i)
in favor of the issuance by Parent of the Parent Common Stock Consideration to
be issued in connection with the Closing of the Mergers and any other action
required to consummate the Mergers that may be submitted to a vote of the
stockholders of Parent, at every meeting (or in connection with any action by
written consent) of the stockholders of Parent at which such matters are
considered and at every adjournment or postponement thereof; (ii) against (1)
any action, proposal, transaction or agreement

 



79  which could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Parent,
Merger Sub or Successor Sub under the Merger Agreement or of Stockholder
under this Agreement and (2) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement
that could reasonably be expected to impede or materially interfere with,
delay, discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the timely consummation of the
Mergers or the fulfillment of Parents, the Companys, Merger Subs or
Successor Subs conditions under the Merger Agreement or change in any manner

its sole discretion and without any other limitation on those matters other
than those set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) that are at any time or from time
to time presented for consideration to Parents stockholders generally. For
the avoidance of doubt, clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply to votes, if any,
solely on the election or removal of directors as recommended by Parents
board of directors.

 

(b) Each Stockholder hereby appoints the Company and any designee of the
Company, and each of them individually, its proxies and attorneys-in-fact,
with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote or act by written
consent during the term of this Agreement with respect to the Shares, but only
to the extent provided in and with respect to the matters described in 
_Section 3(a)_. This proxy and power of attorney is given to secure the
performance of the duties of such Stockholder under this Agreement. Each
Stockholder shall take such further action or execute such other instruments
as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy. This
proxy and power of attorney granted by each Stockholder shall be irrevocable
during the term of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be coupled with an
interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable proxy, is intended to be
irrevocable during the term of this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of Section 212 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and shall
revoke any and all prior proxies granted by such Stockholder with respect to
the Shares (but only with respect to the matters set forth in _Section
3(a)_); provided that such Stockholder may grant subsequent proxies with
respect to any matter other than those specified in  _Section 3(a)_. The
power of attorney granted by each Stockholder herein is a durable power of
attorney and shall survive the dissolution, bankruptcy, death or incapacity of
such Stockholder. The proxy and power of attorney granted hereunder shall
terminate automatically upon the termination of this Agreement.

Each Stockholder agrees that such Stockholder will not, and will not permit
any entity under such Stockholders control to, deposit any of the Shares in a
voting trust, grant any proxies with respect to the Shares or subject any of
the Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of the Shares, in
each case, that would be inconsistent with _Section 2_ above, other than
agreements entered into with the Company.



   4. | _Transfer and Encumbrance_. 
---|--- 

Each Stockholder agrees that during the term of this Agreement, such
Stockholder shall not Transfer any of the Shares or enter into any contract,
option or other agreement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of, any
of the Shares or such Stockholders economic interest therein. Any attempted
Transfer of Shares or any interest therein in violation of this _Section 4_
shall be null and void.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
will not prohibit any Stockholder from (a) exercising options and/or warrants
owned by such Stockholder that are exercisable for shares of Parent Company
Stock, it being understood, acknowledged and agreed that the shares of Parent
Common Stock acquired by such Stockholder in connection therewith shall be
subject to this Agreement as "Shares"; (b) entering into a plan adopted
pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, to the extent that such plan does not allow for any Transfer of
Shares during the term of this Agreement; or (c) making (i) bona fide gifts of
such Stockholders Shares to family members or family trusts, (ii) any
transfer by will or intestacy in case of death or (iii) any Transfer of such
Stockholders Shares for estate planning purposes to persons immediately
related to such transferor by blood, marriage or adoption, or any trust
solely for the benefit of such transferor and/or the persons described in the
preceding clause, provided, however,

 



80  that with respect to each of the Transfers described in clause (c) of this
sentence, prior, and as a condition precedent, to such transfer, the
transferee, or the trustee or legal guardian on behalf of any transferee,
agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. For purposes
hereof, "immediate family" shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or
adoption, not more remote than first cousin (including, without limitation,
lineal descendants, stepchildren, father, mother, brother, sister of the
applicable Stockholder or the applicable Stockholders spouse). In addition to
the foregoing, in the event a Stockholder is an entity rather than
an individual, this Agreement will not prevent any transfer of any or all of
such Stockholders Shares to the stockholders of such entity, if it is a
corporation, to the members of such entity, if it is a limited liability
company, or to the partners of such entity, if it is a partnership; provided,
however, that in each such case, it shall be a condition to the transfer that
such transferee agrees in writing prior to such transfer to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement.

 



   5. | _Additional Shares_. 
---|--- 

Each Stockholder agrees that all shares of Parent Common Stock that such
Stockholder purchases, acquires the right to vote or otherwise acquires
beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
after the execution of, and prior to the termination of, this Agreement shall
be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall constitute Shares for all
purposes of this Agreement.



   6. | _Termination_. 
---|--- 

This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the First
Step Effective Time, (b) the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms, and (c) the mutual agreement of the Company and
the Stockholders to terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that (i)
_Section 11_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) the
termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the Stockholders from any
liability for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, or
covenant contained in this Agreement.



   7. | _No Agreement as Director or Officer_. 
---|--- 

Each Stockholder makes no agreement or understanding in this Agreement in
such Stockholders capacity as a director or officer of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries (if such Stockholder holds any such directorship or office), and
nothing in this Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions
taken by such Stockholder in such Stockholders capacity as such a director or
officer, including in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement, and no
such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or (b)
will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict such Stockholder from
exercising such Stockholders fiduciary duties as an officer or director of
Parent or its stockholders.

 



   8. | _Specific Performance_. 
---|--- 

Each party hereto acknowledges that it may be difficult to measure in money
the damage to the other party if a party hereto fails to comply with any of
the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such
failure, the other party may not have an adequate remedy at law or
damages. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that each other party may seek
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, in addition to remedies at law
or damages, for any such failure. Each party hereto agrees that it will not
seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a
bond in connection with the other partys seeking or obtaining such equitable
relief.



   9. | _Entire Agreement_. 
---|--- 

This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the
entire agreement between and among the parties with respect to the

 



81  subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented,
and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto. No waiver of any provisions
hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by
such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any
provision hereof by such party.

 



   10. | _Notices_. 
---|---

those objections and defenses based on an alleged lack of personal
jurisdiction, improper venue and forum non-conveniens. The parties acknowledge
that all directions issued by any such court, including all injunctions and
other decrees, will be binding and enforceable in all jurisdictions and
countries. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any

outstanding Common Stock may remove such Director or Directors for cause.

 

ARTICLE VIII

To the full extent permitted by the DGCL or any other applicable law
currently or hereafter in effect, no Director of the Company will be
personally liable to the Company or its stockholders for or with respect to
any acts or omissions in the performance of his or her duties as a Director
of the Company. Any repeal or modification of this Article VIII will not
adversely affect any right or protection of a Director of the Company existing
prior to such repeal or modification.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

Section 1. _ Right to Indemnification_ _._ Each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_ ") by reason of
the fact that the person is or was a director or an officer of the Company,
or is or was serving at the request of the Company, while a director or
officer of the Company, as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including
service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _Indemnitee_ "),
whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while
serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent permitted or required by
the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of
any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company
to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Company
to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such
Indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as
provided in Section 3 of this Article IX with respect to Proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification, the Company  shall indemnify any such Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such Proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company.

Section 2. _ Right to Advancement of Expenses_ _._ The right to
indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article IX shall include the
right to be paid by the Company the expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in defending any such Proceeding in
advance of its final disposition (an " _Advancement of Expenses_ ");
provided, however, that, if the DGCL so requires, an Advancement of Expenses
incurred by an Indemnitee in such persons capacity as a director or officer
(and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such
Indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit
plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking (an "
_Undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (a _"Final Adjudication"_ ) that
such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under
this Section 2 or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and to the
Advancement of Expenses conferred in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article IX shall
be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the Indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators.

 

Section 3. _ Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section 1
or 2 of this Article IX is not paid in full by the Company within 60 calendar
days after a written claim has been received by the Company, except in the
case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case the applicable
period shall be 20 calendar days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter
bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If
successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the
Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of
an Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the
Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit
brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an Advancement of Expenses)
it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Company to
recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking,
the Company shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a Final
Adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Company
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders)
to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that
indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the
Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL,
nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of
such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
Advancement of Expenses hereunder, or brought by the Company to recover an
Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of
proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such
Advancement of Expenses, under this Article IX or otherwise shall be on the
Company.

Section 4. _ Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to
the Advancement of Expenses conferred in this Article IX shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, any
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

Section 5. _ Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Company_.
The Company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of
Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the Advancement of Expenses
to any employee or agent of the Company or to any person who serves at the
request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including
service with respect to an employee benefit plan, to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Article IX with respect to the indemnification and
Advancement of Expenses of directors and officers of the Company or as
otherwise permitted or required by the DGCL. Executed on behalf of the Company by a duly authorized officer thereof
on this day of , 2015.

NAME AND OFFICES

Section 1\. The name of the corporation is "PMFG, Inc."

 

Section 2\. The corporation may have offices at such places both within and
without the State of Delaware as the board of directors may from time to time
determine or the business of the corporation may require.

ARTICLE II

 

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

 

Section 1\. All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such place, if
any, either within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be designated
from time to time by resolution of the board of directors and stated in the
notice of meeting.

Section 2\. An annual meeting of the stockholders, commencing with the year
2016, shall be held on April 1, if not a legal holiday and, if a legal
holiday, then on the next secular day following at such location as may be
specified by the board of directors, when they shall elect by a plurality
vote a board of directors, and transact such other business as may properly be
brought before the meeting.

 

Section 3\. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes,
unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the articles of incorporation,
may be called at any time by the president, or a majority of the board of
directors, or by stockholders entitled to cast at least twenty percent of the
votes that all stockholders are entitled to cast at the particular
meeting, upon written request delivered to the secretary of the corporation.
Such request shall state the general nature of the business to be transacted
at the proposed meeting. Upon receipt of any such request, it shall be the
duty of the secretary to fix the time of the meeting which, if the meeting is
called pursuant to a statutory right, shall be held not more than sixty days
after the receipt of the request. If the secretary shall neglect to fix the
time of the meeting, the person or persons calling the meeting may do so.

Section 4\. Written notice of every meeting of the shareholders shall be given
by or at the direction of the secretary or other authorized person to each
shareholder entitled to vote thereat not less than ten days nor more than 60
days before the meeting, unless a greater period of notice is required by law.
If the secretary or other authorized person neglects or refuses to give
notice of a meeting, the person or persons calling the meeting may do so.

Section 5\. Business transacted at all special meetings of stockholders shall
be limited to the purposes stated in the notice, provided that whenever the
language of a proposed resolution is included in the notice, the meeting
considering the resolution may without further notice adopt it with such
clarifying or other amendments as do not enlarge its original purpose.

Section 6\. The holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares
entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall be
requisite and shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders
for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or
by the articles of incorporation or by these bylaws. If, however, any meeting
of stockholders cannot be organized because a quorum has not attended, the
stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall
have power, except as otherwise provided by statute, to adjourn the meeting to
such time and place as they may determine, but in the case of any meeting
called for the election of directors, such meeting may be adjourned only from
day to day or for such longer periods not exceeding fifteen days each as the
holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy shall
direct. Those stockholders entitled to vote who attend a meeting called for
the election of directors that has been previously adjourned for lack of a
quorum, although less than a quorum, shall nevertheless constitute a quorum
for the purpose of electing directors. Those stockholders entitled to vote who attend a meeting of stockholders that
has been previously adjourned for one or more periods aggregating at least
fifteen days because of an absence of a quorum, although less than a quorum,
shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of acting upon any
matter set forth in the notice of the meeting if the notice states that those
stockholders who attend the adjourned meeting shall nevertheless constitute a
quorum for the purpose of acting upon the matter. At any adjourned meeting at
which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted
which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

Section 7\. Unless otherwise required by law or the Certificate of
Incorporation the election of directors shall be decided by a plurality of the
votes cast at a meeting of the stockholders by the holders of stock entitled
to vote in the election. Except as otherwise provided by law or by these
bylaws, whenever any corporate action is to be taken by vote of the
shareholders, other than the election of directors , it shall be authorized
upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by
all shareholders entitled to vote thereon.

Section 8\. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation,
every stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for every share standing in
the stockholders name on the books of the corporation. The articles may
restrict the number of votes that a single holder or beneficial owner, or such
a group of holders or owners, of shares of any class or series may directly
or indirectly cast in the aggregate for the election of directors or on any
other matter coming before the stockholders on the basis of any facts or
circumstances that are not manifestly unreasonable and as otherwise provided
by law. A stockholder may vote in person or by proxy authorized in accordance
with law.

Section 9\. Any action to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without
a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action to be so
taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted and shall be delivered (by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested) to the corporation by delivery to
its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of
business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book
in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Every written
consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the
consent, and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate
action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated
consent delivered in the manner required by this Section 9, written consents
signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the
corporation as aforesaid. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent
required by applicable law, be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing, and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting,
would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for
notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a
sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the
corporation.

 

Section 10\.

(a) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the board of directors, and which record date shall not be more
than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If the board
of directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the board
of directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later
date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making
such determination. If no record date is fixed by the board of directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record
date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned
meeting and in such case shall also fix   as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned
meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for the determination of
stockholders entitled to vote therewith at the adjourned meeting.

(b) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of
directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of
directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten days after the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board
of directors. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting: (i) when no prior action by
the board of directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose
shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the
action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by
delivery (by hand, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested) to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded and
(ii) if prior action by the board of directors is required by law, the record
date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which
the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

ARTICLE III

be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the stockholders at the
meeting at which such directors were elected and no notice of such meeting

place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors, or in the
event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the

shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business,
and the acts of a majority of the directors present and voting at a meeting at

as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the articles of
incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of directors,
the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be
present. 

Section 10\. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the
directors may be taken without a meeting if, prior or subsequent to the

filed with the secretary of the corporation.

disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Any such committee to
the extent provided in such resolution or in these bylaws, shall have and
exercise all of the powers and authority of the board of directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the corporation except as otherwise
restricted by law. In the absence or disqualification of any member of such
committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting
and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he, she or they constitute a

regular minutes of the proceedings and report the same to the board when

ARTICLE V

OFFICERS 

Section 1\. The officers of the corporation shall be appointed by the board of
directors and shall be a president, a secretary and a treasurer. The
president and secretary shall be natural persons of full age; the treasurer

SHARES 

Section 1\. The shares of stock of the corporation shall be represented by
certificates; provided that the board of directors may provide by resolution
or resolutions that some or all of any class or series shall be uncertificated
shares that may be evidenced by a book-entry system maintained by the
registrar of such stock. If shares are represented by certificates,
such certificates shall be in the form, other than bearer form, approved by
the board of directors. The certificates representing shares of stock of each
class shall be signed by, or in the name of, the corporation by the chairman,
any vice chairman, the president or any vice president, and by the secretary,
any  assistant secretary, the treasurer or any assistant treasurer. Any or all
such signatures may be facsimiles. Although any officer, transfer agent or
registrar whose manual or facsimile signature is affixed to such a
certificate ceases to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate has been issued, it may nevertheless be issued by the corporation
with the same effect as if such officer, transfer agent or registrar were
still such at the date of its issue.

Section 2\. Where a certificate is signed by a transfer agent or an assistant
transfer agent or a registrar, the signature of any president, vice-
president, treasurer, assistant treasurer, secretary or assistant secretary
may be facsimile. In case any officer or officers who have signed, or whose
facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any such certificate or
certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation,
whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or
certificates have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate or
certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the corporation and be issued and
delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or
certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used
thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation.

Section 3\. Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the
corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper
evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the
duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled

vote of the stockholders entitled to vote thereon at any regular or special
meeting duly convened after notice to the stockholders of that purpose or by a
majority vote of the members of the board of directors at any regular or
special meeting duly convened after notice to the directors of that purpose,

directors and subject to other statutory restrictions.
