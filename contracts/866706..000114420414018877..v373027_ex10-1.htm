30 calendar days after the date Parent receives the Buyer's calculation
thereof, Parent shall deliver to the Buyer a Notice of Dispute. If no Notice
of Dispute is delivered by Parent within such 30 calendar day period or if
Parent delivers a written acceptance of the Closing Statement during such 30
calendar day period, then such Closing Statement and Closing Working Capital,
the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Transactional Expenses and the Closing
Special Receivable shall become final and binding as of the end of such 30
calendar day period or the date of receipt by the Buyer of such written
acceptance, as applicable.

  



  

(c) In the event that Parent delivers to the Buyer a Notice of Dispute, the
Buyer and Parent shall promptly consult and cooperate with each other in good
faith with respect to the specified points of disagreement in an effort to
resolve the dispute and upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to the
Closing Statement or Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness, the
Closing Transactional Expenses or the Closing Special Receivable shall be
made as agreed upon by the Buyer and Parent. If any such dispute cannot be
resolved by Parent and the Buyer within 30 calendar days after the Buyer
receives the Notice of Dispute, Parent and the Buyer shall jointly refer the
dispute to Deloitte and Touche LLP (the " _Arbiter_ "), as an arbitrator to
finally resolve, as soon as practicable, and in any event within 45 calendar
days after such reference, all points of disagreement with respect to the
Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Transactional
Expenses or the Closing Special Receivable reflected on the Closing
Statement. For purposes of such arbitration each of Parent and the Buyer shall
submit a proposed calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Transactional Expenses or the Closing Special
Receivable, as applicable. The Arbiter shall apply the terms of _Sections
2.4_ and _2.5_ of this Agreement and all relevant definitions contained
herein, and shall otherwise conduct the arbitration under such procedures as
the Parties may agree or, failing such agreement, under the then prevailing
Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Parent and the Buyer
shall each furnish the Arbiter with such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues as the Arbiter shall
request, and, subject to _Section 6.4_ , shall provide copies to the other
Party of any work papers, documents and information so furnished to the
Arbiter. Each of the Parties shall bear its own expenses in connection with
the arbitration. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter incurred in connection
with the arbitration of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness,
the Closing Transactional Expenses or the Closing Special Receivable, as
applicable, shall be allocated between Parent and the Buyer by the Arbiter in
proportion to the extent either of such Parties did not prevail on items in
dispute with respect to the Closing Working Capital, the
Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Transactional Expenses or the Closing
Special Receivable, as applicable, reflected on the Closing
Statement; provided, that such fees and expenses shall not include, so long
as a Party complies with the procedures of this Section, the other Party's
outside counsel or accounting fees. The Parties agree not to engage in any ex
parte communication with the Arbiter. All determinations by the Arbiter shall
be final, conclusive and binding with respect to the Closing Working Capital,
the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Transactional Expenses or the Closing
Special Receivable and the allocation of arbitration fees and expenses, in
the absence of fraud or manifest error. The Closing Statement and Closing
Working Capital (i) if deemed final in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_ , as
originally submitted by Parent, or (ii) if a Notice of Dispute has been timely
delivered by the Buyer in accordance with this _Section 2.5(c)_, as
determined pursuant to the resolution of such dispute pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(c)_ , shall be, respectively, the " _Final Statement_ ", the "
_Final Working Capital_ ", the " _Final Indebtedness_ ", the " _Final
Transactional Expenses_ " and the " _Final Special Receivable_ ".

(d) Based on the Closing Statement as finally determined under _Section
2.5(a)_ or, if necessary, _S ection 2.5(b) or (c)_, the Closing Payment shall
be increased or decreased, as the case may be, on dollar-for-dollar basis by
the amount equal to the following (the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ "):

  



  

(i)  the sum of (a) any amount by which Closing Working Capital reflected on
the Closing Statement exceeds the Estimated Working Capital, (b) any amount
by which Estimated Indebtedness exceeds Final Indebtedness and (c) any amount
by which Estimated Transactional Expenses exceed Final Transaction Expenses;

  



  

 _minus_

  



  

(ii) the sum of (x) any amount by which Estimated Working Capital exceeds the
Closing Working Capital reflected on the Closing Statement, (y) any amount by
which Final Indebtedness exceeds Estimated Indebtedness and (z) any amount by
which Final Transactional Expenses exceed Estimated Transactional Expenses.

  



  

(e) If the Net Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Buyer shall
pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Net Adjustment Amount, or, if the Net
Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then Parent shall cause to be paid to
the Buyer the Net Adjustment Amount, in either case, plus interest,
compounded annually, calculated using a 365 day year from the Closing Date
through the date prior to the date of payment at the prime lending rate of
Bank of America, N.A. as in effect as of the Closing Date. Any payment so
required to be made by either Parent or the Buyer shall be by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, not more than seven (7) Business Days after
final determination thereof pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_ , to an account to be
designated by the payee at least two (2) Business Days prior to the due date.

  



  

   

17 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(f) Any adjustment attributable to the difference between the Estimated
Special Receivable and the Final Special Receivable shall not require any
payment or set-off, but instead shall increase or decrease the amount to be
remitted in accordance with the Special Receivable payment process described
in _Section 6.14_.

  



  

2.6 _Post-Closing Receipt of Invoices_. From and after the Closing Date, (a)
the Buyer shall remit to Parent all invoices and amounts received by the
Buyer after the Closing Date which relate to Parent's or any of its
Affiliates' businesses and (b) Parent shall remit to the Buyer all invoices
and amounts received by Parent after the Closing Date which relate to the
operation of the Business (other than amounts received in respect of the
Special Receivable), including invoices for any charges incurred by Employees
following the Effective Time (including any charges on credit cards issued in
Parent's name). The Buyer or Parent, as the case may be, shall pay and remit
to the applicable payee the amount of all such invoices in no event later than
the due date specified on the applicable invoice.

  



  

2.7 _Intercompany Accounts_. As of the Effective Time, all intercompany
accounts, other than those between the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, will be eliminated.

  



  

2.8 _Withholding_. Provided that Buyer gives prompt written notice to Parent
that Buyer reasonably believes it will be obligated to withhold tax, the
Buyer may deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable by it
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, provided that if there
is a change in the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
after the provision of such notice to Parent and prior to Closing that would
require the Buyer to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable
by it pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer shall be permitted to withhold and
deduct any such amounts from the amount paid hereunder. The Buyer shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such withholding. In the
event that any amount is so deducted and withheld, the Buyer shall properly
remit such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority. Any such
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the Person from whom such amount was withheld. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer shall not withhold with respect to U.S. Taxes so long as
Parent complies with the requirements of _Section 6.9(h)_ of this Agreement.

Article V _ 
  EMPLOYEES_

  



  

5.1 _The Buyer 's Obligations_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer shall credit (or cause to be credited) service accrued by
Employees as of the Effective Time for all purposes under its employee
benefit plans and shall treat such credit as the assumption of a liability
for all Tax purposes.

  



  

(b) Each Employee and, as applicable, Beneficiary shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in welfare benefit
plans of the Buyer or one of its Affiliates made available to such Employee
and Beneficiary (to the extent that coverage replaces coverage under a
comparable welfare benefit plan of Parent, in which such Employee or
Beneficiary participated immediately prior to the Closing). For purposes of
each welfare benefit plan of the Buyer or one of its Affiliates providing life
insurance (employer paid), disability or accident (employer paid), or
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Employee or
Beneficiary, the Buyer shall cause all evidence of insurability, pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such plans to be
waived for such Employee and his or her Beneficiaries.

  



  

(c) With respect to Benefit Plans in which benefits are subject to co-
payments, deductibles or similar thresholds, the Buyer or one of its
Affiliates will take any and all required actions necessary to give full
credit for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Effective
Time in the same plan year as if there had been a single continuous employer.

  



  

(d) Any retention bonuses due as a result of the Closing as disclosed in
_Disclosure Schedule 5.1(d)_ (including any employer Taxes, such as FICA,
FUTA and Medicare Taxes with respect thereto) (the " _Retention Bonuses_ ")
will be accrued on the Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement
and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not constitute Transactional Expenses.
Parent shall report any deductions from the Retention Bonuses (and related
Taxes) as a deduction on an income Tax Return of Parent. Parent shall receive
the benefit of any available deductions on any Tax Returns relating to the
payment of such Retention Bonuses. Neither the Buyer nor the Company shall
claim the benefit of such deduction on any Tax Return unless Parent is denied
such deduction and requests the Buyer or the Company to claim the deduction
(with any out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto, at Parent's sole expense),
and if the benefit is received by the Buyer or the Company, the after-Tax
amount of such benefit shall be paid to Parent by Buyer. On the first payroll
date following the Closing, the Company shall pay the Retention Bonuses to the
Employees and in the amounts as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule 5.1(d)_.

  



  

5.2 _Employment Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Continuation of Employment_. Effective as of the Effective Time, the
Company shall continue to be responsible for performing, and the Buyer shall

"). The Company or the Buyer shall inform Parent of the aggregate amount of
severance payments that is to be paid pursuant to the Employment and
Compensation Agreements as a result of the severance of an employee at any
time during the two-year period following the Closing (including required
employer Taxes, such as FICA, FUTA and Medicare Taxes) (such amount, less any
amount that is to be contemporaneously paid pursuant to such Employment and
Compensation Agreement on account of any pro-rata bonus under the Bonus Plan
for a Pre-Closing Period to the extent the Estimated Closing Statement and
the Closing Statement contain an accrual for such amount, the "
_Severance Payment Amount_ "), pursuant to the employee escrow agreement in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Employee Escrow Agreement_
"). In such event and pursuant to the terms of the Employee Escrow Agreement,
an amount equal to a percentage (which percentage shall be as set forth in
the Employee Escrow Agreement) of the Severance Payment Amount shall be paid
from the Employee Escrow Account, to the Company (the " _Escrow Reimbursement
Amount_ "). Such Escrow Reimbursement Amounts will be disbursed from the
Employee Escrow Account to the Company to reimburse amounts the Company has
paid through the Company's regular payroll process, subject to the provisions
of _Section 5.2(a)_.

  



  

   

42

(b) _Pension Plan_. Any Employees who are participants in the Pension Plan as
of the Effective Time shall continue to participate under the terms of such
plan following the Effective Time. Parent shall retain all liability relating
to the Pension Plan and any accrued benefits under the Pension Plan as of the

(c) _Individual Account Plans_.

  



  

(i) Parent shall, effective as of the Effective Time, cease all contributions
in respect of each Employee in Parent's tax-qualified defined contribution
plans in which such individual is then participating. As of the Effective
Time, the Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall have in effect one or more
defined contribution plans that include a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (" _Buyer 's
401(k) Plan_"). Each Employee who was a participant in one or more of the
Qualified Plans that are individual account plans as set forth on _Disclosure
Schedule 3.19(c)_ (" _Parent 's Savings Programs_") shall become a
participant in Buyer's 401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time. The
Buyer's 401(k) Plan shall comply with Section 411(d)(6) of the Code with
respect to the account balances to be transferred to the Buyer's 401(k) Plan,
and the Buyer shall indemnify and hold Parent and its Affiliates harmless from
and against any Losses arising from any failure to so comply.

  



  

(ii) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time and before such date
that Employees' loans under Parent's Savings Program would be deemed to be in
default, Buyer agrees to designate or establish one or more defined
contribution plans to receive a transfer of account balances of the affected
Employees maintained under the Parent's Savings Program. As soon as
reasonably possible after the requirements set forth in the preceding
sentence are satisfied, Parent shall cause the portion of the
Parent's Savings Program representing the account balances of the affected
Employees to be transferred to the plan(s) designated or established by Buyer
pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph. Parent and Buyer shall take
all steps necessary or appropriate to carry out the plan-to-plan transfer
contemplated by this paragraph, including but not limited to, providing any
advance notice to participants and beneficiaries of the Parent's Savings
Program and filing any advance notices required by any federal laws,
including the Code and the regulations issued thereunder. Buyer shall take
any and all steps necessary or appropriate to maintain the tax-
qualified status of any plan(s) (and the related tax-exempt status of the
accompanying trust(s)) designated or maintained pursuant to this paragraph.

claims which shall be treated as set forth in _Section 5.2(f)_ , Parent shall
be responsible in accordance with its applicable welfare plans in effect prior
to the Effective Time for all medical and dental claims for expenses incurred
prior to the Effective Time by Employees and Beneficiaries. Reimbursement
for medical and dental expenses associated with such claims shall be
determined in accordance with the terms of Parent's medical and dental
programs as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Buyer shall
be responsible for all medical and dental claims for expenses incurred on and
after the Effective Time by Employees and Beneficiaries pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of plans maintained by the Buyer or one of its
Affiliates and in which Employees and Beneficiaries become enrolled

provide retiree life insurance and retiree medical benefits with respect to

Systems Inc. (formerly known as Distribution Control Systems Inc.), the
Company Subsidiaries or an Affiliate whose last source of eligible service
under the applicable retiree welfare benefit plan was with the Company,
Aclara Power-Line Systems Inc. (formerly known as Distribution Control Systems
Inc.) or the Company Subsidiaries, who retired prior to the Closing Date and
who were covered under retiree welfare programs of Parent or any other
Affiliate of Parent as of the Closing Date, and to Beneficiaries of any such
individuals. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent there is any unfunded

defending a Third Party Claim, the Buyer shall disclose such information if
Parent enters into a reasonably acceptable common interest agreement covering

shall not, for a period of six (6) years following the date hereof or such

6.4 _Confidentiality; Announcements_.

  



  

(a) In addition to, and without limitation of, the terms, provisions and
covenants of the Confidentiality Agreement dated July 19, 2013, between the
Buyer and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the Buyer acknowledges
that, in the course of its investigations of the Business, the Buyer and its
Representatives have and will become aware of confidential information
and documents of the Business, and that its use of such confidential
information and documents, or communication of such information to third
parties, could be detrimental to the Business. The Buyer covenants that prior
to Closing all information and documents concerning the Business reviewed by
the Buyer or its Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be maintained in confidence and shall
not be disclosed or used by the Buyer or its Representatives without
Parent's prior written consent, unless the Buyer can demonstrate that such
information is (i) otherwise publicly available without fault of the Buyer,
its Affiliates or Representatives or (ii) required to be disclosed pursuant to
any Law or Order applicable to the Buyer. With respect to information and
documents related to the Business, at Parent's request in the event that the
Closing shall not occur, (x) the Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, promptly destroy all information and documents
received from Parent and its Representatives concerning the Business, as the
case may be, (including any copies thereof), and the Buyer shall certify in
writing to Parent that such destruction has taken place, and (y) the Buyer
shall keep confidential and shall not use any such information or documents
unless required to disclose such information or documents pursuant to any Law
or Order applicable to the Buyer. In the event that the Buyer or any of its
Representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any such information or
documents as referred to in this paragraph, the Buyer shall provide Parent
with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable
Parent either to seek a protective order, at its expense, or other appropriate
remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure (and the Buyer shall
cooperate with Parent in seeking any such protective order or other
appropriate remedy) or to waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 6.4(a)_ or both. In the event that such protective order or
other appropriate remedy is not obtained, the Buyer shall furnish only that
portion of such information or documents that has been legally compelled, and
shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such disclosed documents or
information.

  



  

(b) Following the Closing, Parent shall maintain, and shall cause its
Affiliates to maintain, in confidence any information it or they have
in relation to the Business, including information acquired pursuant to
_Section 6.3_ , and such information shall not be disclosed or used by Parent
or its Affiliates without the Buyer's prior written consent, unless such
information is (i) otherwise publicly available through no breach by Parent
or its Affiliates of this _Section 6.4(b)_ or (ii) required to be disclosed
pursuant to any Law or Order applicable to Parent or its Affiliates, in which
event Parent shall provide the Buyer with prompt written notice before such
disclosure, sufficient to enable the Buyer either to seek a protective order,
at its expense, or other appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such
disclosure (and Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Buyer, at the
Buyer's expense, in seeking any such protective order or other appropriate
remedy) or to waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 6.4(b)_
or both. In the event that such protective order or other appropriate remedy
is not obtained, Parent shall furnish only that portion of such information
or documents that has been legally compelled, and shall exercise its
reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will
be accorded to such disclosed documents or information.

(c) The Parties agree that no press release or other public statement
concerning the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made without the prior
written approval of both Parent and the Buyer (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), except (i) the following details regarding the
transaction: (A) identity of the Parties, (B) the Purchase Price and (C) the
date of the Closing may be disclosed without the prior written approval of
the other Party, or (ii) as Parent or its Affiliates reasonably deem
necessary according to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or applicable
Law.

  



  

6.5 _Further Assurances; Cooperation_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, the Parties shall, on request, cooperate with
one another by furnishing any additional information, executing and
delivering any additional documents and instruments, and doing such other
things as may be reasonably required by the Parties or their counsel to
consummate or otherwise implement the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall cooperate (by providing access as set
forth in _Section 6.2_ ) and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to cooperate with the Buyer in obtaining any financing with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; provided that (i) such
cooperation does not interfere with the ongoing operations of Parent, the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries; (ii) in no event shall Parent, or, prior
to the Closing, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, be required to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other Liability in
connection with the financing; (iii) no obligation of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries shall be effective until the Closing and neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or representatives shall be required to take any action
under, or execute or agree to, any certificate, agreement or other document
that is not contingent upon the Closing and does not terminate without
Liability to Parent, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates upon termination of this Agreement; and (iv) neither
Parent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or representatives shall
be required to take any action under, or execute or agree to, any
certificate, agreement or other document in connection with Buyer's financing.
None of Parent, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates shall be required to bear any cost or expense or to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment in connection with
Buyer's financing. For the avoidance of doubt, obtaining any financing
by Buyer with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not
be a condition to Closing.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company to,
reasonably cooperate with the Buyer (i) to allow the Buyer to obtain, at the
Buyer's sole cost and expense, a commitment for a 2006 ALTA Owners Policy of
Title Insurance for each parcel of Owned Real Property, issued by a title
insurer reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, in such amount as the Buyer may
reasonably elect, insuring the fee interest in each such parcel of Owned Real
Property as of the Closing, subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances and
containing such endorsements as the Buyer may reasonably require (a " _Title
Policy_ "), and (ii) to allow the Buyer to procure, at Buyer's sole cost and
expense, a current as-built survey of each parcel of Owned Real Property,
prepared by a licensed surveyor satisfactory to the Buyer and conforming to
2011 ALTA/ACSM Minimum Detail Requirements, and revealing no encroachments or
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. Such cooperation by Parent
shall include providing all affidavits, undertakings and other title
clearance documents reasonably necessary or customary to cause Buyer's title
insurer to issue a Title Policy, or a commitment to issue a Title Policy
insuring, title to each parcel of Owned Real Property.

representation, warranty or statement contained in this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules hereto inaccurate or incomplete at any time prior to the
Closing, or which could reasonably be expected to render any representation,
warranty or statement contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules
hereto inaccurate or incomplete, including any such development or information
which first becomes known to Parent after the date hereof (" _Supplemental
Information_ "). The written notice pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall not
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made by Parent in this Agreement and shall not be deemed
to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules for any purpose. If any
Supplemental Information constitutes a Material Adverse Effect, Parent shall
identify it as such in writing to the Buyer and Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section 10.2(a)(v)_.

  



  

6.7 _Pre-closing Insurance_. The Parties agree that the Buyer, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall not have the benefit of or access to any
insurance policies, including any self-insurance, maintained by Parent or any
of its Affiliates (excluding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries),
excepting only any occurrence-based insurance policies which insured the
Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to Closing. In the event Buyer, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary submits a claim covered in whole or in part
under any such occurrence-based policy or policies, Buyer agrees to timely
pay on behalf of Parent or any of its Affiliates any amounts any of them may
be obligated to pay pursuant to the terms of such policy or policies,
including any self-insured retention or deductible.

(i) Following the Closing, and except as otherwise provided in _Section
6.9(b)_, Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed in a
timely manner all Tax Returns relating to the Company and the Company

1999-52 I.R.B. 757 with respect to the filing and furnishing of IRS Forms
1042-S, 1098, 1099, 5498, and W-2G for any federal tax information reporting

respect to the filing and furnishing of IRS Forms W-2, W-3, W-4, W-5 and 941

other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Parent shall provide
Buyer with all reasonably necessary information, materials and assistance with

reporting referenced in the preceding two sentences, which shall be accurate
and complete.

  



  

(ii) Such Tax Returns and information reporting shall be prepared, and each
item thereon treated, in a manner consistent with past practices employed
with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the extent
consistent with applicable Law. Parent shall have the right to review such
Tax Return for thirty (30) days prior to the filing of such Tax Returns (or,
for Tax Returns due taking into account any extension obtained less than
ninety (90) days after the end of the applicable reporting period, a number of
days equal to 33% of the number of days between the end of the applicable
reporting period or the Effective Date, if later, and the due date for such
Tax Return taking into account any extension obtained), and Buyer shall
consider in good faith any adjustments to such Tax Return that are reasonably
requested by Parent.

  



  

(d) All Taxes payable with respect to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
in respect of any Pre-Closing Period (and the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date) are the responsibility of and shall be paid by
Parent (including by payment directly or through an agent to the applicable
Tax authority (with a copy of proof of payment provided to the Buyer) or by
payment to the Company, except to the extent accrued as a current liability
on the Closing Statement. Taxes relating to a Straddle Period shall be pro-
rated between Parent and the Buyer; such Taxes for the Tax period ending at
the Effective Time are the responsibility of Parent and Taxes for the Tax
period beginning after the Effective Time are the responsibility of the Buyer.
Parent shall pay to the Buyer within fifteen (15) days after the date on
which the Taxes are paid with respect to such Straddle Periods an amount
equal to the portion of such Taxes that relates to the Tax period ending at
the Effective Time to the extent such Taxes are not paid prior to Closing,
are not paid by Parent after the Closing, or are not accrued as a liability on
the Closing Statement. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the portion of any
Property Tax and Taxes based on capitalization, debt or shares of stock
authorized, issued or outstanding, or similar ad valorem Taxes that relates

(e) Any refund of Taxes (including any interest thereon) that relates to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that is attributable to a Post-Closing
Period shall be the property of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, as
applicable, and shall be retained by the Company or the Company Subsidiary.
Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any such refund or
other benefit realized by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or an Affiliate
of the Company in a Post-Closing Period that results from the carry-
forward of any Tax attribute from a Pre-Closing Period shall be the property
of the Company or Affiliate of the Company and shall be retained by the
Company or Affiliate of the Company, as applicable. Any refund of Taxes

Company Subsidiaries attributable to a Pre-Closing Period or the portion of a
Straddle Period ending at the Effective Time, and any amounts credited
against Tax to which the Buyer, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries become
entitled, that relate to a refund attributable to such periods (for the
avoidance of doubt, a refund that results from the carry-forward of a Tax
attribute to a Post-Closing Period is not considered attributable to a Pre-
Closing Period) shall be for the account of Parent except to the extent
accrued as a current asset on the Closing Statement, and the Buyer shall pay
over to Parent any such Tax refund and interest received by it or the amount
of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof or
utilization of such credit. Any amounts credited against Tax to which the
Buyer, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries become entitled, that relate

ending at the Effective Time shall be for the account of Parent to the extent
it is attributable to tax payments made by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.9(d)_
, and the Buyer shall pay over to Parent the amount of any such Tax refund
and interest received by it or the amount of any such credit within fifteen
(15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax matter, and the filing of any
Tax Return, including in connection with calculating, claiming and
determining any research and development credit or deduction and any

(g) _Allocation_.

  



  

(i) The Purchase Price shall be allocated in the manner set forth on

to Parent for its approval an allocation of the Purchase Price and amounts
treated as liabilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for Tax
purposes among the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in
accordance with Code Section 1060 and any similar provision of state,
local, or foreign law as appropriate (" _Purchase Price Allocation_ ").
Parent shall timely and properly prepare, execute, file and deliver all such
documents, forms and other information as Buyer may reasonably request to
prepare the Purchase Price Allocation. Parent shall have sixty (60) days to
review and comment on such allocation, and identify potential adjustments
thereto. If Parent fails to identify potential adjustments within such sixty
(60) day period, Parent shall be deemed to have accepted the Purchase Price
Allocation as calculated by the Buyer. If Parent raises any objections to the
Buyer's proposed allocations, the Buyer and Parent shall negotiate in good
faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute.
If the Buyer and Parent are unable to agree on the Purchase Price Allocation
within one-hundred twenty (120) days after the final determination of the
Closing Working Capital, the Buyer and Parent are permitted to report such
allocation separately.

  



  

(ii) For all Tax purposes (including without limitation the filing of
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594), Buyer, Parent, and the Affiliates of
each of them, shall take no position for Tax purposes inconsistent or contrary
to any Purchase Price Allocation agreed to in  _Section 6.9(g)(i)_ (" _Agreed
Allocation_ ") unless required to do so by applicable Law. In the event
that the Agreed Allocation is disputed by any Tax authority, the Party
receiving notice of such dispute will promptly notify the other Party and the
Parties will consult in good faith how to resolve such dispute in a manner
consistent with such Agreed Allocation.

Parent and its Affiliates from any Surety Bond Obligations, including by
exercising any applicable termination rights.

  



  

(c) From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Company to

application of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or (ii) by reason
of the treatment of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as under common
control with Parent or any of its Affiliates as a result of the application
of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (1) under Section 302 of ERISA, (2) under
Title IV of ERISA, (3) under Sections 412 or 4971 of the Code, or (4) in
respect of an employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA) sponsored or maintained by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (other than
the Company or a Company Subsidiary) because of Section 607(4) of ERISA or
Section 414(t) of the Code; and

  



  

(h) any Liability of Parent to the extent such Liability does not relate to
the Business, the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  



  

9.2 _Indemnification by the Buyer_. From and after Closing, the Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and Parent's Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, officers and employees (in their capacity as such) (the
" _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") against and in respect of any and all
Losses actually incurred by any Parent Indemnified Party arising from:

  



  

(a) any breach or violation of the covenants made in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement (other than the Guarantee Reimbursement Agreement) by the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates;

  



  

(b) any inaccuracy or breach of any Fundamental Representation made by the
Buyer;

  



  

(c) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Buyer in this Agreement or in any of the Ancillary Agreements (other than the
Guarantee Reimbursement Agreement), resulting from fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates; and

  



  

(d) the ownership, use or possession of the Interests, the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, or the conduct or operation of the Business, arising
solely after the Effective Time (except, in each such case, to the extent that
the Buyer is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or to the
extent relating to the Guarantee Reimbursement Agreement or the Guaranteed
Obligations).

  



  

9.3 _Notice and Payment of Losses_. Upon obtaining knowledge of any Loss
(other than any Loss relating to the Guarantee Reimbursement Agreement or the
Guaranteed Obligations which are governed by the terms of the Guarantee
Reimbursement Agreement), the Party entitled to indemnification (the "
_Injured Party_ ") shall promptly notify the Party liable for such
indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of such Losses
which the Injured Party has determined have given or could give rise to a
claim under  _Section 9.1_ or _9.2_ (such written notice being hereinafter
referred to as a " _Notice of Claim_ "); provided, however, that failure of
an Injured Party promptly to give a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its indemnity obligations set
forth in this _Article IX_ except to the extent that such failure materially
and adversely affects the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend such
claim or increases the amount of indemnification which the Indemnifying Party
is obligated to pay hereunder, in which event the amount of indemnification
which the Injured Party shall be entitled to receive shall be reduced to an
amount which the Injured Party would have been entitled to receive had
such Notice of Claim been promptly given. The Injured Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any continuing Losses and to
obtain or use any Tax savings, benefit, relief, deduction or credit available
to the Injured Party. If the Injured Party settles or compromises any third
party claims prior to giving a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be released from its indemnity obligation;
_provided_ , _however_ , the amount of such settlement shall not be presumed
to be the amount of the indemnity obligation. A Notice of Claim shall specify
in reasonable detail, to the extent known by the Injured Party, the nature
and, to the extent reasonably calculable, estimated amount of any such claim
giving rise to a right of indemnification. The Indemnifying Party shall
satisfy its obligations under _Section 9.1_ or _9.2_ , as the case may be,
within forty-five (45) days of its receipt of a Notice of Claim; provided,
however, that for so long as the Indemnifying Party is disputing its
liability or defending a Third Party Claim in good faith, its obligations to
indemnify the Injured Party with respect thereto shall be suspended until (i)
it is no longer disputing its liability or defending a Third Party Claim in
good faith or (ii) a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction is given in relation to such claim, whichever is earlier. The
Indemnifying Party shall have forty-five (45) days after receipt of a Notice
of Claim or fifteen (15) days after of receipt of any New Facts to notify the
Injured Party (a) whether or not it disputes its liability to the Injured
Party with respect to such Notice of Claim and (b) whether it elects to
defend a Third Party Claim pursuant to _Section 9.4_ (the "
_Indemnifying Party Defense Review Period_ ").

9.4 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) With respect to any action or any claim set forth in a Notice of Claim
relating to a claim asserted by any claimant other than (1) an Injured Party
hereunder or (2) with respect to any claim under the Guarantee Reimbursement
Agreement, (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party may defend, in
good faith and at its expense, any such claim or demand. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to control or conduct the defense or prosecution of
a Third Party Claim within the Indemnifying Party Defense Review Period: (i)
the Injured Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate
in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Party Claim with its own
counsel at its own expense unless separate representation is necessary to
avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation by a single
firm of counsel for all Injured Parties shall be at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party; (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall be conclusively
deemed to have acknowledged that the Third Party Claim is within the scope of
its indemnity obligation under this Agreement, provided, however, that upon
the disclosure of New Facts to the Indemnifying Party, such acknowledgement
shall be void and the Indemnifying Party shall have fifteen (15) days after
receipt of such New Facts to notify the Injured Party (1) whether or not it
disputes its liability to the Injured Party and (2) whether it elects to
maintain the defense of such Third Party Claim; (iii) the Indemnifying Party
shall conduct the defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim diligently
and, to the extent requested by the Injured Party, provide copies of all
correspondence and related documentation in connection with the defense of
the Third Party Claim to the Injured Party; and (iv) the Indemnifying
Party will not take any action, or omit to take any action, without the
consent of the Injured Party, that would cause (x) any
Contracts, correspondence or other documents of the Injured Party or its
Affiliates containing confidential information of the Injured Party or its
Affiliates to be disclosed to a third party except to the extent a protective
order or other obligation of confidentiality is obtained prior to any such
disclosure, or (y) any director, officer, employee or agent of the Injured
Party to take any action related to the Third Party Claim which could
interfere with or contravene such Person\'s duties to the Injured Party or its
Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, if the Injured Party previously
delivered a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying
Party is or was eligible to but has not elected or did not elect to assume
control of the defense of such claim, then the Injured Party shall promptly
(i) disclose in writing to the Indemnifying Party any material new or
materially changed allegations or claims being asserted against the Injured
Party in respect of such claim, and (ii) upon request of the Indemnifying
Party, provide a written summary of the status of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party (all of the information provided in the immediately
preceding clauses (i) and (ii) above, if such summary discloses a change that
is adverse to the Indemnifying Party, " _New Facts_ ") provided, however,
that failure of an Injured Party promptly to give a notice of New Facts to the
Indemnifying Party shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its
indemnity obligations set forth in this _Article IX_ except to the extent that
such failure materially and adversely affects the ability of the Indemnifying
Party to defend such claim or increases the amount of indemnification which
the Indemnifying Party is obligated to pay hereunder, in which event the
amount of indemnification which the Injured Party shall be entitled to
receive shall be reduced to an amount which the Injured Party would have been
entitled to receive had such notice of New Facts been promptly given. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Injured Party shall reasonably cooperate (with any out-of-pocket expenses at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party) with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, including (x)
procuring potential witnesses and witness statements, (y) promptly furnishing
documentary evidence to the extent available to it or its Affiliates, and (z)
providing access to any other relevant party, including any employees or
agents of, or advisers to, the Parties as reasonably needed, including to
obtain technical advice or assistance, to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of such Third Party Claim. No Indemnifying Party or Injured Party may
compromise or settle any Third Party Claim hereunder without the written
consent of the Injured Party or Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided
that consent from the Injured Party will not be required if, as part of such
settlement, compromise or judgment, such Injured Party is unconditionally
released from or absolved of further liability at no cost to such Injured
Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party has undertaken to defend any such
Third Party Claim, the Injured Party shall not settle or compromise such
Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

   

65 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.4_ to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume the defense or
prosecution of a Third Party Claim if: (i) the Third Party Claim seeks, in
addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, any injunctive or other equitable
relief; or (ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with
any criminal action, indictment or allegation. In such case, (1) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Party Claim
with its own counsel at its own expense, and (2) the Injured Party shall
conduct the defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim diligently and,
to the extent requested by the Indemnifying Party, provide copies of
all correspondence and related documentation in connection with the defense
of the Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party. The Injured Party may not
compromise or settle any Third Party Claim under this _Section 9.4(b)_ without
the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

9.5 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 9.6(h)_ , the respective
representations and warranties of Parent and the Buyer contained in _Article
III_ and _Article IV_ (except for the representations and warranties set forth
in _Sections 3.1_ (other than _3.1(d)(iii)_ , _3.1(d)(v)_ or _(3.1(e)_ ) and
_4.1_ (Existence and Power; Non-Contravention), _Sections 3.2_ and _4.2_
(Valid and Enforceable Agreement; Authorization), _Section 3.3_ (other than
_Section 3.3(e)_ ) (Capitalization and Ownership), _Section 3.7_ (Taxes) and
_Section 3.27_ (Brokers, Finders) (the " _Fundamental Representations_ "))
shall not survive the Closing. The Fundamental Representations shall survive
the Closing until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including any extensions thereof). The certificates delivered pursuant to
_Sections 7.1_ and _8.1_ shall be deemed to be additional representations and
warranties, and shall expire in the same manner as the respective underlying
representations and warranties in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ expire and
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms, conditions and limitations as
the respective underlying representations and warranties in _Article III_ and
_Article IV_ are subject, all as provided in this _Article IX_.

  



  

(b) All covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms are to
be performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit actions, subsequent to
the Closing Date shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms. All
other covenants and agreements contained herein shall not survive the Closing
and shall thereupon terminate.

  



  

(c) Any claim for indemnity under this Agreement with respect to any breach
of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements not made within the
periods specified in _Section 9.5(a)_ , _Section 9.5(b)_ , _Section 9.6(h)_
and _Section 9.7_  shall be deemed time-barred, and no such claim shall be
made after the periods specified in _Section 9.5(a)_ , _Section 9.5(b)_ , 
_Section 9.6(h)_ and _Section 9.7_ ; provided, however, that if written notice
of a claim for indemnification under _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_ shall
have been provided to Parent or the Buyer, as the case may be, within the
applicable survival period and in good faith, then any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements that are the subject of such
indemnification claim that would otherwise terminate as set forth above shall
survive as to such claim, and that claim only, until such time as such claim
is fully and finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any claim for fraud, willful misrepresentation or willful
misconduct shall survive until expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations.

  



  

9.6 _Limitation on Indemnification._

  



  

(a) In no event shall the aggregate amount of all Losses for which Parent is
obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Sections
9.1(a)_ and _9.1(b)_ exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price (the "
_Indemnification Cap_ ").

  



  

   

67 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) All indemnification obligations shall be paid in U.S. Dollars in the
United States.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall any Injured Party be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this 
_Article IX_ to the extent any Losses were attributable to such Injured
Person's own fraud or willful misconduct.

  



  

(d) The Parties are in agreement that where the same set of facts qualifies
under more than one provision entitling the Buyer or Parent to a claim or
remedy under this Agreement, there shall be only one claim or remedy.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no liability,
obligation, contract or other matter shall constitute a breach of
any representation or warranty of Parent or entitle the Buyer to
indemnification hereunder:

  



  

(i) if the liability, obligation, contract or other matter is expressly set
out in the Disclosure Schedules in accordance with _Section 10.11_ ; or

  



  

(ii) to the extent that the liability, obligation, contract or other matter
was provided for, or specifically referred to, in the Closing Statement.

  



  

(f) All "material" and "Material Adverse Effect" or similar materiality type
qualifications contained in the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement shall be ignored and not given any effect for purposes of
determining the amount of any Losses subject to indemnification.

  



  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Article IX_ shall not
apply in any respect to claims under the Guarantee Reimbursement Agreement or
with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations.

  



  

(h) In the event that Parent notifies Buyer prior to the Closing of any
material inaccuracy or material breach of a representation or warranty made
by Parent in this Agreement (other than any Fundamental Representation) (a "
_Pre-Closing Breach_ ") or the Buyer otherwise becomes aware of a Pre-Closing
Breach and notifies Parent of such breach prior to the Closing, then
the provisions of this _Section 9.6(h)_ shall be applicable with respect to
such Pre-Closing Breach. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Buyer its good
faith estimate of the Losses that could reasonably be expected to be suffered
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in respect of the Pre-Closing
Breach, together with its calculation thereof, and the Buyer and Parent shall
seek in good faith to mutually agree on the estimate (such agreed amount, the
" _Loss Estimate_ "). In the event that the Parties do not mutually agree on
the Loss Estimate, then the Party asserting termination rights under _Sections
9.6(h)(ii)_  and _10.2(a)(vi)_ shall bear the risk and burden of proof as to
whether or not the Loss Estimate is equal to or greater than $7,000,000.

  



  

(i) If the Loss Estimate is less than $7,000,000, then Parent shall indemnify
the Buyer in respect of the Losses arising from such Pre-Closing Breach
pursuant to _Section 9.6(h)(iii)_ , and neither Parent nor the Buyer shall be
permitted to terminate this Agreement as a result of such Pre-Closing Breach.

  



  

   

68 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) In the event the Loss Estimate is equal to or greater than $7,000,000,
either the Buyer or Parent may terminate this Agreement by written notice to
the other Party in accordance with _Section 10.2(a)(vi)_ within fifteen (15)
Business Days following determination of the Loss Estimate. If neither the
Buyer nor Parent elects to terminate this Agreement within such 15 Business
Day time period, then Parent shall indemnify the Buyer in respect of the
Losses arising from such Pre-Closing Breach pursuant to _Section 9.6(h)(iii)_
, and neither Parent nor the Buyer shall be permitted to terminate this
Agreement as a result of such Pre-Closing Breach.

  



  

(iii) With respect to any Pre-Closing Breach to which this _Section_
_9.6(h)(iii)_ applies, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Parties against and in respect of any and all Losses actually
incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party arising from any such Pre-Closing
Breach in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Sections 9.3_ and
_9.4_. To the extent the amount of such Losses is determinable prior to
Closing, any such Losses shall offset the Closing Payment. Any claim
subject to this _Section 9.6(h)(iii)_ shall survive until such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved. The Parties agree that the provision for
indemnity under this _Section 9.6(h)(iii)_ shall be effective only when the
aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in
respect of all claims against Parent for indemnification under this
_Section 9.6(h)(iii)_ exceeds an amount equal to One Million Three Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($1,300,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for the full amount
of such Losses, including those that comprise any portion of the Deductible.

  



  

9.7 _Indemnifiable Warranty Claims_. In the event (a) Parent has knowledge of
a claim of breach of warranty associated with any customer as of or prior to
the Closing, and to Parent's knowledge the Losses arising from the claim are
as of the Closing, or may reasonably be estimated as of the Closing to be, in
excess of $300,000 (on an individual customer basis), and such breach of
warranty or warranty claim has not otherwise been disclosed to the Buyer
under this Agreement, including in _Disclosure Schedules 2.4(a)(ii), 3.12(b)_
 and _3.25(ii)_ (an " _Indemnifiable Warranty Claim_ ") and (b) the Buyer
provides written notice of such Indemnifiable Warranty Claim to Parent within
six (6) months following the Closing Date, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties against and in respect of any and all
Losses actually incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party arising from any such
Indemnifiable Warranty Claim in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Sections 9.3_ and _9.4_. Any claim subject to this _Section 9.7_ for which
notice has been given to Parent shall survive until such time as such claim is
fully and finally resolved. The Parties agree that the provision for
indemnity under this _Section 9.7_ shall be effective only when the aggregate
amount of all Losses (any such individual Loss to be net of any specifically
identified warranty accrual or, alternatively, the agreed upon warranty
reserve, pro-rated pursuant to the applicable reserve formula, as reported on
the Final Statement) incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of
an individual Indemnifiable Warranty Claim exceeds an amount equal to Three
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000) (the " _Indemnifiable Warranty Claim
Deductible_ "), in which case the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to indemnification for the full amount of such Indemnifiable Warranty Claim
and the Losses relating thereto, including any that comprise any portion of
the Indemnifiable Warranty Claim Deductible; provided, however, that in no
event shall the aggregate amount of all Losses for which Parent is obligated
to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section 9.7_
exceed an amount equal to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000).

  



  

   

69 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

9.8 _Characterization of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnification payments
made pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered, to the extent
permissible under Law, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes.

  



  

9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. In the absence of fraud, willful misrepresentation or
willful misconduct, the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
IX_ shall provide the exclusive remedy for breach of any covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or any other agreement
ancillary hereto executed pursuant to this Agreement or related to the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Business (other than the Guarantee
Reimbursement Agreement); provided however, such limitation shall not impair
the rights of any of the Parties to seek non-monetary equitable relief to
redress any default or breach of this Agreement, including specific
performance or injunctive relief. In connection with the seeking of any non-
monetary equitable relief, each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Party hereto would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached.

  



  

9.10 _Certain Damages_. In no event shall any Injured Party be entitled to
recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of, and in no event shall
" _Losses_ " for purposes of this Agreement (including amounts indemnifiable
under _Sections 9.1_ ,  _9.2_ , _9.6(h)_ or _9.7_ ) be deemed to include, (a)
consequential, incidental or indirect damages, lost profits or punitive,
special or exemplary damages and, in particular, damages calculated by
"multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation
methodology or (b) any Loss, Liability, damage or expense to the extent
included as a liability or expense on the Financial Statements (including the
footnotes thereto) or to the extent included in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that the sole remedy
for claims relating to the determination of the Net Adjustment Amount shall
be as provided in _Section 2.5_.

  



  

Article X _ 
  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

  



  

10.1 _Notice_. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications
required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be

10.2 _Termination_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement may
be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date:

  



  

(i) by the mutual written consent of the Buyer and Parent;

  



  

(ii) by the Buyer or Parent, upon written notice to the other Party, if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated on or
prior to April 30, 2014 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless such failure of
consummation is due to the failure of the Party seeking such termination to
perform or observe in all material respects the covenants and agreements
hereof to be performed or observed by such Party;

  



  

(iii) by the Buyer or Parent, upon written notice to the other Party, if a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction has issued an Order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order has become final
and non-appealable; provided, however, that the Party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_ has used its
reasonable best efforts to remove such Order;

  



  

(iv) by the Buyer or Parent if any condition to such Party's obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby is incapable of being
satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date; provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 10.2(a)(iv)_ is not
available to any Party whose breach of its obligations under this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in, the inability of such condition to be
satisfied;

  



  

(v) by the Buyer, upon written notice to Parent within five (5) Business Days
of receipt from Buyer of any Supplemental Information identified by Parent as
having a Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(vi) by the Buyer or Parent in accordance with _Section 9.6(h)(ii)_.

  



  

(b) In the event of any termination of the Agreement as provided in this
_Section 10.2_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become wholly void and of no
further force and effect and there shall be no liability on the part of the
Buyer or Parent, except with respect to any breach of this Agreement
occurring prior to termination and except that the provisions of _Section
6.4(a)_ and this  _Article X_ shall survive any such termination of this
Agreement.

  



  

10.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Schedules and Exhibits hereto
and the Ancillary Agreements (other than the Guarantee
Reimbursement Agreement) embody the entire agreement and understanding of the
Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all
prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement will
survive Closing and will remain in effect.

  



  

10.4 _Severability_. If any provision hereof shall be held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction or as a result of
future legislative action, such holding or action shall be strictly construed
and shall not affect the validity or effect of any other provision hereof, as
long as the remaining provisions, taken together, are sufficient to carry out
the overall intentions of the Parties as evidenced hereby.

10.5 _Assignment; Binding Agreement_. This Agreement and various rights and
obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder
shall be transferred, delegated, or assigned by the Parties hereto without the
prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), except that, subject to the terms of the Guarantee
Reimbursement Agreement, the Buyer shall have the right to assign the
Agreement and transfer and assign its rights hereunder without the consent of
Parent to any Affiliate of the Buyer, any financial institution, lender or
investor providing the Buyer debt or equity financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to any Person that acquires,
by purchase of stock, purchase of assets, merger or other form of
transaction, all or substantially all of the business and assets of the Buyer.

  



  

10.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
multiple counterparts, and in separate counterparts (including facsimile and
other electronically transmitted counterparts), each of which shall be deemed

Employee; (ii) the Severance Payment Amount resulting from the Triggering
Event and the calculation thereof; (iii) the Escrow Reimbursable Amount
reimbursable to Buyer subject to disbursement pursuant to Section 7(a); and
(iv) a schedule setting forth the dates and amounts of all installments of
the Severance Payment Amount payable to such Employee resulting from such
Triggering Event. Buyer shall promptly provide to Parent any information
reasonably requested by Parent with respect to the preparation of such
Payment Notice and computation of any amounts contained therein. 
---|---|---

--- 

    



   | (b)| Parent shall have fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of a
Payment Notice to notify Buyer and the Escrow Agent in writing whether it
disputes the calculation of any amounts contained in the Payment Notice (a "
_Notice of Dispute_ "). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| If no Notice of Dispute is delivered with respect to such Payment
Notice (or there are undisputed Escrow Reimbursable Amounts contained in such
Payment Notice) within such fifteen (15) calendar day period or if Parent
delivers a written acceptance of such Payment Notice within such fifteen (15)
calendar day period, such Payment Notice (or such Payment Notice solely with
respect to any undisputed Escrow Reimbursable Amounts) shall be deemed to be a
" _Valid Payment Notice_ " for purposes of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| In the event that Parent delivers to Buyer a Notice of Dispute in
response to such Payment Notice, Buyer and Parent shall promptly consult and
cooperate with each other in good faith with respect to the points of
disagreement in an effort to resolve the dispute, and upon such resolution,
any adjustments to the Payment Notice shall be made as agreed upon in writing
between Buyer and Parent and, as so adjusted, such Payment Notice shall
constitute a " _Valid Payment Notice_ " for purposes of this Agreement, and
such Valid Payment Notice shall be promptly delivered to the Escrow Agent. If
Parent and Buyer cannot resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) calendar
days of delivery of the Notice of Dispute by Parent, then Parent and
Buyer shall jointly refer the dispute to the Arbiter, as an arbitrator, to
finally resolve, as soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30)
calendar days after such reference, all points of disagreement with respect to
the Payment Notice that is the subject of such Notice of Dispute. For
purposes of such arbitration each of Parent and the Buyer shall submit a
proposed Payment Notice (including each item referenced in the definition
thereof). The Arbiter shall apply the terms of this Agreement and
Section 5.2(a) of the Purchase Agreement and all relevant definitions
contained herein and therein, and shall otherwise conduct the
arbitration under such procedures as Parent and Buyer may agree or, failing
such agreement, under the then prevailing Commercial Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. Parent and the Buyer shall each furnish the Arbiter
with such work papers and other documents and information relating to the
disputed issues as the Arbiter shall request, and, subject to _Section 6.4_ of
the Purchase Agreement, shall provide copies to the other party of any work
papers, documents and information so furnished to the Arbiter. Each of Parent
and Buyer shall bear its own expenses in connection with the arbitration. The
fees and expenses of the Arbiter incurred in connection with any arbitration
pursuant to this provision shall be allocated between Parent and the Buyer by
the Arbiter in proportion to the extent either of such parties did not
prevail on items in dispute, as applicable, reflected on the Payment
Notice. The Arbiter may find a party liable for the other party's out-of-
pocket outside counsel and accounting fees in connection with any arbitration
pursuant to this provision in the case of failure to comply with the
procedures of this Section, willful misconduct, fraud or bad faith. Each of
Parent and Buyer agrees not to engage in any ex parte communication with the
Arbiter. All determinations by the Arbiter shall be final, conclusive and
binding with respect to the Payment Notice, the amounts set forth thereon and
the allocation of arbitration fees and expenses, in the absence of fraud or
manifest error. The Payment Notice as finally determined pursuant to the
resolution of the Arbiter pursuant to this _Section 6(d)_ shall be deemed to
be a " _Valid Payment Notice_ " for purposes of this Agreement.

   | 7.| _Disbursement of Escrow Funds; Release_. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Promptly and in no event more than five (5) days following (i)
such time as any Payment Notice (or undisputed Escrow Reimbursable Amounts
contained in such Payment Notice) is deemed to constitute a Valid Payment
Notice in accordance with the foregoing provisions of Section 6 or (ii) a
notice signed by both Parent and Buyer (a "Joint Notice") with directions to
the Escrow Agent as set forth in _Section 7(b)_ , the Escrow Agent shall
release to Buyer (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) an amount
(the " _Release Amount_ ") equal to the Escrow Reimbursable Amount that is
set forth in such Valid Payment Notice or Joint Notice, as applicable. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| On the date that is the earlier of (A) two years from the date of
this Agreement or (B) receipt by the Escrow Agent of a Joint Notice relating
to the disposition of all of the Escrow Assets, (the " _Release Date_ "), the
Escrow Agent shall release to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) an amount equal to (i) all remaining Escrow Assets _less_
(ii) any Release Amount that has been the subject of a Valid Payment Notice or
Joint Notice but has not yet been released to Buyer in accordance with
_Section 7(a)_ _less_ (iii) if any Payment Notice is outstanding and is the
subject of a dispute or has not otherwise been finalized pursuant to _Section
6_ hereof, an amount equal to what would be the Release Amount if such
Payment Notice was a Valid Payment Notice (" _Unresolved Claims_ "). After the
resolution of all Unresolved Claims, any remaining Escrow Assets shall be
released by the Escrow Agent to Parent. Parent and Buyer shall use their
respective reasonable efforts to resolve all disputes or claims as promptly as
possible following the Release Date. Payment pursuant to this Section 7(b)
shall be made as soon as practicable but in no event later than 5 calendar
days following the Release Date.

Annual Fee of $1,500 shall be payable fifty percent (50%) by Buyer, on the one

Agent on each anniversary of the date of this Escrow Agreement until this
escrow is terminated by distribution of all remaining Escrow Assets.

   | 11.| _Duties of Escrow Agent_. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The Escrow Agent shall be liable as a depository only with its
duties being only those specifically provided herein and which are
ministerial in nature and not discretionary. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for any mistake of fact or error in judgment, or for any acts or
failure to act of any kind taken in good faith and believed by it to be
authorized or within the rights or powers conferred by this Agreement, except
to the extent that such mistake, failure, action or omission constitutes
willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for the sufficiency or
accuracy of the form, execution or validity of the documents or items
deposited hereunder, nor for any description of property or other matter noted
therein. It shall not be liable for default by any party hereto because of
such party's failure to perform, and shall have no responsibility to seek
performance by any party; nor shall it be liable for the outlawing of any
rights under any statutes of limitation in respect to any documents or items
deposited. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for collection of items until
the proceeds of same in actual cash have been received. The Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for interest on any deposit of money. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of
identity, authority or rights of persons executing or delivering, or
purporting to execute or deliver, any document or item, and may rely
absolutely and be fully protected in acting upon any item, document or other
writing believed by it to be authentic in performing its duties
hereunder. The Escrow Agent may, as a condition to the disbursement of money
or property, require from the payee or recipient a receipt therefor, and,
upon final payment or distribution, require a release from any liability
arising out of its execution or performance of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| The Escrow Agent shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
parties to this Agreement from and against all costs, damages, liabilities
and expenses which the Escrow Agent may incur or sustain without willful
misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in connection with or arising out
of this Escrow Agreement, including, but not limited to, any reasonable and
necessary costs, damages, liabilities and expenses that may be incurred as a
result of claims or actions by third parties. Fifty percent (50%) of any such
indemnification obligation is to be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and fifty
percent (50%) by Parent, on the other hand. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to consult with and engage the services of legal counsel of its
choice with respect to any matter pertaining to this Escrow Agreement and
shall be entitled to reimbursement for the reasonable and necessary costs and
expenses of such legal counsel.

reimbursement for its services and documented out-of-pocket expenses, which
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer, on the one hand and fifty percent
(50%) by Parent, on the other hand. In the event any such amounts remain
unpaid 60 days after billing, then the Escrow Agent shall have the right to
reimburse itself out of any funds in its possession for reasonable and
necessary costs, expenses, attorney's fees and its compensation, and shall
have a lien on all money, documents or property held in escrow to cover same. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| The Escrow Agent may resign by giving notice in writing to Parent
and Buyer of such resignation, specifying a date which such resignation shall
take effect (which shall in no event be earlier than thirty (30) calendar days
after the giving of such notice), and shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations upon the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent as hereafter
provided and the delivery to such successor of the Escrow Assets, less any
undisputed fees, expenses, and charges then due and owing to the Escrow
Agent. Immediately upon receipt of such notice, Parent and Buyer shall appoint
a successor Escrow Agent who shall be mutually acceptable to them. Any such
successor Escrow Agent shall deliver to Parent and Buyer and to the
resigning Escrow Agent a written instrument accepting such appointment
hereunder, and thereupon it shall succeed to all the rights and duties of the
Escrow Agent hereunder, and shall be entitled to receive the Escrow Assets. In
the event that a successor Escrow Agent shall not be so appointed by the date
of resignation specified by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall have the
right to (i) appoint as a successor Escrow Agent any financial institution
having capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than
$100,000,000 or (ii) apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, and the parties hereto agree to
accept any such successor Escrow Agent appointed by the Escrow Agent. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| In accepting any funds, securities or documents delivered
hereunder, it is agreed and understood that, in the event of disagreement
among Parent and Buyer, or persons claiming under them, or any of them, the
Escrow Agent reserves the right to hold all money, securities and property in
its possession, and all papers in connection with or concerning this
escrow, until receipt of a Joint Notice, or until delivery is made to court
in any interpleader action. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.| _Addresses of Parties; Notices_. Notices shall be deemed to have
been received on the same day as faxed or submitted by electronic e-mail
transmission, the date of actual delivery by courier, the next day if sent by
overnight express delivery, or on the third business day following posting if
sent by first class mail. Whenever payments, instructions, notices, releases
or any other documents are required to be given by or to the parties hereto,
they shall be sent by fax, courier, express delivery or post-paid first class

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of March
[_______], 2014, by and between ESCO Technologies Holding LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Parent_ ", and, together with its Affiliates,
the " _ESCO Parties_ ")) and Meter Readings Holding, LLC, a Delaware limited

including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, the " _Buyer Parties_ ").

  



  

 _WITNESSETH_

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties hereto have entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement
dated March [_____], 2014 (as amended from time to time, the " _Purchase
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Parent agreed, among other things, to sell
and Buyer agreed to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of
Aclara Technologies LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (the " _Company_
"), as more fully described in the Purchase Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, prior to the Closing Date, the ESCO Parties performed certain
services for the Company and Company Subsidiaries, and the Company and
Company Subsidiaries performed certain services for the ESCO Parties; and

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Parent and the Buyer have agreed
to enter into this Agreement on the Closing Date in order to provide for the
provision of certain transitional services in connection with the divestiture
and sale of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries from Parent or its
Affiliate to the Buyer, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements
and covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Services to be Provided_.

  



  

(a) During the Transition Period (as defined below) (or such shorter periods

Service), Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided by an Affiliate) to
the Buyer the services described on _Schedule A_ (the " _Parent Services_ ")
for the benefit of the operation of the Business.

  



  

(b) During the Transition Period (as defined below) (or such shorter periods
as may be specified in _Schedule B_ with respect to any Buyer Service), the
Buyer shall provide (or cause to be provided by an Affiliate (including the
Company)) to the Parent or its Affiliates the services described on _Schedule

(f) All equipment, including computers, peripheral equipment and procedure
manuals, used by Provider or its Affiliates in connection with the
provision of Services (other than any such items being the property of
Recipient that are provided by Recipient or its Affiliates to Provider to
facilitate Provider's provision of the Services to Recipient (such items, the
" _Recipient Owned Items_ ," which shall include, without limitation, those
items identified as such on _Schedule A_ or _Schedule B_ hereto))
hereunder shall, as between the Provider and Recipient, be the property of
Provider or such Affiliate and shall at all times be under the sole direction
and control of Provider or such Affiliate. Promptly following the expiration
of the Transition Period with respect to a specified Service, all Recipient
Owned Items utilized in connection with such Service shall be returned to the
possession of the Recipient.

  



  

2. _Consideration for Services_. 

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in _Schedule A_ or
_Schedule B_ hereto, Recipient shall pay to Provider a fee for the
Services (or category of Services, as applicable) as provided in _Schedule A_
(with respect to the Parent Services) or _Schedule B_ (with respect to the
Buyer Services) (each such fee constituting a " _Service Charge_ "). Out-of-
pocket costs paid to any third-party provider that is providing goods or
services used by Provider in providing the applicable Services and any Taxes,
imposed under Law on the provision of such Services (but not on any income of
Provider received in connection with provision of such services) will be an
incremental cost to Recipient in addition to the Service Charges, and will be
charged to Recipient at the actual third-party cost or amount of Taxes so
imposed. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense.

(b) Provider shall deliver invoices to Recipient on a monthly basis,
beginning approximately one month after the Closing Date, and, thereafter,
at the end of each succeeding month for the duration of this Agreement in
arrears for the Service Charges due to Provider under this Agreement.
Provider agrees to afford Recipient, upon reasonable notice, access to such
information, records and documentation of Provider as Recipient may
reasonably request in order to verify any invoices and charges for Services
hereunder.

  



  

(c) Recipient shall pay the amount of such invoice within thirty (30)
calendar days of the date of receipt of such invoice to the account
specified by Provider.

  



  

3. _Standard for Service_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or _Schedule A_ or _Schedule B_ hereto, as applicable, Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perform each Service such that the nature, quality, standard of care, level of priority and the service level at which such Service is performed is comparable to the nature, quality, standard of care, level of priority and service level at which Provider performs similar services on its own behalf or for its Affiliates, and in any event consistent in all material respects with the operation of such Business or Parent Business, respectively, during the twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

4. _Force Majeure_.  Provider shall not be responsible for failure or delay in delivery of any Service if prohibited by Law or caused by an act of god or public enemy, war, terrorism, government acts or regulations, fire, flood, embargo, quarantine, epidemic, unusually severe weather or other cause similar to the foregoing, in each case which is beyond their reasonable control (a " _Force Majeure Event_ "). A party's obligations hereunder (except their payment obligations in respect of Services already provided) shall be postponed for such time as its performance is suspended or delayed on account of the Force Majeure Event, and upon the cessation of the Force Majeure Event, such party will use commercially reasonable efforts to resume its performance hereunder.

  



  

5. _Confidential Information_. 

  



  

(a) Each of the Buyer and Parent, shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
maintain in confidence any information or communications coming into its or
any such Affiliate's possession pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement (" _Confidential Information_ "), and such Confidential Information
shall not be disclosed or used (except as contemplated by this Agreement) by
the Person receiving such Confidential Information (the " _Receiving Party_
") or its Affiliates without the prior written consent of the Person
disclosing such Confidential Information (the " _Disclosing Party_ "), unless
such information is (x) otherwise publicly available through no breach by the
Receiving Party or its Affiliates of this _Section 5(a)_ or (y) required to
be disclosed pursuant to any Law or Order applicable to the Receiving Party or
its Affiliates, in which event the Receiving Party shall provide the
Disclosing Party with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient
to enable the Disclosing Party to either seek a protective order, at its
expense, or other appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such
disclosure (and the Receiving Party shall reasonably cooperate with the
Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party's expense, in seeking any such
protective order or other appropriate remedy) or to waive compliance with the
provisions of this _Section 5(a)_ or both. In the event that such protective
order or other appropriate remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall
furnish only that portion of such information or documentation that has been
legally compelled, and shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain
assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such disclosed
documents or information. The Receiving Party hereby agrees, and shall cause
its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates' Representatives, to protect the
Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party by using the same
degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent
the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information disclosed by
the Disclosing Party as the Receiving Party uses to protect its own
confidential information of a like nature

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach of this
_Section 5_, the harm to the Parties will be irreparable and
without adequate remedy at law and therefore that injunctive relief with
respect thereto will be appropriate.

  



  

6. _Ownership of Data_. Recipient shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all data or other information about its business generated in connection with the provision of the Services (collectively, " _Recipient Data_ "). Provider hereby assigns all right, title and interest in and to the Recipient Data to Recipient, and Recipient hereby grants to Provider a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, limited license to use the Recipient Data during the Transition Period, solely to the extent required to provide the Services and thereafter solely to the extent required to comply with Provider's bona fide record retention policies and then only for bona fide archival, legal, audit and compliance purposes.

  



  

7. _Term and Termination_.

  



  

(a) The term of this Agreement (the " _Transition Period_ ") shall commence
on the Closing Date and continue with respect to each of the Services for the
term thereof, which term shall, unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the
Buyer in _Schedule A_ or _Schedule B_ , as applicable, terminate six (6)
months following the Closing Date; _provided_ that except as otherwise
specified on any Schedule hereto (i) Recipient may terminate one or more of
the Services it receives at any time and for any reason on not less than
fifteen (15) calendar days prior written notice to Provider; and (ii) both
parties may terminate this Agreement with respect to one or more Services, or
the entire Agreement, immediately upon mutual agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each party reserves the right to immediately terminate this
Agreement by written notice to the other in the event that the other
party breaches or is in default of any material obligation under this
Agreement and such breach or default remains uncured for fifteen (15) days
after receipt of written notice from the non-breaching party, provided that a
breach of _Section_ 5 hereof shall not be subject to such cure period.

  



  

(b) Upon the effective date of termination of any Service pursuant to this
Agreement, Provider will have no further obligation to provide the
terminated Service. Recipient shall remain obligated to Provider for the
Service Charges and any other fees, costs and expenses owed and payable in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement in respect of Services provided
and otherwise as provided in _Schedule A_ or  _Schedule B_ , as applicable.
In connection with termination of any Service, the provisions of this
Agreement not relating solely to such terminated Service shall survive any
such termination.

(c) Any termination of this Agreement with respect to any one or more
Services shall not terminate this Agreement with respect to any other
Service then being provided pursuant to this Agreement. The failure of either
party to terminate this Agreement for breach of any term or condition shall
not constitute a waiver of such breach and shall not affect such party's right
to terminate this Agreement by reason of subsequent breaches of the same or
other terms or conditions.

  



  

8. _Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability_.

  



  

(a) EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 3, PROVIDER MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED

REQUIRED TO PAY ANY SUCH AMOUNTS TO A THIRD PARTY, IN EACH CASE ARISING FROM
ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED

REPRESENTATIVES. FURTHER, EXCEPT FOR A PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT, THE LIABILITY OF SUCH PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY AND/OR ITS
AFFILIATES FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH PROVIDING THE
SERVICES HEREUNDER SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT BILLED OR BILLABLE TO
SUCH PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE LIMITATIONS
SET FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH 8(C) SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY AMOUNTS OWED ON THE
SUBJECT CREDIT CARDS (AS DEFINED IN SCHEDULE A) WITH RESPECT TO COSTS INCURRED
DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD, WHICH SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BUYER.

(a) Except to the extent otherwise provided for in this Agreement, Recipient

employees, officers, directors and Affiliates against any Losses which such

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is expressly

(A) notify Buyer prior to making payment in respect of a Guarantee Demand
or (B) comply with _Section 2(e)_ , and (ii) the obligation of the Company to
pay all amounts due hereunder pursuant to _Section 2(b)_ is a continuing,
absolute and unconditional obligation under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and shall remain in full force and effect, subject to _Section
2(g)_ , until the expiration of the Guarantee Period and the payment of all
amounts due hereunder as Reimbursement Amounts, it being the purpose and
intent of this Agreement that the obligation of the Company hereunder shall
not be affected, modified or impaired upon the happening from time to time of
any event, including without limitation any Sale Transaction Closing.
Accordingly, the obligations of the Company to pay all amounts due hereunder
pursuant to _Section 2(b)_  hereof shall not be subject to reduction,
impairment, limitation or termination by reason of any claim or defense or
rescission, termination, cancellation, or recoupment or for any other reason.

obligated to provide any report, correspondence or other information under
this  _Section 2_ to the extent that it is reasonably likely to result in the
loss of ESCO's ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege (including
attorney-client or work product privileges) with respect thereto, unless Buyer
and the Company enter into a mutually acceptable (such acceptance not to be
unreasonably withheld) valid joint defense agreement or similar
arrangement to preserve such privilege.

In no event shall ESCO or any of its Affiliates be required to enter into or execute any guarantee of any Liability or obligation of the Company or any of its Affiliates after the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company take any action to extend the term of, or to renew or permit the renewal of, any Vendor Contract or Lease Contract during the period in which the ESCO Guarantee relating to such Vendor Contract or Lease Contract remains outstanding._

Business Days after the date on which Buyer receives such Notice of Claim ("

Date of Receipt (or if such day is not a Business Day, then the next
succeeding Business Day), the Escrow Agent shall release to ESCO an amount of
Escrow Assets equal to the Claimed Amount. If Buyer delivers to the Escrow
Agent and ESCO a written objection (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Notice of
Claim within ten (10) Business Days following the Date of Receipt, the Escrow
Agent shall continue to hold in escrow the Claimed Amount stated in

shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5) calendar days after
such receipt) release to ESCO the portion of the Escrow Assets subject to the
Dispute Notice in accordance with such Joint Instruction or Directive. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The parties acknowledge that ESCO may give multiple Notices of
Claim during the term hereof. 
---|---|---

   | 10.| _Duties of Escrow Agent_. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The Escrow Agent shall be liable as a depository only with its
duties being only those specifically provided herein and which are
ministerial in nature and not discretionary. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for any mistake of fact or error in judgment, or for any acts or
failure to act of any kind taken in good faith and believed by it to be
authorized or within the rights or powers conferred by this Agreement, except
to the extent that such mistake, failure, action or omission constitutes
willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for the sufficiency or
accuracy of the form, execution or validity of the documents or items
deposited hereunder, nor for any description of property or other matter noted
therein. It shall not be liable for default by any party hereto because of
such party's failure to perform, and shall have no responsibility to seek
performance by any party; nor shall it be liable for the outlawing of any
rights under any statutes of limitation in respect to any documents or items
deposited. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for collection of items until
the proceeds of same in actual cash have been received. The Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for interest on any deposit of money. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of
identity, authority or rights of persons executing or delivering, or
purporting to execute or delivery, any document or item, and may rely
absolutely and be fully protected in acting upon any item, document or other
writing believed by it to be authentic in performing its duties
hereunder. The Escrow Agent may, as a condition to the disbursement of money
or property, require from the payee or recipient a receipt therefor, and,

   | (d)| The Escrow Agent shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
parties to this Agreement from and against all costs, damages, liabilities
and expenses which the Escrow Agent may incur or sustain without willful
misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in connection with or arising out
of this Escrow Agreement, including, but not limited to, any reasonable and
necessary costs, damages, liabilities and expenses that may be incurred as a
result of claims or actions by third parties. Fifty percent (50%) of any such
indemnification obligation is to be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and fifty
percent (50%) by ESCO, on the other hand. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled

respect to any matter pertaining to this Escrow Agreement and shall be
entitled to reimbursement for the reasonable and necessary costs and expenses
of such legal counsel. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to reasonable compensation and
reimbursement for its services and documented out-of-pocket expenses (the "
_Agent Compensation_ "), which shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer,
on the one hand and fifty percent (50%) by ESCO, on the other hand. In the
event any such amounts remain unpaid 60 days after billing, then the Escrow
Agent shall have the right to reimburse itself out of any funds in its
possession for reasonable and necessary costs, expenses, attorney's fees and
its compensation, and shall have a lien on all money, documents or
property held in escrow to cover same; provided, that, to the extent that any
unpaid Agent Compensation is so reimbursed from the Escrow Account, the party
originally liable for such Agent Compensation shall promptly deposit such
amount into the Escrow Account, and the other party shall be entitled to
recover from such liable party any costs incurred to enforce such obligation. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| The Escrow Agent may resign by giving notice in writing to ESCO
and Buyer of such resignation, specifying a date which such resignation shall
take effect (which shall in no event be earlier than thirty (30) calendar days
after the giving of such notice), and shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations upon the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent as hereafter
provided and the delivery to such successor of the Escrow Assets, less any
undisputed fees, expenses, and charges then due and owing to the Escrow
Agent. Immediately upon receipt of such notice, ESCO and Buyer shall appoint a
successor Escrow Agent who shall be mutually acceptable to them. Any such
successor Escrow Agent shall deliver to ESCO and Buyer and to the
resigning Escrow Agent a written instrument accepting such appointment
hereunder, and thereupon it shall succeed to all the rights and duties of the
Escrow Agent hereunder, and shall be entitled to receive the Escrow Assets. In
the event that a successor Escrow Agent shall not be so appointed by the date
of resignation specified by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall have the
right to (i) appoint as a successor Escrow Agent any financial institution
having capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than
$100,000,000 or (ii) apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, and the parties hereto agree to
accept any such successor Escrow Agent appointed by the Escrow Agent.

   | (g)| In accepting any funds, securities or documents delivered
hereunder, it is agreed and understood that, in the event of disagreement
among ESCO and Buyer, or persons claiming under them, or any of them, the
Escrow Agent reserves the right to hold all money, securities and property in
its possession, and all papers in connection with or concerning this
escrow, until receipt of a Joint Instruction, or until delivery is made to
court in any interpleader action.

WAIVER AND RELEASE AGREEMENT

  



  

This Waiver and Release Agreement (the " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of
____________ _____, 2014, by and between ESCO Technologies Holding LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Parent_ "), Aclara Technologies LLC, an
Ohio limited liability company (the " _Company_ "), Aclara International LLC,
a Missouri limited liability company (the " _Missouri Subsidiary_ ") and
Distribution Control Systems Caribe, Inc., a Puerto Rico corporation (the "
_Puerto Rico Subsidiary_ " and with the Missouri Subsidiary, the " _Company
Subsidiaries_ ")) and Meter Readings Holding, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Buyer_ " and, together with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, the " _Releasing Parties_ "). Capitalized terms used
herein but not defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Purchase
Agreement.

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent and Buyer have entered into that certain Securities Purchase
Agreement dated as of March [●], 2014 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), which
provides for the purchase by the Buyer from Parent of all of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of the Company and Company Subsidiaries; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Section 8.4(e) of the Purchase Agreement requires that a release of
the officers, directors and managers, as applicable, of each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Liability or claims
related to service at or prior to their resignation be executed and delivered
by Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as a condition precedent to
the obligations of Parent under the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

AGREEMENT

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the recitals and the covenants,
representations, warranties, conditions and agreement hereinafter expressed,
the parties agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Acknowledgements_. Each Releasing Party recognizes that the agreements and covenants set forth in this Agreement are an essential part of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and that but for the agreement of the Releasing Parties to comply with the agreements and covenants in this Agreement, Parent would not enter into the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

2. _Certain Waivers and Releases_. Effective upon the Closing, each Releasing Party, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, forever releases and discharges each of the officers, directors and managers, as applicable, of each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 1 hereto (the " _Released Individuals_ ") from any and all Liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever, related to each such Released Individual's service as an officer, director, manager, fiduciary, attorney, representative or agent of the Company, the Company's predecessors or any of the Company Subsidiaries for the period on and prior to the Closing, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, and whether arising under any agreement or understanding or otherwise at law or equity (collectively, the " _Released Claims_ "). Each Releasing Party, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, agrees that it shall not seek to recover any amounts in connection with a Released Claim from the Released Individuals or Parent or any of its Affiliates and shall not institute any claim, action or proceeding against the Released Individual or Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Released Claims. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH RELEASING PARTY waives the benefit of any provision of APPLICABLE law to the effect that a general release does not extend to claims which the releasing party did not know or suspect to exist in the releasing party's favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by the releasing party may have affected his or her release of the released INDIVIDUALS.

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

3. _Remedies_. If any Releasing Party has breached the covenants set forth in _Section 2_ of this Agreement, the Released Individuals will be entitled to seek the following remedies: (a) any damages, costs, expenses or losses suffered by such Released Individual with respect to such breach; and (b) injunctive or equitable relief, without the necessity of posting a bond, to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce the provisions of _Section 2_ of this Agreement, it being agreed that money damages alone may be inadequate to compensate the Released Individuals and may be an inadequate remedy for such breach.

  



  

4. _Waiver of Rights_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies under Law. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law: (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

5. _Notice_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder shall be in writing and delivered personally or sent by telecopy or prepaid overnight courier, if to:
