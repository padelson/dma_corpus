CONSIDERATION

3.1

  |  

Upfront Payment and Milestone Payments

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

3.1.1

  |  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Seller at Closing, in
consideration of the aforesaid sale, transfer and assignment of the
Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, $97,500,000
(such amount, the "Upfront Payment"), plus the Prepaid Amounts and the
Milestone Payments for any Milestone Events that have been achieved prior to
the Closing. Payment of the Upfront Payment, the Prepaid Amounts and the
Milestone Payments for the Milestone Events that have been achieved prior to
the Closing shall be made in accordance with Section 12.4.2 and by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as shall have
been notified in writing to the Purchaser by the Seller.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

3.1.2

  |  

Promptly following (but no more than 30 days after) the first achievement of
each event described on _Schedule_3.1.2 (each, a "Milestone Event"), the
Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, as additional consideration hereunder, an
amount set forth opposite the applicable Milestone Event (each, a "Milestone
Payment") in accordance with Section 12.4.2 and by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such bank account as shall have been notified
in writing to the Purchaser by the Seller not less than three days in advance
of the date of payment, provided, however, if any Milestone Event is achieved
prior to the Closing and the Seller notifies the Purchaser of such achievement
at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then the applicable
Milestone Payment(s) shall be due and payable by the Purchaser at Closing. For
the avoidance of doubt, the maximum aggregate value of all Milestone Payments
payable by the Purchaser in accordance with this Section 3.1.2 is $27,500,000.
Each Milestone Payment shall be payable only upon the first achievement of the
applicable Milestone Event and no amounts shall be due for subsequent or
repeated achievements of the Milestone Event.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

3.1.3

  |  

Commencing upon the Closing Date and ending upon the date that all Milestone
Events have been achieved, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates, to use Diligent Efforts to achieve each Milestone Event.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

3.1.4

  |  

From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller
promptly, but in no event later than five Business Days following the
achievement of each Milestone Event (if any). If, notwithstanding the fact
that the Purchaser has not provided the Seller such a notice, the Seller
believes that a Milestone Event has been achieved, it shall so notify the
Purchaser in writing and the Parties shall meet promptly and discuss in good
faith whether the applicable Milestone Event has been achieved.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

3.1.5

  |  

If the Purchaser and its Affiliates, taken as a whole, shall no longer engage
in the activities required to achieve the Milestone Events, then the Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, send written notice thereof to the
Seller together with a detailed explanation for such cessation of activities
(provided, however, that any such notice given by Purchaser or its Affiliates
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 12.3).

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

3.1.6

  |  

The right of Seller to receive the Milestone Payments (a) is solely a
contractual right and is not a security for purposes of any federal or state
securities laws (and shall confer upon the Seller only the rights of a general
unsecured creditor under applicable state Law); (b) will not be represented by
any form of certificate or instrument; and (c) does not give the Seller any
dividend rights, voting rights, liquidation rights, pre-emptive rights or
other similar rights including, without limitation, any rights with respect to
the operation or conduct of any Transferred Asset from and after the Closing.

3.2

  |  

Real Property Pro-Rations

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

3.2.1

  |  

The following shall be apportioned with respect to the Owned Real Property and
the Seller Leased Real Property as of 12:01 a.m., Eastern time, on the day of
Closing, as if the Purchaser were vested with fee simple title or leasehold
title to the Owned Real Property or Seller Leased Real Property, respectively,
during the entire day upon which Closing occurs: (a) rents, if any, as and
when paid or collected (the term "rents" as used herein shall mean all
payments due and payable by tenants under the Transferred Leases); (b) Taxes
levied against the Owned Real Property or that are the responsibility of
Seller under the Transferred Leases; (c) gas, electricity and other utility
charges for which the Seller is liable, if any, such charges to be apportioned
at Closing on the basis of the most recent meter reading occurring prior to
Closing; and (d) any other operating expenses or other items pertaining to the
Owned Real Property or that are the responsibility of Seller under the
Transferred Leases which are customarily prorated between a purchaser and a
seller in the area in which the Owned Real Property or Seller Leased Real
Property is located.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

3.2.2

  |  

Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3.2.1: Any Taxes (excluding any
Transfer Taxes) levied against the Owned Real Property or any personal
property Taxes paid at or prior to Closing shall be prorated based upon the
amounts actually paid. If such Taxes for the current year have not been paid
before Closing, Seller shall be charged at Closing an amount equal to that
portion of such Taxes which relates to the period before Closing and Purchaser
shall pay such Taxes prior to their becoming delinquent. Any such
apportionment made with respect to a tax year for which the tax rate or
assessed valuation, or both, have not yet been fixed shall be based upon the
tax rate or assessed valuation last fixed. To the extent that the actual Owned
Real Property Taxes for the current year differ from the amount apportioned at
Closing, the parties shall make all necessary adjustments by appropriate
payments between themselves within 12 months following Closing. Nothing
described in this Section 3.2.2 shall include Taxes that arise pursuant to
entering into this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

3.3

  |  

Prepaid Amounts

   
---|--- 
  

  

At the Closing, in consideration for the Prepaid Items existing as of the
Closing Date and in accordance with Section 3.1.1, the Purchaser shall pay the
Seller an amount equal to the Prepaid Amounts. The Seller shall notify the
Purchaser of the Prepaid Amounts at least three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

  

    

3.4

  |  

Allocation of the Purchase Price

   
---|--- 
  

  

The allocation of the Purchase Price among the Transferred Assets sold by the
Seller (the "Allocation") shall be determined as set forth in this Section
3.4. The Allocation shall be in a form consistent with Form 8594, Asset
Acquisition Statement under Section 1060 of the Code. Each of the Seller, on
the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other, will (a) be bound by the
Allocation for purposes of determining any Taxes, and cause their Affiliates
to determine any Taxes consistent with the Allocation; (b) prepare and file,
and cause their respective Affiliates to prepare and file, all Tax Returns on
a basis consistent with the Allocation; and (c) take no position, and cause
their respective Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the
Allocation on any applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding before any taxing
authority or otherwise. Attached hereto as _Schedule_3.4 is the Seller\'s
proposed Allocation (the "Seller\'s Allocation"). If the Purchaser disagrees
with the Seller\'s Allocation, the Purchaser may, within 30 days after the
Closing Date, deliver a written notice (the "Allocation Objection Notice") to
the Seller specifying those items set forth in the Seller\'s Allocation as to
which the Purchaser disagrees, describing the disagreement and setting forth
the Purchaser\'s proposed Allocation, which shall be consistent with Section
1060 of the Code. If the Allocation Objection Notice is duly delivered, then
the Seller and the Purchaser shall, during the 15 days following such
delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts. If the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to reach
such agreement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall promptly thereafter cause
an independent accounting firm or other independent expert (an "Independent
Expert") to resolve any remaining disputes in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code and this Section 3.4, and the cost of such Independent Expert shall
be borne equally between the Seller and the Purchaser. If no Allocation
Objection Notice is duly and timely delivered, then the Seller\'s Allocation
as prepared by the Seller and as may be adjusted as herein provided in this
Section 3.4 shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. In the event that
the Seller\'s Allocation is disputed by any Governmental Authority, the Party
receiving notice of the dispute will promptly notify the other Party hereto,
and the Seller and Purchaser agree to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to defend such Allocation in any audit or similar Legal Proceeding. In
the event of an adjustment to the Purchase Price due to a Milestone Payment or
any adjustment to the amount of the Prepaid Amounts, in each case, as set
forth above, then the Allocation will be revised to reflect such Milestone
Payment or the adjustment to the amount of the Prepaid Amounts.

  

    

3.5

  |  

No Duplicative Adjustments or Payments

   
---|--- 
  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not be entitled to any
duplicative reimbursement or adjustments to the Purchase Price or duplicative
payments for Excluded Accounts Receivable, Prepaid Amounts, or any amounts
under Section 3.2 or Section 7.5, to the extent that the Seller or any of its
Affiliates has been compensated for such amounts pursuant to another provision
of this Agreement, the Transitional Services Agreement or the Pre-Novation
Agreement.

Canton, Massachusetts, at 10 a.m. (local time) on the fifth Business Day after
the end of the calendar month during which the last condition to Closing set
forth in Article 5 shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those

to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or the waiver
of those conditions) or at such other place and time and on such other day as
shall be mutually agreed upon in writing by the Parties (the "Closing Date").
The Closing shall take place by delivery of the documents to be delivered at
Closing by facsimile or other electronic transmission, followed by delivery of
original documents by overnight delivery unless otherwise mutually agreed by
the Parties; provided, however, that Closing with respect to the Owned Real
Property shall be in escrow at the Boston office of Commonwealth Land Title
Insurance Company, which shall act solely in its capacity as escrow agent for
the sale and transfer of the Owned Real Property under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. All deliveries by one Party to any other Party at the
Closing shall be deemed to have occurred simultaneously and none shall be
effective until and unless all have occurred, unless the Parties agree
otherwise. The Closing shall be deemed to have occurred at 12:01 a.m., Eastern
time, on the Closing Date; such that the Purchaser shall be deemed the owner
of the Transferred Assets on and after the Closing Date.

(ii)

  |  

fail to maintain the insurance coverage with respect thereto as in effect on
the Execution Date;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

enter into a Contract for the purchase, sale or lease of any Facilities or

6.2.1

  |  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill, or cause to

  |  

As promptly as possible after the Execution Date, the Purchaser and, where
applicable, the Seller shall make such notifications, filings and submissions

Notifications shall be made in a timely manner and in full compliance with

---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

the Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of all filing and other
fees and expenses in connection with the Required Notifications and obtaining
the Antitrust Approval(s);

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

without limiting the generality of the Purchaser\'s covenants otherwise set
out in this Section 6.2.2, [***];

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(d)

  |  

to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party shall promptly notify
the other of any communication (including oral communications) it or any of
its Affiliates receives from any Antitrust Authority relating to the matters
that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other to review in
advance any proposed communication by such Party to any Antitrust Authority.
To the extent permitted by applicable Law, neither of the Parties shall
participate in or agree to participate in any meeting with any Antitrust
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement
of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry related to the Required
Notifications unless it consults with the other in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Antitrust Authority, gives the other the opportunity to
attend and participate at such meeting. Each Party will coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods
under any applicable antitrust or competition Laws. Subject always to the
provisions of Section 12.1, the Parties will provide each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
representatives, on the one hand, and any Antitrust Authority or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that materials may be
redacted: (i) by the Seller to remove references concerning valuation of the
Transferred Assets; (ii) by either Party as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements; and (iii) by either Party as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or attorney work product privileges or waivers of

Parties\' respective abilities to obtain the Antitrust Approval(s).

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

6.2.3

  |  

Nothing in this Section 6.2 will under any circumstances purport to require
either Party to do, or omit to do, any act which would, in its reasonable
opinion, put it in breach of any applicable Laws or regulations relating to
anti-bribery, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the
UK Bribery Act 2010.

   
---|---

threats are made, following the Execution Date against the Purchaser or the
Seller or their respective Affiliates which relate to the Transferred Assets
or Assumed Liabilities, or (b) commenced or threatened in writing against the

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

    

6.4

  |  

Subsequent Disclosures

   
---|--- 
  

  

Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, in the event that the Seller
or its Affiliates (in their sole reasonable discretion) notify the Purchaser
of any matter, event or fact that would reasonably be expected by the Seller
or its Affiliates to result in the non-fulfillment of the condition precedent
set forth in Section 5.2(a) (a "Subsequent Event"), then the Purchaser shall
have the right to refuse to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, provided, however, that if the Purchaser agrees to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then the Purchaser shall not be
entitled to any indemnification under Article 10 with respect to such

Regulatory Matters

Until the Closing Date, the Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser of any
calls made to or received from, or correspondence or other documents submitted

respect of the Transferred Product Regulatory Documentation or Transferred
Regulatory Approvals or any events resulting in any Product (a) not being
manufactured in accordance with the Master Production and Control Record
(within the meaning of 21 CFR part 211.186) and not being managed in
accordance with standard operating procedure [***] or standard operating
procedure [***], as applicable or (b) not meeting the Certificate of Analysis
applicable to the category type of Inventory in its stage of manufacture. The
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Purchaser
participate (with such participation by Purchaser to be limited to listening)
in any calls with Governmental Authorities relating to or otherwise in respect
of the Transferred Product Regulatory Documentation or Transferred Regulatory
Approvals.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

6.5.2

  |  

Except as otherwise set forth on _Schedule 6.5.2_ , the Seller shall provide

otherwise in respect of the Transferred Product Regulatory Documentation or
Transferred Regulatory Approvals for the Purchaser to review and comment upon
any correspondence or other documents in respect of the Transferred Product
Regulatory Documentation or Transferred Regulatory Approvals and shall in good
faith incorporate any such comments of the Purchaser into such correspondence
or other documents. For clarity, the Seller shall have final decision-making
authority regarding the contents of any submission or transmission to any
Governmental Authority in respect of the Transferred Product Regulatory
Documentation or Transferred Regulatory Approvals pursuant to this Section
6.5.2.

(the "Eligible Employees").

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

6.6.2

  |  

As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than 10 Business Days
after the Execution Date, the Seller shall notify the Eligible Employees of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and that each Eligible Employee
will receive an offer of employment from the Purchaser as hereinafter
provided, with copies of such letters being provided contemporaneously to the
Purchaser. At least 10 Business Days after, but in no event more than 20
Business Days after, the Execution Date, the Purchaser shall make an offer of
employment, effective as of the Closing Date, to each Eligible Employee,
provided that in no event shall the Purchaser be required to provide an offer
of employment to more than [***] Eligible Employees. Each such offer can be
conditioned on the Eligible Employee remaining employed by the Seller or one
of its Affiliates as of the Closing Date. The Seller and the Purchaser shall
cooperate with one another reasonably to facilitate such offers of employment
by the Purchaser, including the Seller providing the Purchaser with the
information necessary to make such offers of employment to the Eligible
Employees. Except as set forth on _Schedule_6.6.2, each such offer shall be
made so that, on the Closing Date, such Eligible Employee shall be employed by
the Purchaser under terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate in terms
of [***], with benefits as set forth on _Schedule_7.6.1, and with duties that
are similar to the duties now being performed by such Transferred Employees to
those under which such Transferred Employees are employed as of the Execution
Date by the Seller or its Affiliates. In addition, each such offer shall be
sufficient so as not to constitute a constructive discharge for purposes of
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and similar state
laws.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

6.7

  |  

Termination of Intra-Group Agreements

   
---|--- 
  

  

Effective as of the Closing, the Seller shall terminate, and shall (as the
case may be) cause its Affiliates to terminate, at its own cost and expenses,
and only to the extent they relate exclusively to the Manufacturing Facility,
the Contracts among them pertaining to the Manufacturing Facility other than
as set forth in _Schedule_6.7. The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Purchaser and its Affiliates from any claim of any Affiliate of the Seller
in connection with the termination of Contracts referenced in this Section 6.7
other than as set forth in _Schedule_6.7.

  

    

6.8

  |  

CDC Agreement

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

6.8.1

  |  

Prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide reasonable cooperation
in support of the Seller\'s disclosure to the contracting officer of the CDC
Agreement (and Responsible Contracting Officer, if different, and such other
U.S. Government officials as the Seller in its discretion deems prudent to
facilitate obtaining consent to subcontract or novation), in confidence, of
information regarding the transaction contemplated hereunder including the
parties\' intent to request the U.S. Government\'s recognition of the
Purchaser as a successor in interest to Seller for performance of the CDC
Agreement.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

6.8.2

  |

whichever occurs first. Seller shall make the disclosure required by Section
6.8.1 no later than such time as it makes the consent request.

Title Insurance; Zoning Report and Survey

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

6.9.1

  |  

The Seller has previously delivered to the Purchaser (a) a Commitment for
Title Insurance, effective January 17, 2017 (the "Title Commitment") to be
issued by Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company") and
(b) a survey of the Owned Real Property, dated as of February 21, 2017 (the
"Survey"); provided that Seller acknowledges that the Title Company and
surveyor for the Survey are and will be agents for Purchaser and Purchaser
shall be permitted to communicate and engage with the Title Company and
surveyor following the Execution Date and shall keep the Seller\'s counsel
reasonably informed with respect to such communications. The Purchaser will be
responsible for the costs and expenses associated with the preparation of the
Title Commitment, the Survey and any updates or supplements to the Title
Commitment or to the Survey. The Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge that the
Purchaser may, at the Purchaser\'s sole cost and expense, engage the Planning
and Zoning Resources Company or similar reputable provider to prepare a zoning
report summarizing zoning compliance of the Owned Real Property (the "Zoning
Report").

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

6.9.2

  |  

The Purchaser shall provide to the Seller, or cause the Title Company to
provide to the Seller, copies of any update to the Title Commitment (and a
copy of each document referenced in the Title Commitments as an exception to
title), Survey or Zoning Report promptly following completion. The Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser to facilitate the delivery of
the Title Commitment, Zoning Report and the Survey prior to Closing. At any
time prior to Closing, the Purchaser may deliver to the Seller a letter (which
shall be accompanied by any update to the Title Commitment, Zoning Report or
Survey) setting forth any material defects or impairments to the status of
title as set forth in any update to the Title Commitment (how, any material
defects or impairments as to the status of the zoning compliance as set forth
in the Zoning Report or to any material adverse matters set forth in the
Survey ("Title and Survey Objections"); provided, however, the Purchaser shall
not be permitted to object to any Permitted Encumbrance. Promptly following
receipt of the Title and Survey Objections, the Seller may elect or decline,
but shall not be obligated, to use commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost
to the Seller) to cure any Title and Survey Objections; provided, however, the
Seller agrees (a) at or prior to Closing, to remove or have the Title Company
insure over or otherwise satisfy, by payment or other appropriate measure of
satisfaction, any mechanic\'s lien, tax payment lien, judgment lien or deed of
trust or other financing lien appearing on any update to the Title Commitment
and having a lien amount in excess of $[***], and (b) to deliver at Closing
(i) a customary owner\'s affidavit for each parcel of Owned Real Property
substantially in the form of _Exhibit L_ , and (ii) a customary agreement
indemnifying the Title Company against adverse title matters created by the
action or inaction of the Seller during the "gap" between delivery and
recordation of the deed for each parcel of Owned Real Property. In no event
shall the Seller\'s failure or refusal to cure any Title and Survey Objections

Any new encumbrances or defects that are disclosed in any update of the Title
Commitment or Survey after the Execution Date are Permitted Encumbrances,
except that those new encumbrances or defects ("Subsequent Title
Encumbrances") (a) that constitute a Material Adverse Effect and (b) for which
the Purchaser notifies the Seller ("Purchaser\'s Subsequent Title Notice")
within 10 Business Days after receipt of the update of the Title Commitment or
Survey shall not be deemed Permitted Encumbrances. Failure to notify Seller
shall cause Subsequent Title Encumbrances or defect(s) to be deemed Permitted
Encumbrances. The Seller may elect to remove or correct Subsequent Title
Encumbrances by providing written notice thereof to the Purchaser within five
Business Days from the date of the Purchaser\'s Subsequent Title Notice.
Failure to notify the Purchaser shall be deemed an election by Seller not to
remove or correct such Subsequent Title Encumbrances. In the event the Seller
elects (or is deemed to have elected) to remove or correct such Subsequent
Title Encumbrances, the Seller shall use reasonable efforts to remove or
correct such Subsequent Title Encumbrances prior to Closing, provided however,
that in connection with such efforts, Seller shall have the right to extend
the Closing for up to 60 calendar days by providing written notice to the
Purchaser prior to the Closing. In the event, however, that the Seller elects
(or is deemed to have elected) not to pursue the removal or correction of such
Subsequent Title Encumbrance or does not arrange for removal or correction of
the Subsequent Title Encumbrances prior to the Closing, as may be extended,
then, upon receipt of notice from the Seller of its refusal or inability to
remove or correct the Subsequent Title Encumbrances, then the Purchaser shall
either (x) terminate this Agreement by notice given within 10 Business Days
following receipt of notice from the Seller of its refusal or inability to
remove or correct the Subsequent Title Encumbrances in which event the Parties
hereto shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder, except for
rights and obligations which, by their terms, survive the termination hereof,
or (y) accept the condition of the title to the Owned Real Property as it then
is, without diminution of the Purchase Price, whereupon the Subsequent Title
Encumbrances shall be deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances and the Parties
shall proceed to Closing.

Seller shall pay all recording fees in connection with the release of any

and Survey Objections and the release of any Encumbrances set forth on
_Schedule N_. The Seller and the Purchaser shall each pay one-half (or 50%) of
all transfer taxes and documentary stamp charges in respect of the sale and
transfer of the Owned Real Property. Purchaser shall pay the cost of recording
the Deed of Sale, the cost of any survey (including the Survey) or zoning
(including the Zoning Reports), all title insurance premiums, title exam fees
and any endorsements to Purchaser\'s title policy. Any other customary
purchase and sale closing costs shall be paid by Seller or Purchaser in

with the prior consent of the Seller acting reasonably, and at such time and
in such manner as may be mutually agreed by the Seller and Purchaser. Each of
the Seller and the Purchaser agree that such written notifications and
communications are intended to provide sufficient advance notice to the
Transferred Employees and suppliers of the sale of the Transferred Assets and
the plans associated therewith, so as to provide a smooth transition of the
Transferred Assets from the Seller and its Affiliates to the Purchaser.

if it is reasonably practicable for the Relevant Information to be physically

---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

if it is not reasonably practicable for the Relevant Information to be

the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to notify the Seller and

(c)

  |  

to the extent that books, records, documents and any other materials located
at the Facilities relate to both the Product and to products other than the

practicable for information exclusively related to the Product (the "Product
Information") to be physically extracted from the corresponding books,

7.2

  |  

Consents pertaining to Transferred Contracts; Shared Contracts

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.2.1

  |  

Prior to the Closing Date, and thereafter to the extent reasonably necessary,
the Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Material Consents. Prior to and until six months after the Closing Date, if
reasonably required by the Purchaser, the Seller shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any Consents other than a Material Consent. The
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Seller
to obtain the Material Consents and any other Consents. Neither the Seller nor
any of its Affiliates nor the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall be
obligated to pay any consideration to any Third Party from which Consent or
approval is required in order to obtain such Consent or approval.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.2.2

  |  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shared Contracts shall be either partially
assigned on or within 30 days after the Closing to the Purchaser or its
Affiliates solely with respect to the Facilities or the Transferred Assets, or
terminated on the Closing Date with respect to the Transferred Assets,
whichever is permitted according to the terms of such Shared Contracts.
Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates nor the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates shall be obligated to pay any consideration in respect of the
assignment or termination of any Shared Contract. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, Transferred Contracts and Shared Contracts
that are required for Seller to perform services under the Transitional
Services Agreement shall not be assigned, in whole or in part, or terminated
with respect to such services until the end of the provision of such services
under the Transitional Services Agreement.

   
---|--- 
  

  

In each instance in which a Consent cannot be obtained, or if an attempted
transfer or assignment would be ineffective or would adversely affect the
ability of the Seller or (as the case may be) its Affiliate to convey the
interest in question to the Purchaser, the Seller shall use, or shall cause
the corresponding Affiliate to use, all commercially reasonable efforts to
enter into any such alternative arrangement and Contract with the Purchaser as
may be appropriate in order to allow the Purchaser to realize, receive and
enjoy substantially similar rights and benefits at no incremental cost to the
Seller and its Affiliates.

  

    

7.2.3

  |  

For the avoidance of doubt, no provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted or construed:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(a)

  |  

as an attempt to transfer or assign any Transferred Contract that is by its
terms non-transferable or assignable without the required Consent, or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

with respect to any such Consent that pertains to a Transferred Contract and
which is not a Material Consent, as creating a condition precedent to the
Purchaser\'s obligation to close under this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.3

  |  

Wrongfully transferred or retained assets and liabilities

   
---|--- 
  

  

In the event any of the Parties discovers after the Closing that it, or its
Affiliates, is the owner of, receives or otherwise comes to possess any asset
(including the receipt of payments made pursuant to Transferred Contracts and
proceeds from accounts receivable) or is liable for any Liability that is
allocated to any Person other than in accordance with this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement (except as the Parties may otherwise agree), such Party
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, convey such asset or liability, at no
cost, to the Party so entitled thereto in accordance with this Agreement (and
the relevant Party will cause such entitled Party to accept such asset or
assume such liability). For the avoidance of doubt, if one Party notifies the
other Party that such other Party or any of its Affiliates owns or otherwise
possesses any asset that is (a) with respect to the Purchaser as the notifying
Party, necessary for the conduct of the Product Business following the Closing
as it exists as of the Closing Date, or (b) with respect to the Seller as the
notifying Party, consists of the Excluded Assets, then such other Party shall
transfer such asset to the notifying Party without the payment of additional
consideration or enter into any such alternative arrangement and Contract with
the notifying Party as may be appropriate in order to allow the notifying
Party to realize, receive and enjoy substantially similar rights and benefits
at no incremental cost to the other Party and its Affiliates with respect to
such asset.

  

    

7.4

Excluded Accounts Receivable

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.4.1

  |  

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.3, if at any time after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives any Excluded
Accounts Receivable, then the Purchaser shall pay (or shall cause such
Affiliate to pay) to the Seller (or to such Affiliate of the Seller as the
Seller may have designated in writing to the Purchaser), as soon as
practicable the amount recovered.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.4.2

  |  

After the Closing Date, the Seller shall be entitled to collect the Excluded
Accounts Receivable and to initiate any Legal Proceedings or any other action
with a view to collecting the Excluded Accounts Receivable. The Purchaser
shall not waive or release any of the Excluded Accounts Receivable without the
prior written consent of the Seller or otherwise interfere with the collection
of the Excluded Accounts Receivable.

7.5.1

  |  

If and to the extent that the Seller (or any of its Affiliates) has, prior to
the Closing Date, received any deposit or payment in advance in respect of
obligations to be satisfied after the Closing under any Transferred Contracts,
the Seller (or its Affiliate) shall reimburse to the Purchaser, within 20
Business Days from the Closing Date, an amount corresponding to the amount of
such deposit or payment in advance.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.5.2

  |  

If and to the extent that the Seller (or any of its Affiliates) has, prior to
the Closing Date, made any deposit or payment in respect of supplies of goods
or services not received prior to Closing under any Transferred Contracts
(excluding any Prepaid Amounts, which are addressed under Section 3.3) the
Purchaser shall reimburse to the Seller (or its Affiliate), within 20 Business
Days from the Closing Date, the amount thereof.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.5.3

  |  

If and to the extent that the Seller (or any Affiliate thereof) has, prior to
the Closing Date, received any good or service prior to the Closing under any
Transferred Contract, the payment for which becomes due and payable and is
paid by the Purchaser after the Closing Date, upon request and the
presentation of reasonable supporting documentation of such payment by the
Purchaser, the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for the amount of such
payment within 20 Business Days from the date of such request.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.5.4

  |  

In the event of a disagreement between the Parties as to the determination of
amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.5, such disagreement shall be submitted
for final and binding adjudication to the Independent Expert, in each case,
mutually acceptable to the Parties in writing.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.5.5

  |  

The Independent Expert shall act as an arbitrator to determine only the
disputed items specified in the applicable objection notice submitted in
accordance with this Section 7.5, and the determination of each disputed item
shall be within the range established by the payment amount requested or
offered, as applicable, by each Party in accordance with this Section 7.5. The
determination of the Independent Expert shall be made as promptly as possible
and shall be final and binding upon the Parties. Each Party hereto shall be
permitted to submit such data and information to the Independent Expert as the
Parties deem appropriate. All expenses and fees incurred in connection with
the Independent Expert shall be paid equally by the Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Seller, on the other hand.

7.6.1

  |  

Effective as of the Closing, the Purchaser shall employ all of the Transferred
Employees on terms and conditions which are no less favorable in the aggregate
[***], with benefits as set forth on _Schedule_7.6.1, and with duties that are
similar to the duties being performed by such Transferred Employees as of the
Execution Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall accept and

by the Purchaser on the Closing Date.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.6.2

  |

earlier than [***] following the Closing Date, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, the Purchaser shall (and the Purchaser\'s offer of employment
made pursuant to Section 6.6.2 shall) provide each Transferred Employee with:

---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

subject to Sections 2.2.1(f) and 2.2.2(b), arising as a result of or in
respect of the termination of employment of any Transferred Employees by the
Purchaser on or following the Closing Date (including by way of constructive
dismissals, deemed termination or equivalent concepts under applicable Laws).

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.6.4

  |  

From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall recognize the past
service of Transferred Employees with the Seller or its Affiliates for such
purposes and for any required notice of termination, termination or severance
pay (contractual, statutory under the applicable Law).

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

7.6.5

  |  

From and after the Closing Date, Transferred Employees shall be entitled to
use and obtain their unused PTO benefits and PTO pay under the Seller or its
Affiliates\' PTO arrangements which have accrued up to, and including, the
Closing Date, determined as of the Closing Date. Effective on Purchaser\'s
hiring of the Transferred Employees at the Closing, Purchaser shall credit
each Transferred Employee an amount of PTO hours equal to the amount of PTO
hours that such Transferred Employee previously had accrued but not used with
the Seller or its Affiliates as of the Closing and, for the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the calendar year in which

and subject to the terms of the Purchasers\' then-in-effect paid time off
policies, including, that, as permitted under applicable law, any amounts of
accrued but unused PTO hours at the end of the calendar year will be subject
to forfeiture. Effective beginning the following calendar year, Purchaser
shall allow each Transferred Employee to accrue PTO hours at a rate based on
the Purchaser\'s policies and giving credit to such Transferred Employee for
his or her past service with the Seller or its Affiliates. The Seller shall
retain liability to Transferred Employees for any bonus accrued or any
discretionary bonus consistent with past practice with respect to periods
prior to the Closing Date; the amounts and timing of such payments shall be in
accordance with the Seller or its Affiliates\' bonus plans and, in particular,
amounts will be paid as determined by the Seller or its Affiliates.

From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from all Losses arising or relating to
(a) any collective or mass termination of employment of the Transferred
Employees by Purchaser or its Affiliates, or the employment of the Transferred
Employees, in each case, not in accordance with the provisions of applicable
Laws, or (b) the severance plan maintained by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates as of the Execution Date as described in the summary set forth on
_Schedule 7.6.6_ , that results from the failure by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates to offer to employ each of the Eligible Employees as required by
Section 6.6 (Offer of Employment to Eligible Employees) (except to the extent
that it results from a breach by Seller or Affiliates of its obligations under

performance or non-performance of the Pre-Novation Agreement.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.1.2

  |  

From and after the Closing, and subject to this Article 10, the Purchaser
hereby agrees to indemnify the Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") for any and all Losses
incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of, or related to:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(a)

  |  

any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty on the part of the
Purchaser contained in Article 9;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

any failure to perform, breach or violation by the Purchaser of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

any of the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(d)

  |  

the ownership or operation of the Transferred Assets after the Closing;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(e)

  |  

any Liabilities arising out of the Deed of Sale, the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, the Bill of Sale, the Patent Assignment Agreement or the Trademark
and Domain Name Assignment Agreement during the period after Closing; and

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(f)

  |  

without limiting the foregoing, Liabilities arising out of the CDC Agreement
(including any modifications, amendments or extensions thereto) or the
Novation Agreement arising during the period after Closing, or the
Purchaser\'s performance or non-performance of the Pre-Novation Agreement,
other than those in Section 10.1.1(d).

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.1.3

  |  

For purposes of determining the amount of Losses subject to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 10.1, but not for purposes of determining whether the
representations and warranties giving rise to such right to indemnification
have been breached, such Losses shall be determined without regard to any
qualification or exception contained in such representation or warranty
relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect applicable thereto.

Indemnification Process for Direct Claims

   
---|--- 
  

  

In the event of a claim (other than a Third Party Claim, as defined in Section
10.3) made by one Party against another Party under Section 10.1 (a "Direct
Claim"), the Party making the claim (the "Indemnifiable Party") shall promptly
(and in any event within 20 Business Days of becoming aware of it) give
written notice to the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") of such Direct
Claim, reasonably specifying, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
without waiving any rights under the attorney work product doctrine or rights
of attorney-client or other applicable privileges, the nature and grounds of
such Direct Claim and the amount or estimated amount thereof (which estimate
is for informational purposes only and shall not be considered a conclusive
determination of the final amount of such Direct Claim); provided, however,
that the failure to give such notice promptly shall not relieve the applicable
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is directly prejudiced by the
delay in receiving such notice.

  

    

10.3

  |  

Indemnification Process for Third Party Claims

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.3.1

  |  

In the event that any Legal Proceeding is asserted or instituted or threatened
by any Third Party in respect of which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated
to provide indemnification hereunder (such Legal Proceeding being hereinafter
referred to as a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnifiable Party shall promptly
(and in any event within 20 Business Days of an executive or senior officer of
such Indemnifiable Party becoming aware of it) give written notice to the
Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim, specifying, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and without waiving any rights under the attorney
work product doctrine or rights of attorney-client or other applicable
privileges, the nature and grounds of such Third Party Claim and the amount or
estimated amount thereof (which estimate shall not be considered a conclusive
determination of the final amount of such Third Party Claim) (a "Third Party
Claim Notice"); provided, however, that the failure to give such notice
promptly shall not relieve the applicable Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by the delay in receiving such
notice.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.3.2

  |  

In the event of a Third Party Claim:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(a)

  |  

the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, if it so elects by written notice
delivered within five Business Days of receipt of the Third Party Claim
Notice, to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim and take such action to
avoid, defend, dispute, resist, appeal or compromise such Third Party Claim
and for such purpose may retain counsel of its choice to represent the
Indemnifiable Party and any others that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
designate in connection with such Third Party Claim and shall pay the fees and
disbursements of such counsel with regard thereto;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

the Indemnifiable Party shall have the right, if it so notifies the
Indemnifying Party, to be consulted in such defense of the Third Party Claim
and to participate at its own expense and with counsel of its choice. In such
event, the Indemnifying Party shall afford the Indemnifiable Party and its
counsel the opportunity to comment (which comments shall be taken into account
to the extent reasonable) with respect to the conduct of the defense of such
Third Party Claim; and

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifiable Party agrees to
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third
Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party defends, or, if (i) appropriate and
related to the Third Party Claim in question and (ii) reasonable in the
judgment of the Indemnifying Party, in making any counterclaim against the
Person asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross complaint against any
Person. The Indemnifying Party shall consult the Indemnifiable Party with
respect to the prosecution of such counterclaim, demand or cross complaint. In
such case and to the extent the counterclaim or cross complaint is related to
the circumstances or facts giving rise to the Loss, the amount obtained and
actually paid to the Indemnifiable Party as a result thereof shall be deducted
from the amount of the indemnification to be paid by the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnifiable Party.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.3.3

  |  

In the event the Indemnifying Party does not timely assume the defense in
respect of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right,
if it so notifies the Indemnifiable Party, to be consulted in such defense of
the Third Party Claim and to participate at its own expense and with counsel
of its choice. In such event, the Indemnifiable Party shall afford the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel the opportunity to comment (which comments
shall be taken into account to the extent reasonable) with respect to the
conduct of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.3.4

  |  

From and after the delivery of a Third Party Claim Notice hereunder, at the
reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifiable Party shall
promptly provide the Indemnifying Party with copies of any document received
or sent in connection with the Third Party Claim and shall grant the
Indemnifying Party and its representatives all reasonable access to the books,
records and properties of the Indemnifiable Party to the extent reasonably
related to the matters to which the Third Party Claim Notice relates and which
does not waive any rights of the Indemnifiable Party to the work product
doctrine or attorney-client or similar privileges. The Indemnifying Party
shall not, and shall require that its representatives shall not, use (except
in connection with such Third Party Claim) or disclose to any Third Party
other than the Indemnifying Party\'s representatives (except as may be
required by applicable Law) any information obtained pursuant to this Section
10.3.4 which is designated confidential by the Indemnifiable Party. All such
access shall be granted during normal business hours on a Business Day and
shall be granted under conditions which will not unreasonably interfere with
the business and operations of the Indemnifiable Party.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.3.5

  |  

Any compromise or settlement made or caused to be made by the Indemnifying
Party or the Indemnifiable Party, as the case may be, in connection with any
Third Party Claim shall be binding upon, and be for the benefit of, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifiable Party, as the case may be, in the
same manner as if a final Order had been entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise; provided,
however, that no settlement or compromise shall be entered into by either the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnifiable Party without the express written
consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). In the event the Indemnifiable Party refuses to consent to a
settlement providing for a monetary payment that provides for a full release
of the Indemnifiable Party and its Affiliates without any admission of fault
or liability on the part of the Indemnifiable Party and its Affiliates or
impose any restrictions on the Indemnifiable Party or its Affiliates, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnifiable Party
for any amount in excess of the amount of such settlement proposal.

General Limitations on Indemnity Payments

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.4.1

  |  

From and after the Closing, indemnification under this Article 10 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any Party with respect to any and
all claims relating to this Agreement, except for claims of actual fraud,
gross negligence, actions taken in bad faith or intentional misrepresentation,
any claims resolved by an Independent Expert under the terms of this
Agreement, and except for the specific performance of covenants or agreements
or claims in respect of the provisions of Sections 7.7, 7.9 or 12.1. Each
Party waives, and shall cause its Affiliates to waive, any other right against
the other Party and its Affiliates for indemnification pursuant to any breach
of representations or warranties, other than as provided in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.4.2

  |  

No claim for indemnification made by a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 10.1.1(a) will be indemnifiable if and to the extent that the fact,
matter, event or circumstance giving rise to such claim is Disclosed to the
Purchaser by the Seller or its Affiliates as of the Execution Date. No claim
for indemnification made by a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
10.1.2(a) will be indemnifiable if and to the extent that the fact, matter,
event or circumstance giving rise to such claim is Disclosed to the Seller by
the Purchaser as of the Execution Date.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.4.3

  |  

The Indemnifiable Party shall take commercially reasonable steps to avoid or
mitigate any Losses in respect of which it might be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article 10.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.4.4

  |  

No indemnification shall be available to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
hereunder in respect of any Loss resulting directly from:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(a)

  |  

the conduct by the Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing Date
(including any restructuring or Tax election); or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

the conduct by the Seller or its Affiliates before the Closing Date at the
direction or request of the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.4.5

  |  

The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article 10 shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnifiable
Party under insurance policies or from Third Parties (other than amounts
recovered from another Indemnifiable Party) with respect to such Loss. If the
Indemnifiable Party actually receives a full or partial recovery under
insurance policies or from a Third Party (other than from another
Indemnifiable Party) following payment of indemnification by the Indemnifying
Party in respect of such Loss, the Indemnifiable Party shall forward such
insurance or other such amounts recovered to the Indemnifying Party less any
costs, fees and expenses, duly evidenced, incurred by the Indemnifiable Party
in connection with the recovery of such amount (not to exceed the amount of
indemnification paid by the Indemnifying Party). For clarity, the provisions
of this Section 10.4.5 shall not apply in respect of any claims in respect of
breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Section 8.8
(Environmental Matters) for which the Purchaser\'s remedy is addressed in
Section 10.6.5.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.4.6

  |  

The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article 10 shall be reduced to take account of the actual amount by which the
Taxes of the Indemnifiable Party or its Affiliates shall be reduced by such
Loss, and increased by any Tax detriment actually realized by the
Indemnifiable Party that is attributable to the receipt of indemnification
payments under this Agreement in respect of such Losses.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.4.7

  |  

In no event shall any Loss relating to a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Article 8 or Article 9 for which indemnification is
provided under this Article 10 include amounts arising out of or in connection
with a change or development in Law after the Execution Date, including any
change or development in the enforcement thereof or any change in the rates of
taxation in force at the Execution Date.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.4.8

  |  

In no event shall any Indemnifiable Party be entitled to double recovery under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. In particular, in the event any
circumstances giving rise to a Loss constitute a breach of more than one
representation and warranty, obligation or covenant on the part of the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifiable Party shall only be entitled to be
indemnified once in respect of such Loss.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.4.9

  |  

If any claim for indemnification is based upon a liability which is
contingent, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to make any
indemnification payment to the Indemnifiable Party unless and until such
contingent liability becomes due and payable, other than payments made to the
Indemnifiable Party to cover the costs and expenses of investigating or
defending such contingent liability, including reasonable attorneys\' fees
incurred by the Indemnifiable Party; provided, however, that any claim for
indemnification that is made with respect to a contingent liability prior to
the termination of the survival period defined in Section 10.5 shall not be
denied, and no Indemnifying Party\'s liability hereunder shall be extinguished
solely because such liability remains contingent at the end of such survival
period.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.4.10

  |  

For the purposes of this Article 10, all amounts which are denominated in a
currency other than the dollar shall be converted into dollars at the rate
published in the Wall Street Journal on the date of the notice of claim by the
Indemnifiable Party.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.5

  |  

Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants

   
---|--- 
  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
notwithstanding any statute of limitations that might otherwise apply, the
obligation of any Indemnifying Party to indemnify any Indemnifiable Party from
and against any Loss arising from the breach of a representation or warranty
set forth in this Agreement or the breach of a covenant in Article 6 will
terminate [***] months after the Closing Date (the "Termination Date"), except
that (a) claims in respect of breaches thereof pending on, or asserted prior
to, the Termination Date will continue to survive until such claims have been
resolved, (b) claims of any Indemnifiable Party for any breach of a
Fundamental Warranty, and any claims of the applicable Indemnifiable Parties
under Sections 10.1.1(c), 10.1.1(d), 10.1.2(c), 10.1.2(d), or 10.1.2(f) shall
each survive the Closing Date and shall expire upon the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, including extensions thereof, (c) the
covenants, agreements and obligations of the Seller or the Purchaser which by
their terms are to be performed after the execution of this Agreement, shall
survive the Closing Date and shall not expire until the expiration date
specified in this Agreement or, if no term is specified, the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations in respect thereof.

  

    

10.6

  |  

Other Limitations

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.6.1

  |  

To the extent that any Losses incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified Party arise
out of (a) a breach of the Seller\'s representations in any of Section 8.3 (No
Violations; Consents and Approvals), Section 8.4 (Title to Transferred Assets)
or Section 8.6 (Transferred Tangible Personal Property and Inventory), or (b)
a breach of the Seller\'s covenants to convey a Transferred Asset, and is
capable of mitigation through the conveyance to the Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party of any non-conveyed asset giving rise
to such Loss (or another non-conveyed asset that would cure such Loss), the
Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate (at the Seller\'s expense) to effect
any arrangement reasonably proposed by the Purchaser for the conveyance to the
Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party of such asset. To the
extent that any Losses incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified Party arise out of
a breach of the Seller\'s covenants in Section 7.2 (Consents pertaining to
Transferred Contracts; Shared Contracts) which is capable of mitigation
through making available to the Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
Indemnified Party any Shared Contract giving rise to such Loss (or another
asset that would cure such Loss), the Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate
(at the Seller\'s expense) to effect any arrangement reasonably proposed by
the Purchaser to mitigate such Loss. In such event, if the Seller is unable to
effect such arrangement, the Purchaser shall be entitled to obtain a
reasonably equivalent replacement or substitute for such asset on a
commercially reasonable basis, and the reasonable cost of such reasonably
equivalent replacement or substitute will be an indemnifiable Loss hereunder.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.6.2

  |  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Section 10.6.3 below, no claim
for indemnification made pursuant to Section 10.1.1(a) will be indemnifiable:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(a)

  |  

unless the Losses with respect to each individual item or group of related
items underlying such claim exceed $[***] (the "Minimum Claim Threshold"),
provided that if the Losses with respect to such item or group of related
items exceed the Minimum Claim Threshold, the full amount of the claim (and
not just the excess above the Minimum Claim Threshold) will be indemnifiable,
subject to the other limitations herein; and

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

until the indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section 10.1.1(a) exceed $[***] in
the aggregate (the "Deductible"), in which event the Indemnifying Party will
reimburse the Indemnifiable Party only for the amount of the indemnifiable
Losses in excess of the Deductible, except as otherwise set forth in Section
10.6.5,

   
---|--- 
  

  

provided that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
maximum aggregate amount for which an Indemnifying Party may be liable with
respect to claims made pursuant to Section 10.1.1(a), will not exceed $[***]
(the "Cap"), except that claims in respect of breaches of the representations
and warranties contained in Section 8.8 (Environmental Matters) will be
recoverable solely and exclusively as set forth in Section 10.6.5.

  

    

10.6.3

  |  

Notwithstanding Section 10.6.2 above, claims made with respect to the
Fundamental Warranties and the representations and warranties contained in
Section 8.8 (Environmental Matters) will not be subject to, and will not be
considered in calculating whether claims have exceeded, the Minimum Claim
Threshold, the Deductible or the Cap, provided, however, that the maximum
amount for which the Seller may be liable with respect to claims made with
respect to the Fundamental Warranties will not exceed the Purchase Price, and
claims in respect of breaches of the representations and warranties contained
in Section 8.8 (Environmental Matters) will be recoverable solely and
exclusively as set forth in Section 10.6.5.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.6.4

  |  

The Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for Losses that are direct damages
incurred by the Indemnifiable Party, except as provided in the next sentence.
The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any consequential, incidental,
indirect, special or punitive damages, including loss of income, revenue,
goodwill or profits or diminution in value, whether actual or prospective, in
each case, except to the extent any such Losses are paid or payable (and
subsequently paid) with respect to a Third Party Claim as to which an
Indemnifiable Party is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.6.5

  |  

From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of any Purchaser
Indemnified Party in respect of Environmental Matters shall be recovery
pursuant to the Environmental Insurance Policy, and the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties hereby waive any and all rights and remedies against the Seller and
its Affiliates under any Environmental Laws or relating to Environmental
Matters, including for any breach of Section 8.8 (Environmental Matters).

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

10.6.6

  |  

Under no circumstances shall the aggregate liability of the Seller and its
Affiliates under this Agreement (excluding the Seller\'s indemnification
obligations under Section 10.1.1(c)) exceed the Purchase Price.

by either Party if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the six-
month anniversary of the Execution Date provided, however, that the right to
terminate pursuant to this Section 11.1(b) is not available to any Party whose
breach of any provision of this Agreement results in or causes the failure of
the Closing to be consummated by such time (it being understood that no Party
shall be deemed in breach pursuant to this Section 11.1(b) as a result of any
breach that was due, in whole or in part, to any breach or other action or
omission of the other Party);

   
---|---

violate any non-appealable final Order of any Governmental Authority; or

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(d)

  |  

by the Purchaser if the condition precedent set forth in Section 5.2(b) is not
fulfilled, or by the Seller if the condition precedent set forth in Section
5.3(a) is not fulfilled, in each case as a result of a breach, failure or
misrepresentation which has not been cured within 20 Business Days of

agrees not to (and to cause its Representatives not to):

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(a)

  |  

disclose any Confidential Information to any Person other than its
Representatives who need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements; and

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with
(i) the performance of their respective obligations hereunder or to exercise
or enforce their respective rights under this Agreement, any Ancillary

Agreement), or any other Contract pursuant to which the Seller or any of its
Affiliates obtains rights to the Licensed Know-How, (ii) operate the business
of the respective Party without violating any of the provisions under this

12.1.4

  |  

If a Party (the "Disclosing Party") (or its Representative) is, as per its
legal counsel\'s written opinion, required by applicable Law, by applicable
stock exchange regulation, by legal process, or for the purposes of
enforcement of its rights under this Agreement, to disclose all or any portion
of the Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party (or its Representative)
may so disclose such Confidential Information, provided that the Disclosing
Party shall, to the extent permitted by Law:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(a)

  |  

provide the other Party with prior written notice of such request or
requirement so that the other Party may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

exercise commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope of any such
request or requirement and consult with the other Party to that effect; and

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

if such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, furnish only that
portion of the Confidential Information which the Disclosing Party (or its
Representative) is compelled to disclose and exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to
such Confidential Information.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

12.1.5

  |  

In the event of termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1,

promptly, upon the Seller\'s written request, and in any event within 10
Business Days of such request return all copies of Confidential Information in
its possession or in the possession of any of its Representatives and destroy
all information or other documents derived from such Confidential Information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser (and its Representatives) shall
be permitted, subject to their continued compliance with the obligations
specified in this Section 12.1, entitled to retain copies of any computer
records and files containing such Confidential Information which have been
created pursuant to its automatic electronic archiving and back up procedures.
If so requested by the Seller, the Purchaser shall confirm in writing that its
undertakings relating to the return or destruction of any such Confidential
Information have been complied with.

12.2.1

  |  

Without limitation to Section 12.1 above (and subject always to Section 12.1.4

issuing (or before any of its Affiliates issues) any press release or
otherwise making (or any of its Affiliates makes) any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the other Party\'s name
or the transactions contemplated hereby and neither the Purchaser nor the
Seller shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without having submitted a draft thereof to the other Party at least 10
Business Days prior to issuance of such press release or public statement. The
issuance thereof shall not be made without the prior written approval of the
other Party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

12.2.2

  |  

Notwithstanding Section 12.2.1, the Parties agree that this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (and the exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto) and
any financial statements relating to the Product, and any descriptions of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Sensitive Information") may contain
competitively sensitive information, the public disclosure of which would be
competitively harmful. The Parties agree that each Party shall notify the
other Party prior to disclosing, filing or furnishing any Sensitive
Information with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or any
counterpart under any foreign jurisdiction (a "Securities Regulator"),
including as an exhibit to any registration statement or periodic report filed
with a Securities Regulator, and shall give the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon (a) any confidential treatment request
to be submitted by the disclosing, filing or furnishing party with a
Securities Regulator related to the Sensitive Information, (b) any redacted
form of the Sensitive Information that the filing party intends to disclose,
file or furnish in accordance with any other applicable Law and (c) any
proposed public disclosure relating to the Sensitive Information. The
disclosing, filing or furnishing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to ensure that all information reasonably requested by the non-disclosing,
non-filing or non-furnishing party to be added to a confidential treatment
request or redacted, as the case may be, is so added or redacted. The
redactions and requests for confidential treatment shall be made in a manner
consistent with applicable Securities Regulator\'s regulations and guidance.
Each request shall seek the longest confidentiality term possible. Any
confidentiality request shall be submitted to and subject to the non-
disclosing, non-filing or non-furnishing party\'s reasonable approval in
advance of filing or furnishing.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

12.2.3

  |  

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 12.2 shall not
apply to the disclosure of the execution of this Agreement by the Parties, the
disclosure of which (including any confidential treatment requests in respect
of this Agreement) shall have been agreed upon by the Parties as of the
Execution Date. In addition, for clarity, nothing set forth in this Section
12.2, shall restrict any Party from making any Required Notifications or
seeking any Antitrust Approvals or Consents in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

other provision of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force
and effect and the invalidity and unenforceability of this Agreement or the

contain all of the material provisions reasonably expected by the Parties to
be contained. The Parties, however, agree to substitute any invalid or
unenforceable provision by a valid and enforceable provision which maintains,
to the fullest extent possible, the respective interests of the Parties as

assigns.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

12.9.2

  |  

Nothing in this Agreement, including Section 6.6 and Section 7.6, shall create
or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person not

Agreement to an Affiliate (provided that such assignee undertakes at the time
of the assignment that if such assignee ceases to be an Affiliate of Seller
such right will, immediately prior to the assignee ceasing to be an Affiliate,
be re-assigned to the Seller or another of its Affiliates) and no such
assignment will relieve the Seller of liability, and (b) the Purchaser may
assign its rights under this Agreement to an Affiliate (provided that such
assignee undertakes at the time of the assignment that if such assignee ceases

  |  

Specific Performance

   
---|--- 
  

  

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, that monetary damages may be
inadequate and that a party may have no adequate remedy at Law. The Parties
accordingly agree that, without the necessity of posting bond or other
undertaking, the Parties hereto will be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement,
this being in addition to any remedy to which such Party is entitled under
this Agreement.

  

    

12.11

  |  

Counterparts
