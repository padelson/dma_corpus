(a) _Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any

in Michael Merger Sub or the Partnership:

(i) Each Partnership Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than any Partnership Common Units to be cancelled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(iv)_) shall be converted into the right to
receive 1.7500 (the "Partnership Common Unit Exchange Ratio") shares of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common stock, par value $0.04 per
share, of Contango ("Contango Common Stock" and such consideration, the
"Merger Consideration"). All such Partnership Common Units that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any Partnership Common Units or book-
entry units which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Partnership Common Units shall thereafter cease to have any rights with

Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_ and as provided by
Law.

(ii) The Partnership GP Interest issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be

by the General Partner immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor or in payment thereof.

 

(b) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the Execution Date and the Effective
Time (and as permitted by  _Article_ __ _ V_), the outstanding Contango
Common Stock or Partnership Common Units shall have been changed into, or
exchanged for, a different number of shares or units or a different class of
shares or units by reason of any stock or unit dividend, subdivision,
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock or unit split,
reverse stock or unit split, combination or exchange of shares or units, or
any similar event shall have occurred, then the Partnership Common Unit
Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ shall be construed to permit any party hereto to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by _Section_
__ _ 5.1_ or the other terms of this Agreement.

terms and conditions under the applicable award agreements evidencing such
Partnership Phantom Units, immediately and fully vest. As of the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each award

 of vested Partnership Phantom Units shall be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive a number of shares of Contango Common Stock equal to the
product of (1) the number of Partnership Common Units subject to such
Partnership Phantom Unit award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_multiplied by_ (2) the Partnership Common Unit Exchange Ratio (with any
resulting fractional shares settled in accordance with Section 2.3(g)),
subject to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.4.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership shall take all action
necessary to provide for the treatment of the Partnership Phantom Units as set
forth in this Section 2.2. The Partnership shall ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, no participant in any employee or director unit option, unit
purchase or equity compensation plan, arrangement or agreement of the
Partnership shall have any rights thereunder to acquire, or other rights in
respect of, the capital stock of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any other equity interest therein (including "phantom" equity or equity
appreciation rights).

Section 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

(a) Immediately after the Effective Time, Contango shall deposit (or cause to
be deposited) with a bank or trust company designated as exchange agent by
Contango and reasonably acceptable to the Partnership (the "Exchange Agent"),
in trust for the benefit of holders of Partnership Common Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of units to the
extent such units are to be cancelled) book-entry shares (or certificates if
requested) representing shares of Contango Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_. In addition, Contango shall make available by
depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the
Effective Time, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section_

Stock payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_, in each case without
interest. All certificates representing shares of Contango Common Stock,

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Contango
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
certificate(s) ("Certificates") that represented outstanding Partnership
Common Units and uncertificated Partnership Common Units represented by book
entry ("Book-Entry Units"), each as of immediately prior to the Effective

payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and any cash in lieu of

that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary
form and contain such other provisions as Contango or the Exchange Agent may

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(k)_), to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents (including with respect of
Book-Entry Units) as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of
Partnership Common Units shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the
Partnership Common Units formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Units (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) (A) that number of
whole shares of Contango Common Stock (after taking into account all
Partnership Common Units then held by such holder under all Certificates and
Book-Entry Units so surrendered) to which such holder of Partnership Common
Units shall have become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i_) (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested),(B) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and (C) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Contango Common Stock payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Units so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any unpaid dividends and distributions
or cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Units. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Unit shall be deemed
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Contango Common Stock payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_.

(d) If delivery of Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Unit shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the delivery of Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Unit or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Contango that such tax is not
applicable.

(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Contango Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Partnership Common Units with respect to the shares of Contango
Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive in accordance
herewith, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Contango Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_, in
each case until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate(s) (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(k)_) or
Book-Entry Units in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_. Following the
surrender of any such Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(k)_) or Book-Entry Units in accordance with
this _Article_ __ _ II_, there shall be paid to the holder of record thereof,
without interest, (A) promptly after such surrender, the amount of any
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Contango Common Stock
and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Contango
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.3(g)_ and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to

(f) The Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Contango Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_
issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Units in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Partnership Common Units formerly represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Units. At the Effective Time, the unit
transfer books of the Partnership shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of the Partnership Common Units that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to Contango or the Exchange Agent for
transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Units, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Units shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article_ __ _ II_.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Contango Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Units, no
dividends or other distributions with respect to the Contango Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Contango. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, Contango shall pay to each former holder of record of
Partnership Common Units who otherwise would be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Contango Common Stock an amount in cash (without interest)
determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share of Contango Common
Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive (taking into
account all Partnership Common Units held by such holder at the Effective Time
and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ by (ii) the volume weighted average
closing price of one share of Contango Common Stock on the NYSE American Stock
Exchange (the "NYSE American") and the other United States exchanges, if any,
on which it trades for the five trading days ending at 4:00 p.m., Eastern
Time, on the last trading day immediately prior to the date on which the
Effective Time shall occur, as such price is reported under the heading "U.S.
Equities" by Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other source as Contango and
the Partnership shall agree in writing.

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Units 12 months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Contango, upon demand, and any remaining holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Units shall thereafter look only to Contango, as
general creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration, any unpaid
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Contango Common Stock payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_ (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws), without interest.

 

(i) None of Contango, Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration, dividends
or other distributions with respect thereto or cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Contango Common Stock properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If
any Certificates or Book-Entry Units shall not have been exchanged prior to
two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which the related Merger Consideration (and all dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Contango Common Stock and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Contango Common Stock pursuant to this _Article_
__ _ II_), would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration (and such dividends,
distributions and cash), in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Surviving Entity, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



7

    

(j) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Contango on a daily basis. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Contango.

(k) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Contango, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Contango or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Contango or the Exchange
Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it or Surviving Entity with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 2.3(e)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Contango Common
Stock payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(g)_.

 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Contango and the Exchange Agent shall each
be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld,
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Partnership Common
Units, Partnership Phantom Units or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Contango or the Exchange Agent determines it is required to deduct
and withhold under the Code (on behalf of itself or its Affiliates), or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, taking into consideration for
such purposes any amounts timely paid to satisfy all or part of the applicable
withholding obligations by the applicable Person to Contango and the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the terms of any applicable award agreement. In order
to implement the foregoing, the Mid-Con Parties shall provide Contango and
the Exchange Agent, no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, with a list of such Persons who have elected to satisfy all or part of
the applicable withholding obligations through an alternative withholding
mechanism. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.
Contango shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the
Mid-Con Parties of any intended withholding and the amount of such withholding
and cooperate with the Mid-Con Parties to reduce or eliminate any such
withholding.

Section 2.5 _No Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

disclosure of such information with respect to any other section or subsection
of this Agreement to which the relevance of such information is readily
apparent on the face of such disclosure that it is applicable to such other
section notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference thereto
and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such Mid-Con Disclosure Letter as

or circumstance or that such has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Mid-Con Material Adverse Effect) or
(b) as disclosed in the Mid-Con SEC Documents (excluding any disclosure set

Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Each of the Mid-Con Group Entities is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership, leasing, holding or operation of its properties
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to

(a) The Partnership has filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") on a timely basis true and complete copies of all
forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed
with or furnished to the SEC by the Partnership since June 30, 2019 (all such

applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, including, in each case, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and none of the Mid-Con SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Mid-Con has made all certifications and statements required by
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the

the accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of its
financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or
applicable Law. The books and records of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries

procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), which are
effective (as such term is used in Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to the Partnership, including its
Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in the Partnerships periodic and
current reports under the Exchange Act, is made known to the principal
executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Partnership by
others within those entities in connection with the reports the Partnership
files under the Exchange Act.

and the preparation of the Partnerships financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Partnership has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of the Partnerships internal control over financial
reporting prior to the Execution Date, to the Partnerships auditors and audit
committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of the Partnerships internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Partnerships
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Partnerships internal control
over financial reporting. A true, correct and complete summary of any such
disclosures made by management to the Partnerships auditors and audit
committee is set forth as _Section_ __ _ 3.6(d)_ of the Mid-Con Disclosure
Letter.

 

(e) As of the Execution Date, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments

Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to

Entities necessary under Law for them to own, lease or operate their

23

    

 knowledge of the Partnership, any other party thereto, and no event or
condition has occurred that constitutes, or, after notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute, a default on the part of such Mid-Con Group Entity
or, to the knowledge of the Partnership, any other party thereto under any
such Mid-Con Material Contract, nor has such Mid-Con Group Entity received any
notice of any such default, event or condition, in case, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Mid-Con
Material Adverse Effect. The Partnership has made available to Contango true
and complete copies of all Mid-Con Material Contracts, including all
amendments thereto.

Section 3.17 _Insurance_. The Mid-Con Group Entities are covered by valid
and currently effective insurance policies issued in favor of the Mid-Con
Group Entities that are customary and adequate for companies of similar size
in the oil and gas exploration, production and development industry in the
locations in which the Mid-Con Group Entities operate. _Section_ __ _ 3.17_
of the Mid-Con Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the Execution Date, a true
and complete list of all material insurance policies issued in favor of any
Mid-Con Group Entity, or pursuant to which any Mid-Con Group Entity is a
named insured or otherwise a beneficiary, as well as any historic incurrence-
based policies still in force. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Mid-Con Material Adverse Effect,
with respect to each such insurance policy, (a) such policy is in full force
and effect and all premiums due thereon have been paid, (b) no Mid-Con Group
Entity is in breach or default, and has not taken any action or failed to
take any action which (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would

no insurer issuing any such policy has been declared insolvent or placed in
receivership, conservatorship or liquidation. No notice of cancellation or
termination has been received with respect to any such policy, nor will any
such cancellation or termination result from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 3.18  _Properties_. Except as does not have and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Mid-Con Material
Adverse Effect, and with respect to _clauses (a)_ and  _(b)_ , except with
respect to any of Mid-Cons Oil and Gas Properties: (a) the Partnership and
its Subsidiaries have good, valid and defensible title to all real property
owned by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Mid-
Con Owned Real Property") and valid leasehold estates in all real property
leased, subleased, licensed or otherwise occupied (whether as tenant,
subtenant or pursuant to other occupancy arrangements) by the Partnership or
any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, including the improvements thereon, the
"Mid-Con Leased Real Property") free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted
Liens, (b) each agreement under which the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries is the landlord, sublandlord, tenant, subtenant, or occupant with

enforceability to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and

Section 3.19  _Rights-of-Way_. Each Mid-Con Group Entity has such consents,
easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses from each Person (collectively
"Rights-of-Way") as are sufficient to conduct its business in the ordinary
course, except for such Rights-of-Way the absence of which is not and would
not reasonably be expected to cause a Mid-Con Material Adverse Effect. Each
Mid-Con Group Entity has fulfilled and performed all its material obligations
with respect to such Rights-of-Way and conducts its business in a manner that
does not violate any of the Rights-of-Way and no event has occurred that
allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation or
termination thereof or would result in any impairment of the rights of the
holder of any such Rights-of-Way, except for such revocations, terminations
and impairments that are not and would not reasonably be expected to cause,
individually or in the aggregate, a Mid-Con Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.20 _Oil and Gas Matters_.

 

(a) The Partnership has made available to Contango true and complete copies of
all written reports prepared since January 1, 2019 and delivered to or
received by any Mid-Con Group Entity in writing on or before the Execution
Date estimating the Mid-Con Group Entities oil and gas reserves by
an unaffiliated person concerning the Oil and Gas Properties of the Mid-Con
Group Entities. Except as is not and would not reasonably be expected to be
material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Mid-Con Group Entities
(taken as a whole), and except for property (i) sold or otherwise disposed of
in the ordinary course of business since the date of the reserve report
prepared by the Partnership and evaluated by Cawley, Gillespie and Associates,
Inc. ("CGandA") relating to the interests referred to therein as of December 31,
2019 (the "Mid-Con Reserve Report") or (ii) reflected in the Mid-Con Reserve
Report or in the Mid-Con SEC Documents as having been sold or otherwise
disposed of (other than sales or dispositions after the Execution Date in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)_), the Mid-Con Group Entities have good
and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis for the
reserves reflected in the Mid-Con Reserve Report and in each case as
attributable to interests owned by the Mid-Con Group Entities, free and clear
of any Liens, except for Permitted Liens. For purposes of the foregoing
sentence, "good and defensible title" means that the applicable entitys title
(as of the Execution Date and as of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas
Properties held or owned by them (or purported to be held or owned by them)
that, as of the Closing Date, and subject to Permitted Liens (1) entitles such
entity to receive (after satisfaction of all Production Burdens applicable
thereto) not less than the net revenue interest share shown in the Mid-Con
Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and Gas Properties
throughout the life of such Oil and Gas Properties except, in each case,
for (i) any decreases in connection with those operations in which any Mid-
Con Group Entity may elect after the Execution Date to be a non-consenting co-
owner, (ii) any decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment, after
the Execution Date, of pools or units, and (iii) decreases required to allow
other working interest owners to make up past underproduction or pipelines to
make up past under deliveries, (2) obligates such entity to bear a percentage
of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and development of, and
operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties, of not greater than the
working interest shown on the Mid-Con Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas
Properties except, in each case, for (i) increases that are accompanied by a
proportionate (or greater) increase in net revenue interest in such Oil and
Gas Properties, and (ii) for increases resulting from contribution
requirements with respect to defaulting or non-consenting co-owners under
applicable operating agreements or Laws that are accompanied by a
proportionate (or greater) increase in net revenue interest in such Oil and
Gas Properties and (3) is free and clear of all Liens, defects and
imperfections of title (other than Permitted Liens).

 



25

    

(b) Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Mid-Con Material
Adverse Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by the Partnership
to CGandA relating to the interests referred to in the Mid-Con Reserve Report,
by or on behalf of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries that were material to
CGandAs evaluation of the Partnerships and its Subsidiaries estimates of
proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries in connection with CGandAs evaluation of the
Mid-Con Reserve Report was, as of the time provided to CGandA, accurate in all
respects. Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Mid-Con Material
Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries set forth in the Mid-Con Reserve Report are derived from reports
that have been prepared internally by the Partnerships management and
evaluated by CGandA, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect the oil and gas
reserves of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries at the dates indicated
therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied
on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except for changes
generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and production
industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion by
production, there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in
the Mid-Con Reserve Report that is or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Mid-Con Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Except as is not and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Mid-Con Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person or individual by
any Mid-Con Group Entity under (or otherwise with respect to) any Oil and Gas
Leases have been properly and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum
royalties, overriding royalties and other Production Burdens owed by the Mid-
Con Group Entities with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by
the Mid-Con Group Entities have been timely and properly paid (except for any
amounts being held in suspense), (iii) none of the Mid-Con Group Entities
(and, to the Partnerships knowledge, no third party operator) has violated
any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act that, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the
provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to
cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas
Properties owned or held by any Mid-Con Group Entity, (iv) each Oil and Gas
Lease to which the Partnership and any of its Subsidiaries is a party is in
full force and effect and (v) none of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice from any other party to any such Oil
and Gas Lease that any of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries is in
breach or default under any Oil and Gas Lease.

(d) Except as would not be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the
Mid-Con Group Entities, taken as a whole, all proceeds from the sale of
Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties of the Mid-Con Group
Entities are being received by them in a timely manner and are not being held
in suspense (by any Mid-Con Group Entity or, to the knowledge of the
Partnership, any third party operator thereof or any other Person) for any
reason other than awaiting preparation and approval of division order title
opinions for recently drilled Wells.

 



26

    

(e) Since June 30, 2019, all of the Wells and all water, CO2, injection or
other wells located on the Oil and Gas Leases of the Mid-Con Group Entities
or otherwise associated with an Oil and Gas Property of the Mid-Con Group
Entities have been drilled, completed and operated within the limits
permitted by the applicable contracts entered into by the Mid-Con Group Entity
related to such wells and applicable Law, and all drilling and completion (and
plugging and abandonment) of such wells and all related development,
production and other operations have been conducted in compliance with all
applicable Law except, in each case, as is not and would not reasonably be
expected to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Mid-Con
Group Entities (taken as a whole).

(f) Except as has not and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Mid-Con Material Adverse Effect, to the
knowledge of the Partnership, there is no well included in the Oil and Gas
Properties for which any Mid-Con Group Entity is currently obligated to plug
and abandon pursuant to the terms of any Oil and Gas Lease, Contract or
applicable Law.

 

(g) As of the Execution Date, and except as would not reasonably be expected
to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Mid-Con Group
Entities (taken as a whole), and except for Production Burdens reflected in
the applicable net revenue interest in the Mid-Con Reserve Report, no Mid-Con
Group Entity is obligated by virtue of a prepayment arrangement, make up right
under a production sales contract containing a "take or pay" or similar
provision, production payment or any other arrangement to deliver
Hydrocarbons or proceeds from the sale thereof, attributable to the Oil and
Gas Properties of such Person at some future time without then or thereafter
receiving the full contract price therefor.

 

(h) Except as is not and would not reasonably be expected to be material,
individually or in the aggregate, to the Mid-Con Group Entities (taken as a
whole), none of the material Oil and Gas Properties of any Mid-Con Group
Entity is subject to any preferential purchase, consent, transfer fee,
termination fee or similar right or obligation that would become operative as
a result of the Merger.

Section 3.21  _Intellectual Property_. Each Mid-Con Group Entity owns, or is
licensed or otherwise possesses adequate rights to use (in the manner and to
the extent it has used the same), all trademarks or servicemarks (whether
registered or unregistered), trade names, domain names, copyrights (whether
registered or unregistered), patents, trade secrets or other intellectual
property of any kind used in their respective businesses as currently
conducted (collectively, the "Mid-Con Intellectual Property") except where
the failure to own or have the right to use such Mid-Con Intellectual Property
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Mid-Con Material Adverse Effect. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of
the Partnership, threatened claims by any Person alleging infringement,
misappropriation or dilution by any Mid-Con Group Entity of the intellectual
property rights of any Person. The conduct of the businesses of the Mid-
Con Group Entities has not infringed, misappropriated or diluted, and does
not infringe, misappropriate or dilute, any intellectual property rights of
any Person, except for such matters that have not and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Mid-Con Material
Adverse Effect. No Mid-Con Group Entity has made any claim of infringement,
misappropriation or other violation by others of its rights to or in
connection with the Mid-Con Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the
Partnership, no Person is infringing, misappropriating or diluting any Mid-
Con Intellectual Property. The Mid-Con Group Entities have taken reasonable
steps to protect the confidentiality of their trade secrets and the security
of their computer systems and networks.

 



27

    

Section 3.22 _State Takeover Statutes_. No "moratorium," "fair price,"
"business combination," "control share acquisition" or similar provision of
any state anti-takeover Law (collectively, "Takeover Laws") or any similar

Entity, nor any of such Persons Affiliates or immediate family members (each
of the foregoing, a "Mid-Con Related Party"), is a party to any Contract with
or binding upon any Mid-Con Group Entity or any of their respective properties
or assets or has any interest in any property owned by any Mid-Con
Group Entity or has engaged in any transaction with any of the foregoing
within the last 12 months, in each case, that is of a type that would be
required to be disclosed in the Mid-Con SEC Documents pursuant to Item 404 of
Regulation S-K that has not been so disclosed. Except as otherwise disclosed
in the Mid-Con SEC Documents, no Mid-Con Related Party owns, directly or
indirectly, on an individual or joint basis, any interest in, or serves as an
officer or director or in another similar capacity of, any supplier or other
independent contractor of any Mid-Con Group Entity, or any organization which
has a Contract with any Mid-Con Group Entity.

 

Section 3.25 _Certain Payments_. No Mid-Con Group Entity (or, to the knowledge

provide post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to any person or ever
represented, promised or contracted to any employee or former employee of any

except to the extent required by COBRA or similar state law;

 

(vii) each Contango Plan is maintained solely in the United States and subject
only to the laws of the United States; and

classification, except where such action would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in any Contango Group Entity incurring a material liability.

 

(e) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
set forth in or contemplated by this Agreement will not result in any breach
or violation of, or cause any payment to be made under, any applicable Laws
respecting labor and employment or any collective bargaining agreement to

received any notice of any such default, event or condition, in case, except
as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Contango Material Adverse Effect. Contango has made available to
the Partnership true and complete copies of all Contango Material Contracts,
including all amendments thereto.

 

Section 4.17 _Insurance_. The Contango Group Entities are covered by valid and
currently effective insurance policies issued in favor of the Contango Group
Entities that are customary and adequate for companies of similar size in the
oil and gas exploration, production and development industry in the locations
in which the Contango Group Entities operate.  _Section_ __ _ 4.17_ of the
Contango Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the Execution Date, a true and
complete list of all material insurance policies issued in favor of any
Contango Group Entity, or pursuant to which 

 



44

    

 any Contango Group Entity is a named insured or otherwise a beneficiary, as
well as any historic incurrence-based policies still in force. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Contango Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each such insurance policy,
(a) such policy is in full force and effect and all premiums due thereon have
been paid, (b) no Contango Group Entity is in breach or default, and has not
taken any action or failed to take any action which (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) would constitute such a breach or default, or would
permit termination or modification of, any such policy and (c) to the
knowledge of Contango, no insurer issuing any such policy has been declared
insolvent or placed in receivership, conservatorship or liquidation. No notice
of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any
such policy, nor will any such cancellation or termination result from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.18 _Properties_. Except as does not have and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Contango Material
Adverse Effect, and with respect to _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ , except with

Subsidiaries have good, valid and defensible title to all real property owned
by Contango or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Contango Owned Real
Property") and valid leasehold estates in all real property leased, subleased,
licensed or otherwise occupied (whether as tenant, subtenant or pursuant to
other occupancy arrangements) by Contango or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, including the improvements thereon, the "Contango Leased Real
Property") free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens, (b) each
agreement under which Contango or any of its Subsidiaries is the landlord,

Way as are sufficient to conduct its business in the ordinary course, except
for such Rights-of-Way the absence of which is not and would not reasonably be
expected to cause a Contango Material Adverse Effect. Each Contango Group
Entity has fulfilled and performed all its material obligations with respect
to such Rights-of-Way and conducts its business in a manner that does not
violate any of the Rights-of-Way and no event has occurred that allows, or
after notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation or termination thereof
or would result in any impairment of the rights of the holder of any such
Rights-of-Way, except for such revocations, terminations and impairments that

45

    

Section 4.20 _Oil and Gas Matters_.

 

(a) Contango has made available to the Partnership true and complete copies of
all written reports prepared since January 1, 2019 and delivered to or
received by any Contango Group Entity in writing on or before the Execution
Date estimating the Contango Group Entities oil and gas reserves by an
unaffiliated person concerning the Oil and Gas Properties of the Contango
Group Entities. Except as is not and would not reasonably be expected to be
material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Contango Group Entities
(taken as a whole), and except for property (i) sold or otherwise disposed of
in the ordinary course of business since the date of the reserve report
prepared by Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. ("NSAI") and William M. Cobb
and Associates ("Cobb") relating to the interests referred to therein as of
January 1, 2020 (the "Contango Reserve Report") or (ii) reflected in the
Contango Reserve Report or in the Contango SEC Documents as having been sold
or otherwise disposed of (other than sales or dispositions after the
Execution Date in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_), the Contango Group
Entities have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming
the basis for the reserves reflected in the Contango Reserve Report and in
each case as attributable to interests owned by the Contango Group Entities,
free and clear of any Liens, except for Permitted Liens. For purposes of the
foregoing sentence, "good and defensible title" means that the applicable
entitys title (as of the Execution Date and as of the Closing) to each of the
Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them (or purported to be held or owned
by them) that, as of the Closing Date, and subject to Permitted Liens (1)
entitles such entity to receive (after satisfaction of all Production Burdens
applicable thereto) not less than the net revenue interest share shown in the
Contango Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and
Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas Properties except, in
each case, for (i) any decreases in connection with those operations in which
any Contango Group Entity may elect after the Execution Date to be a non-
consenting co-owner, (ii) any decreases resulting from the establishment or
amendment, after the Execution Date, of pools or units, and (iii) decreases
required to allow other working interest owners to make up past
underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries, (2) obligates
such entity to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance
and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties,
of not greater than the working interest shown on the Contango Reserve Report
for such Oil and Gas Properties except, in each case, for (i) increases that
are accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) increase in net revenue
interest in such Oil and Gas Properties, and (ii) for increases resulting from
contribution requirements with respect to defaulting or non-consenting co-
owners under applicable operating agreements or Laws that are accompanied by a
proportionate (or greater) increase in net revenue interest in such Oil and
Gas Properties and (3) is free and clear of all Liens, defects and
imperfections of title (other than Permitted Liens).

(b) Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Contango Material
Adverse Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by Contango to
NSAI and Cobb relating to the interests referred to in the Contango Reserve
Report, by or on behalf of Contango and its Subsidiaries that were material to
NSAIs and Cobbs estimates of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the
Oil and Gas Properties of Contango and its Subsidiaries in connection with
the preparation of the Contango Reserve Report was, as of the time provided to
NSAI and Cobb, accurate in all respects. Except for any such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Contango Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve
estimates of Contango and its Subsidiaries set forth in the Contango Reserve
Report are derived from reports that have been prepared by NSAI and Cobb,
and such reserve estimates fairly reflect the oil and gas reserves of
Contango and its Subsidiaries at the dates indicated therein and are in
accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods 

 



46

    

 involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas
exploration, development and production industry (including changes in
commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no
change in respect of the matters addressed in the Contango Reserve Report that
is or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Contango Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Except as is not and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Contango Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person or individual by any
Contango Group Entity under (or otherwise with respect to) any Oil and Gas
Leases have been properly and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum
royalties, overriding royalties and other Production Burdens owed by the
Contango Group Entities with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned or
held by the Contango Group Entities have been timely and properly paid
(except for any amounts being held in suspense), (iii) none of the Contango
Group Entities (and, to Contangos knowledge, no third party operator) has
violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act that, with or
without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the
provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to
cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas
Properties owned or held by any Contango Group Entity, (iv) each Oil and Gas
Lease to which Contango and any of its Subsidiaries is a party is in full
force and effect and (v) none of Contango or any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice from any other party to any such Oil and Gas Lease
that any of Contango or any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default under
any Oil and Gas Lease.

(d) Except as would not be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the
Contango Group Entities, taken as a whole, all proceeds from the sale of
Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties of the Contango Group
Entities are being received by them in a timely manner and are not being held
in suspense (by any Contango Group Entity or, to the knowledge of Contango,
any third party operator thereof or any other Person) for any reason other
than awaiting preparation and approval of division order title opinions for
recently drilled Wells.

(e) Since June 30, 2019, all of the Wells and all water, CO2, injection or
other wells located on the Oil and Gas Leases of the Contango Group Entities
or otherwise associated with an Oil and Gas Property of the Contango Group
Entities have been drilled, completed and operated within the limits permitted
by the applicable contracts entered into by the Contango Group Entity related
to such wells and applicable Law, and all drilling and completion (and
plugging and abandonment) of such wells and all related development,
production and other operations have been conducted in compliance with all
applicable Law except, in each case, as is not and would not reasonably be
expected to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Contango
Group Entities (taken as a whole).

 

(f) Except as has not and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Contango Material Adverse Effect, to the
knowledge of Contango, there is no well included in the Oil and Gas Properties
for which any Contango Group Entity is currently obligated to plug and abandon
pursuant to the terms of any Oil and Gas Lease, Contract or applicable Law.

 



47

    

(g) As of the Execution Date, and except as would not reasonably be expected
to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Contango Group
Entities (taken as a whole), and except for Production Burdens reflected in
the applicable net revenue interest in the Contango Reserve Report, no
Contango Group Entity is obligated by virtue of a prepayment arrangement,
make up right under a production sales contract containing a "take or pay" or
similar provision, production payment or any other arrangement to deliver
Hydrocarbons or proceeds from the sale thereof, attributable to the Oil and
Gas Properties of such Person at some future time without then or thereafter
receiving the full contract price therefor.

 

(h) Except as is not and would not reasonably be expected to be material,
individually or in the aggregate, to the Contango Group Entities (taken as a
whole), none of the material Oil and Gas Properties of any Contango Group
Entity is subject to any preferential purchase, consent, transfer fee,
termination fee or similar right or obligation that would become operative as
a result of the Merger.

Section 4.21 _Intellectual Property_. Each Contango Group Entity owns, or is
licensed or otherwise possesses adequate rights to use (in the manner and to
the extent it has used the same), all trademarks or servicemarks (whether
registered or unregistered), trade names, domain names, copyrights (whether
registered or unregistered), patents, trade secrets or other intellectual
property of any kind used in their respective businesses as currently
conducted (collectively, the "Contango Intellectual Property"), except where
the failure to own or have the right to use such Contango Intellectual
Property would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Contango Material Adverse Effect. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of Contango, threatened claims by any Person alleging
infringement, misappropriation or dilution by any Contango Group Entity of
the intellectual property rights of any Person. The conduct of the businesses
of the Contango Group Entities has not infringed, misappropriated or diluted,
and does not infringe, misappropriate or dilute, any intellectual property
rights of any Person, except for such matters that have not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Contango
Material Adverse Effect. No Contango Group Entity has made any claim of
infringement, misappropriation or other violation by others of its rights to
or in connection with the Contango Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of
Contango, no Person is infringing, misappropriating or diluting any Contango
Intellectual Property. The Contango Group Entities have taken reasonable steps
to protect the confidentiality of their trade secrets and the security of
their computer systems and networks.

 

Section 4.22 _State Takeover Statutes_. No Takeover Laws or any similar anti-
takeover provision in the Governing Documents of any Contango Party is
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 4.23 _No Rights Plan_. There is no shareholder rights plan, "poison
pill" anti-takeover plan or other similar device in effect to which any
Contango Party is a party or is otherwise bound.

 



48

the Contango SEC Documents, no present or former director, executive officer,
shareholder, partner, member, employee or Affiliate of any Contango Group

of the foregoing, a "Contango Related Party"), is a party to any Contract
with or binding upon any Contango Group Entity or any of their respective

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation by the_ _Mid-Con Parties_ _; Recommendation of
the Merger_.

(a) From the Execution Date until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Mid-Con
Parties shall not, shall cause the other Mid-Con Group Entities and the
respective officers, directors, financial advisers, attorneys and accountants
of the Mid-Con Group Entities to not, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the other Representatives of the Mid-Con Group Entities
do not, in each case, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, endorse,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer
with respect to, or the making or completion of, any Mid-Con Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead
to any Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information or data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any
way with, any Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal, (iii) notify any Person or Group
(as defined in the Partnership LPA) under the second proviso in the definition
of "Outstanding" in the Partnership LPA that the limitations in such
definition shall not apply or (iv) resolve, agree or propose to do any of the
foregoing. The Mid-Con Parties shall, shall cause the other Mid-Con Group
Entities and the respective officers, directors, financial advisers,
attorneys and accountants of the Mid-Con Group Entities to, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to ensure that the other Representatives of the
Mid-Con Group Entities, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal or potential Mid-Con
Acquisition Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
data room access previously granted to any such Person, (B) request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished
with respect to any Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal or potential Mid-Con
Acquisition Proposal, and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify
any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any Mid-
Con Acquisition Proposal or potential Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal, and shall
enforce the provisions of any such agreement, which shall include seeking any
injunctive relief available to enforce such agreement ( _provided_ , 

 



55

    

  _however_ , that the Partnership shall be permitted to grant waivers of,
and not enforce, any standstill agreement, but solely to the extent that the
GP Conflicts Committee has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside counsel, that failure to take such action (I) would prohibit the
counterparty from making an unsolicited Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal to the GP
Conflicts Committee in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ and (II)
would constitute a breach of its duties to the Unaffiliated Public Unitholders
under applicable Law and the Partnership LPA, including any duty to act in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership or the Unaffiliated
Public Unitholders). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time following
the Execution Date and prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval,
(1) the Partnership receives a written Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal that the
GP Conflicts Committee believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such Mid-
Con Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, (3) the GP Conflicts Committee determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisor) that such Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Mid-Con Designated Proposal, and (4) the GP Conflicts
Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that the failure to take the actions referred to in _clause_ __ _ (x)_ or
_(y)_ below would constitute a breach of its duties to the Unaffiliated
Public Unitholders under applicable Law and the Partnership LPA, including
any duty to act in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership
or the Unaffiliated Public Unitholders, then the Partnership may (x) furnish
information with respect to the Mid-Con Group Entities to the Person making
such Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to
the Mid-Con Parties than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement
(excluding any standstill agreement contained therein) (an "Acceptable Mid-
Con Confidentiality Agreement"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (I) the
Partnership shall provide Contango with a non-redacted copy of
each confidentiality agreement any Mid-Con Group Entity has executed in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ and (II) any non-public
information provided to any such Person shall have been previously provided
to Contango or shall be provided to Contango prior to or concurrently with the
time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal
regarding such Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Neither the General Partner Board nor any committee thereof (including the
GP Conflicts Committee) shall:

 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the Contango
Parties) the recommendation by the General Partner Board or any such
committee of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (B) recommend the approval by the unitholders of the
Partnership of any Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions (each such action set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 5.2(b)(i)_ being referred to herein as a "Mid-Con Adverse
Recommendation Change"); or

(ii) cause or permit the Mid-Con Parties or any Mid-Con Subsidiary to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract, except for an
Acceptable Mid-Con Confidentiality Agreement (each, a "Mid-Con Alternative
Acquisition Agreement"), in each case constituting or related to, or which is
intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Mid-Con Acquisition
Proposal, or resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.

 



56

    

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, the GP Conflicts Committee may, if it determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so
would result in a breach of its duties to the Unaffiliated Public Unitholders
under applicable Law and the Partnership LPA, including any duty to act in,
or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership or the Unaffiliated
Public Unitholders, taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that may be offered by the Contango Parties pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2_, make a Mid-Con Adverse Recommendation Change in response
to either (x) a Mid-Con Designated Proposal or (y) a Mid-Con Intervening
Event; _provided_ , _however_ , that the GP Conflicts Committee may not make a
Mid-Con Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Mid-Con Designated
Proposal unless:

(A) the Partnership notifies Contango in writing at least four Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so (the four Business Day
period commencing on the date of such notice, the "Mid-Con Designated
Proposal Negotiation Period"), and specifies the reasons therefor, including
the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, such Mid-
Con Designated Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy (if any) of
the proposed Mid-Con Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant
transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Mid-Con Designated
Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Partnership and the Mid-Con
Designated Proposal Negotiation Period shall be extended for an additional
three Business Days from the date of Contangos receipt of notice of such
amendment); and

 

(B) if Contango makes a proposal during the Mid-Con Designated Proposal
Negotiation Period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
GP Conflicts Committee, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and
conditions of this Agreement as proposed by Contango, continues to determine
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisor) that such Mid-Con Designated Proposal continues to be a Mid-Con
Designated Proposal and that the failure to make a Mid-Con Adverse
Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its duties to the
Unaffiliated Public Unitholders under applicable Law and the Partnership LPA,
including any duty to act in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Partnership or the Unaffiliated Public Unitholders;

_provided_ _further_ that the GP Conflicts Committee may not make a Mid-Con
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Mid-Con Intervening Event
unless:

 

(1) the Partnership provides Contango with written information describing such
Mid-Con Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably
practicable after becoming aware of it;

 



57

    

(2) the Partnership keeps Contango reasonably informed of developments
with respect to such Mid-Con Intervening Event;

(3) the Partnership notifies Contango in writing at least four Business Days
before making a Mid-Con Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Mid-Con Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons
therefor (the four Business Day period commencing on the date of such notice,
the "Mid-Con Intervening Event Negotiation Period"); and

 

(4) if Contango makes a proposal during such the Mid-Con Intervening Event
Negotiation Period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
GP Conflicts Committee, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and
conditions of this Agreement as proposed by Contango, continues to determine
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to
make such Mid-Con Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of
its duties to the Unaffiliated Public Unitholders under applicable Law and
the Partnership LPA, including any duty to act in, or not opposed to, the
best interests of the Partnership or the Unaffiliated Public Unitholders.

During the Mid-Con Designated Proposal Negotiation Period or Mid-Con
Intervening Event Negotiation Period, as applicable, the Mid-Con Parties
shall, and shall cause their financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with
Contango in good faith (to the extent Contango seeks to negotiate) regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Contango.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Partnership set forth in _Section_
__ _ 5.2(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, the Partnership promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours of receipt) shall advise Contango in writing in the
event any Mid-Con Group Entity or any of their Representatives receives (i)
any inquiry or request for information, discussion or negotiation that is
reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates a Mid-Con Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) any proposal or offer that is or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal, in each case together with a
description of the material terms and conditions of and facts surrounding any
such inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the identity of the Person making
any such inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written
proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such Person. The Partnership
shall keep Contango informed (orally and in writing) in all material respects
on a timely basis of the status and details (including, within 24 hours after
the occurrence of any amendment, modification, development, discussion or
negotiation) of any such Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry,
proposal or offer, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries,
correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material
oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting any of the foregoing, the
Partnership shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Contango
orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Mid-Con Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.2(_ _a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ and
shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in such
discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice. The Partnership
shall provide Contango with at least 24 hours prior notice (or such shorter
notice as may be provided to the GP Conflicts Committee) of a meeting of the
GP Conflicts Committee at which the GP Conflicts Committee is reasonably
expected to consider a Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal.

 



58

    

(d) The Mid-Con Parties shall not, and shall cause the Mid-Con Subsidiaries
not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to
the Execution Date that would restrict any Mid-Con Partys ability to comply
with any of the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, and the Partnership
represents that neither any Mid-Con Party nor any of the Mid-Con Subsidiaries
is a party to any such agreement.

(e) Nothing contained in  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ shall prohibit the
Partnership from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a
"stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be
a Mid-Con Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of  _Section_
__ _ 7.1(c)(ii)_) unless the General Partner Board, after receiving a
recommendation to that effect from the GP Conflicts Committee, expressly
reaffirms its recommendation to the Partnerships unitholders in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger in such disclosure and expressly
rejects any applicable Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal.

 

(f) The parties hereto agree that the provisions of paragraph 2 of the
Confidentiality Agreement relating to prohibiting disclosure to any Person
that discussions with respect to the Proposed Transaction (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) are taking place, or other facts with respect to
such discussions, including the status thereof, shall be suspended,
effective immediately, and will remain suspended unless and until this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, at which time such
provisions will be reinstated with full force and effect in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) "Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer with respect
to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, and whether through any merger, reorganization,

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or otherwise, of (A)
assets or businesses of the Mid-Con Group Entities that generate 20% or more
of the net revenues or net income (for the 12-month period ending on the last
day of the Partnerships most recently completed fiscal quarter) or that
represent 20% or more of the total assets (based on fair market value) of the
Mid-Con Group Entities, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such
transaction, or (B) 20% or more of any class of capital stock, other equity
securities or voting power of any Mid-Con Group Entity or any resulting
parent company of any Mid-Con Group Entity, in each case other than the Merger
and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) "Mid-Con Designated Proposal" means any unsolicited bona fide binding
written Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal that the GP Conflicts Committee
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
its financial advisor), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, is (A)
more favorable to the unitholders of the Partnership from a financial point of
view than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by
Contango in response to such proposal) and (B) reasonably likely of being
completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, for purposes of this definition of "Mid-Con Designated Proposal,"
references in the term "Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal" to "20%" shall be
deemed to be references to "50%"; and

(iii) "Mid-Con Intervening Event" means a material event or circumstance that
was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the GP Conflicts Committee prior to
the execution of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were
not known or reasonably foreseeable), which event or circumstance, or any
material consequence thereof, becomes known to the GP Conflicts Committee
prior to the receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval that does
not relate to (A) a Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal, (B) any Contango Group
Entity (including any Contango Material Adverse Effect), (C) any actions taken
pursuant to this Agreement or (D) any changes in the price of Contango Common
Stock or Partnership Common Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the following events or circumstances constitute a Mid-Con Intervening
Event: (i) the receipt, existence or terms of a Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal
or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, (ii) events, facts or
circumstances, developments or occurrences affecting the oil and gas
exploration, development and production industries generally (including any
change in the price of Hydrocarbons or industry margins), (iii) events, facts
or circumstances, developments or occurrences affecting the United States or
global economic conditions or financial, credit, debt, securities or other
capital markets in general, or (iv) any outbreak of, acts of or escalation of

that, in the case of _clauses_ __ _ (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , the impact on the
Mid-Con Group Entities, taken as a whole, is not materially disproportionate
to the impact on similarly situated parties.

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation by the_ _Contango_ _Parties_ _; Recommendation of
the Merger_.

 

(a) From the Execution Date until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Contango
Parties shall not, shall cause the other Contango Group Entities and the
respective officers, directors, financial advisers, attorneys and accountants
of the Contango Group Entities to not, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the other Representatives of the Contango Group
Entities do not, in each case, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
endorse, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or
offer with respect to, or the making or completion of, any Contango
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably
likely to lead to any Contango Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information or data with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, any Contango Acquisition Proposal or (iii) resolve,
agree or propose to do any of the foregoing. The Contango Parties shall,
shall cause the other Contango Group Entities and the respective officers,
directors, financial advisers, attorneys and accountants of the Contango Group
Entities to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure 

 



60

    

 that the other Representatives of the Contango Group Entities, (A)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Contango Acquisition Proposal or potential Contango Acquisition Proposal and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously
granted to any such Person, (B) request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information previously furnished with respect to any Contango
Acquisition Proposal or potential Contango Acquisition Proposal, and (C) not
terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any Contango
Acquisition Proposal or potential Contango Acquisition Proposal, and shall
enforce the provisions of any such agreement, which shall include seeking any
injunctive relief available to enforce such agreement ( _provided_ , _however_
, that Contango shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce, any
standstill agreement, but solely to the extent that the Contango Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that
failure to take such action (I) would prohibit the counterparty from making an
unsolicited Contango Acquisition Proposal to the Contango Board in compliance
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and (II) would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Contango under applicable Law).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time following the Execution Date
and prior to obtaining the Contango Shareholder Approval, (1) Contango
receives a written Contango Acquisition Proposal that the Contango Board
believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such Contango Acquisition
Proposal was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, (3) the Contango Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such
Contango Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Contango Designated Proposal, and (4) the Contango Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take
the actions referred to in _clause_ __ _ (x)_ or _(y)_ below would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Contango
under applicable Law, then Contango may (x) furnish information with
respect to the Contango Group Entities to the Person making such Contango
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the
Contango Parties than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement
(excluding any standstill agreement contained therein) (an "Acceptable
Contango Confidentiality Agreement"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (I)
Contango shall provide the Partnership with a non-redacted copy of each
confidentiality agreement any Contango Group Entity has executed in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and (II) any non-public information provided to
any such Person shall have been previously provided to the Partnership or
shall be provided to the Partnership prior to or concurrently with the time it
is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Contango Acquisition Proposal
regarding such Contango Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Neither the Contango Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the Mid-
Con Parties) the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Contango Board or any such committee of this Agreement or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (B) recommend or otherwise declare advisable
the approval by the shareholders of Contango of any Contango Acquisition
Proposal, or (C) resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions (each such
action set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(i)_ being referred to herein
as a "Contango Adverse Recommendation Change"); or

 



61

    

(ii) cause or permit the Contango Parties or any Contango Subsidiary to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract, except for an
Acceptable Contango Confidentiality Agreement (each, a "Contango Alternative
Acquisition Agreement"), in each case constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Contango Acquisition
Proposal, or resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Contango Shareholder Approval, the Contango Board may, if it determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so
would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of
Contango under applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the
terms of this Agreement that may be offered by the Partnership pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, make a Contango Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to either (x) a Contango Designated Proposal or (y) a Contango
Intervening Event; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Contango Board may not
make a Contango Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Contango
Designated Proposal unless:

 

(A) Contango notifies the Partnership in writing at least four Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so (the four Business Day
period commencing on the date of such notice, the "Contango Designated
Proposal Negotiation Period"), and specifies the reasons therefor, including
the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, such
Contango Designated Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy (if any)
of the proposed Contango Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other
relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such
Contango Designated Proposal shall require a new written notice by Contango
and the Contango Designated Proposal Negotiation Period shall be extended for
an additional three Business Days from the date of the Partnerships receipt
of notice of such amendment); and

(B) if the Partnership makes a proposal during Contango Designated Proposal
Negotiation Period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Contango Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and
conditions of this Agreement as proposed by the Partnership, continues to
determine in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor) that such Contango Designated Proposal continues to be a
Contango Designated Proposal and that the failure to make a Contango Adverse
Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of Contango under applicable Law;

_provided_   _further_ that the Contango Board may not make a Contango
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Contango Intervening Event
unless:

 

(1) Contango provides the Partnership with written information describing such
Contango Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably
practicable after becoming aware of it;

 



62

    

(2) Contango keeps the Partnership reasonably informed of developments
with respect to such Contango Intervening Event;

(3) Contango notifies the Partnership in writing at least four Business
Days before making a Contango Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
such Contango Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the
reasons therefor (the four Business Day period commencing on the date of such
notice, the "Contango Intervening Event Negotiation Period"); and

(4) if the Partnership makes a proposal during the Contango Intervening Event
Negotiation Period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Contango Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and
conditions of this Agreement as proposed by the Partnership, continues to
determine in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to make such Contango Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Contango under
applicable Law.

During the Contango Designated Proposal Negotiation Period or the Contango
Intervening Event Negotiation Period, as applicable, Contango shall,
and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with the
Partnership in good faith (to the extent the Partnership seeks to negotiate)
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by the Partnership.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Contango set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.3(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, Contango promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours of receipt) shall advise the Partnership in writing in the
event any Contango Group Entity or any of their Representatives receives (i)
any inquiry or request for information, discussion or negotiation that is
reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates a Contango Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) any proposal or offer that is or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Contango Acquisition Proposal, in each case together with a description
of the material terms and conditions of and facts surrounding any such
inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the identity of the Person making any
such inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written proposal,
offer or draft agreement provided by such Person. Contango shall keep the
Partnership informed (orally and in writing) in all material respects on a
timely basis of the status and details (including, within 24 hours after the
occurrence of any amendment, modification, development, discussion or
negotiation) of any such Contango Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry,
proposal or offer, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries,
correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material
oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting any of the foregoing, Contango
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify the Partnership
orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Contango Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ and
shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in such
discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice. Contango shall
provide the Partnership with at least 24 hours prior notice (or such shorter
notice as may be provided to the Contango Board) of a meeting of the Contango
Board at which the Contango Board is reasonably expected to consider a
Contango Acquisition Proposal.

 



63

    

(d) The Contango Parties shall not, and shall cause the Contango Subsidiaries
not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent
to the Execution Date that would restrict either Contango Partys ability to
comply with any of the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, and Contango
represents that none of the Contango Parties nor any of the Contango
Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

(e) Nothing contained in  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ shall prohibit Contango
from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look
and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Contango
Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of _Section_ __ _
7.1(d)(ii)_) unless the Contango Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation
to Contangos shareholders in favor of the approval of the Contango Stock
Issuance in such disclosure and expressly rejects any applicable Contango
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) "Contango Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer with respect
to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, and whether through any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, tender offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition,
asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or otherwise, of (A)
assets or businesses of the Contango Group Entities that generate 20% or more
of the net revenues or net income (for the 12-month period ending on the last
day of Contangos most recently completed fiscal quarter) or that represent
20% or more of the total assets (based on fair market value) of the Contango
Group Entities, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or
(B) 20% or more of any class of capital stock, other equity securities or
voting power of any Contango Group Entity or any resulting parent company of
any Contango Group Entity, in each case other than the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) "Contango Designated Proposal" means any unsolicited bona fide binding

favorable to the shareholders of Contango from a financial point of view than
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Contango in
response to such proposal) and (B) reasonably likely of being completed on the
terms proposed on a timely basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes
of this definition of "Contango Designated Proposal," references in the term
"Contango Acquisition Proposal" to "20%" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%"; and

 



64

    

(iii) "Contango Intervening Event" means a material event or circumstance
that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Contango Board prior to
the execution of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were
not known or reasonably foreseeable), which event or circumstance, or
any material consequence thereof, becomes known to the Contango Board prior
to the receipt of the Contango Shareholder Approval that does not relate to
(A) a Contango Acquisition Proposal, (B) any Mid-Con Group Entity (including
any Mid-Con Material Adverse Effect), (C) any actions taken pursuant to this
Agreement or (D) any changes in the price of Contango Common Stock or

Section 5.4 _Preparation of Registration Statement and Consent Statement/Proxy
Statement/Prospectus_ _;_ _Contango_ _ Special Shareholders Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Execution Date, (i) the
Partnership and Contango shall prepare and file with the SEC the Consent
Statement/Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be sent to (A) the unitholders of the
Partnership in connection with the Mid-Con Written Consent and (B)
the shareholders of Contango relating to the special meeting of Contangos
shareholders (the "Contango Special Shareholders Meeting") to be held to
consider the approval of the Contango Stock Issuance or, if elected
by Contango in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4(c)_, in connection with
the Contango Written Consent and (ii) Contango shall prepare (with the
Partnerships reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement, in which the Consent Statement/Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Contango Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger. Each of the Partnership and Contango shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to
keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Contango shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in
any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general
consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance of shares
of Contango Common Stock in the Merger and the Partnership shall furnish all
information concerning the Partnership and the holders of Partnership Common
Units as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. The
Partnership shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Consent
Statement/Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Partnerships
unitholders, and Contango shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Consent Statement/Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Contangos
shareholders, in each case, as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Consent
Statement/Prospectus will be made by Contango or the Partnership, as
applicable, without providing the other a reasonable opportunity to review
and

 



65

    

 comment thereon. Contango or the Partnership, as applicable, will advise the
others promptly after it receives oral or written notice thereof, of the time
when the Registration Statement has become effective or any amendment or
supplement thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Contango Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or any
oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Consent
Statement/Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information, and will promptly provide the others with copies of any written
communication from the SEC or any state securities commission and a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the responses thereto. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to the Mid-Con Parties or the
Contango Parties, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Partnership or Contango that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement
or the Consent Statement/Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such
documents would not contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under applicable
Law, disseminated to the unitholders of the Partnership and the shareholders
of Contango; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of such notice and
the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act, the Partnership shall distribute to the
Partnerships unitholders the Consent Statement/Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
which shall include a form of consent that may be executed by holders of
Partnership Common Units in connection with the Mid-Con Written Consent.
Except in the case of a Mid-Con Adverse Recommendation Change permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, the Partnership, through the General Partner Board
in accordance with the recommendation from the GP Conflicts Committee, shall
(i) recommend to its unitholders that they approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (ii) include such
recommendation in the Consent Statement/Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (iii)
publicly reaffirm such recommendation within 24 hours after a request to do so
by Contango. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Partnership agrees that (x) except in the event of a Mid-Con Adverse
Recommendation Change permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, the Partnership
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Partnership Unitholder
Approval pursuant to the Mid-Con Written Consent and (y) its obligations
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_ shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Partnership or any other Person of any Mid-Con Acquisition Proposal or the
occurrence of any Mid-Con Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



66

    

(c) Contango may, in its sole and absolute discretion, seek to obtain the
Contango Shareholder Approval at the Contango Special Shareholders Meeting or
by the Contango Written Consent in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
5.4(c)_. As promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act, Contango shall:

(i) if the Contango Shareholder Approval is to be sought at the Contango
Special Shareholders Meeting, establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Contango Special Shareholders Meeting solely
for the purpose of obtaining the Contango Shareholder Approval and, if
applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange
Act in connection therewith. Contango may postpone or adjourn such Contango
Special Shareholders Meeting solely (i) with the consent of the
Partnership; (ii) (A) due to the absence of a quorum or (B) if Contango has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Contango
Common Stock for the Contango Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, to solicit additional proxies; or (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Contango Board has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
Contangos shareholders prior to such Contango Special Shareholders Meeting;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Contango may not postpone or adjourn such
Contango Special Shareholders Meeting more than a total of two times pursuant
to _clause_ __ _ (ii)(A)_ and/or _clause_ __ _ (ii)(B)_ of this _Section_ __
_ 5.4(c)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Contango shall, at the request of
the Partnership, to the extent permitted by Law, adjourn such Contango Special
Shareholders Meeting to a date specified by GP Conflicts Committee for the
absence of a quorum or if Contango has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of votes for the Contango Shareholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Contango shall not be required to adjourn such Contango
Special Shareholders Meeting more than one time pursuant to this sentence,
and no such adjournment pursuant to this sentence shall be required to be for
a period exceeding ten Business Days; or

 

(ii) if the Contango Shareholder Approval is to be sought by the Contango
Written Consent, distribute to Contangos stockholders the Consent
Statement/Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which shall include a form of consent
that may be executed by holders of Contango Common Stock in connection with
the Contango Written Consent.

 

Except in the case of a Contango Adverse Recommendation Change permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, Contango, through the Contango Board, shall (i)
recommend to its shareholders that they approve the Contango Stock Issuance,
(ii) include such recommendation in the Consent Statement/Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and (iii) publicly reaffirm such recommendation within
24 hours after a request to do so by the General Partner Board or the GP
Conflicts Committee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Contango agrees that (x) except in the event of a Contango Adverse
Recommendation Change permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, Contango shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Contango Shareholder Approval
and (y) its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(c)_ shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Contango or any other Person of any Contango Acquisition
Proposal or the occurrence of any Contango Adverse Recommendation Change.

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Each of the Mid-Con
Parties and the Contango Parties shall, and shall cause each of their
Subsidiaries to, afford to each other and their respective Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, to all their respective properties, assets, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, each of the Mid-
Con Parties and the Contango Parties shall, and shall cause each of their
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party: (a) a copy of each

by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as may be reasonably requested (including Tax
Returns filed and those in preparation and the work papers of its auditors);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not require either party to
disclose any information to the extent such disclosure would contravene
applicable Law. All such information shall be held confidential in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, between
Contango and the Partnership, dated as of July 30, 2020 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), which shall remain in effect notwithstanding Section 8(iii)
thereof. No investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ or information
provided, made available or delivered to any party pursuant to this Agreement
shall affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or
remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 

Section 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside
Date), the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i)
obtain all required consents, approvals or waivers from, or participation in
other discussions or negotiations with, third parties, including as required

Partnership be required to pay the Mid-Con Termination Amount on more than one
occasion (although the Mid-Con Termination Fee and the Contango Expenses may
be paid at different times in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(ii))_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the payment by the Partnership of the Mid-Con
Termination Amount pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall not relieve the
Mid-Con Parties from any liability or damage resulting from a willful and
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or knowing and intentional fraud.

 

(ii) Payment of the Mid-Con Termination Fee and the Contango Reimbursement
Amount shall be made by wire transfer of same-day funds to the accounts

7.3(b)(i)(B)_. Payment of the Contango Expenses shall be made by wire transfer
of same-day funds to the accounts designated by Contango within

(iii) The Partnership acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Contango Parties
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Partnership fails
promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, and,
in order to obtain such payment, Contango commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Partnership for the amounts set forth in this _Section_

suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this _Section_ __

(i) In the event that:

 

(A) (1) a Contango Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) or

conditional) is publicly made directly to Contangos shareholders or is
otherwise publicly disclosed, (2) this Agreement is terminated by Contango or
the Partnership pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b_ _)(_ _i)_ or _Section_ __
_ 7.1(b)(iii)_ or by the Partnership pursuant to

 



78

    

  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(i)_, and (3) within 12 months after the date of such
termination, Contango enters into a written definitive agreement for a
Contango Acquisition Proposal made by the Person that proposed such pre-
termination Contango Acquisition Proposal (or an Affiliate thereof), or
recommends or submits such Contango Acquisition Proposal to its shareholders
for approval, or a transaction in respect of such Contango Acquisition
Proposal is consummated ( _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
_clause_ __ _ (3)_, each reference to "20%" in the definition of "Contango
Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"); or

(B) this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Partnership pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_ or (y) by Contango pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(iii)_
at a time at which the Partnership would have been permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_;

then, in any such event, Contango shall (I) pay to the Partnership the
Contango Termination Fee, as determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)(ii)_, and (II) reimburse the Partnership and its Affiliates for all of
their reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants
to the Partnership and its Affiliates) incurred by the Partnership or
the General Partner, or on their behalf, in connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation, investigation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Mid-Con Expenses"), up to a maximum amount of the Total Mid-Con Expenses
Pool, less any amounts previously reimbursed by Contango pursuant to the
second sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)(iii_) (collectively with the
Contango Termination Fee, the "Contango Termination Amount"), it being
understood that in no event shall Contango be required to pay the
Contango Termination Amount on more than one occasion (although the Contango
Termination Fee and the Mid-Con Expenses may be paid at different times in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)(iv_) _)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the payment by Contango of the Contango Termination Amount pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall not relieve the Contango Parties from any
liability or damage resulting from a willful and material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or knowing and intentional fraud.

 

(ii) The "Contango Termination Fee" shall be an amount of cash equal to the
lesser of (i) $1,500,000 (the "Contango Base Amount") and (ii) the maximum
amount, if any, that can be paid to the Partnership without causing the
Partnership to fail the gross income requirement in Section 7704(c)(2) of the
Code, treating the Contango Termination fee as non-qualifying income and after
taking into consideration all other sources of non-qualifying income (such
maximum amount, the "Non-Qualifying Income Cushion"), for such year, as
determined by the Partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the
Partnership receives a reasoned opinion from outside counsel or a ruling from
the IRS ("Tax Guidance" ) providing that the Partnerships receipt of the
Contango Base Amount would either constitute qualifying income (as defined in
Section 7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded from gross income for purposes of
Section 7704 of the Code, the Contango Termination Fee shall be an amount
equal to the Contango Base Amount and Contango shall, upon receiving notice
that the Partnership has received the Tax Guidance, pay to the Partnership
any unpaid portion of the Contango Base

 



79

    

 Amount within five Business Days. In the event that the Partnership is not
able to receive the full Contango Base Amount due to the above limitations,
Contango shall place the unpaid portion in escrow by wire transfer and shall
not release any portion thereof to the Partnership unless and until the
Partnership receives either: (x) a letter from the Partnerships independent
accountants indicating the Non-Qualifying Income Cushion for any subsequent
year (in which case Contango shall pay to the Partnership the lesser of the
unpaid portion of the Contango Base Amount or the Non-Qualifying Income
Cushion specified within five Business Days after Contango has been notified
thereof) or (y) Tax Guidance providing that the Partnerships receipt of such
portion would either constitute qualifying income (as defined in Section
7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded from gross income for purposes of Section
7704 of the Code (in which case Contango shall pay to the Partnership any
unpaid portion of the Contango Base Amount within five Business Days after
Contango been notified thereof).

(iii) Contango shall reimburse the Partnership, from time to time, for all of
the Partnerships documented Mid-Con Expenses incurred by the Partnership
prior to the execution of this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $250,000
(the "Negotiation Expenses"). In addition to the foregoing, Contango shall
reimburse the Partnership, from time to time, for all of the Partnerships
documented Mid-Con Expenses incurred by the Partnership prior to the
termination of this Agreement up to a maximum of the Total Mid-Con Expenses
Pool. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Contango be required to
reimburse Mid-Con Expenses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c_ _)(_ _i_ ) or
this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)(iii)_ in an amount exceeding $1,500,000. The
obligations of Contango pursuant to the first paragraph under "Fees and
Expenses" in the Non-Binding Confidential Term Sheet, dated July 30, 2020,
between the Partnership and Contango are hereby terminated and of no further
force and effect.

(iv) Payment of the Contango Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer
of same-day funds to the accounts designated by the Partnership, (i) on the
earliest of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to,
submission to the shareholders of, or consummation of, any transaction
contemplated by a Contango Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, in the case of
a Contango Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)(i)(A)_
or (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any
event, within two Business Days thereof), in the case of a Contango
Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)(i)(B)_. Payment of
the Mid-Con Expenses shall be made by wire transfer of same-day funds to the
accounts designated by the Partnership within three Business Days after
Contangos having been notified of the amounts thereof by the Partnership; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Contango shall not be required to make more than
one payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c_ _)(_ _iii)_ in any calendar
month.

 

(v) Contango acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Mid-Con Parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Contango fails promptly to pay any
amounts due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_, and, in order to obtain
such payment, the Partnership commences a suit that results in a judgment
against Contango for the amounts set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_, Contango shall pay to the Partnership its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 7.3(c)_ from the date such payment was required to be made until the date
of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

Unitholder Approval or the Contango Shareholder Approval has been obtained;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Partnership Unitholder Approval and/or

otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an
amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the
time of the amendment.

 

Section 7.5 _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, Contango and the Partnership may, by action taken or authorized by the
Contango Board and the GP Conflicts Committee, respectively, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other parties set forth in this
Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to
applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other parties contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the
Partnership Unitholder Approval and/or the Contango Shareholder Approval has
been obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires
further approval by the unitholders of the Partnership and/or the
shareholders of Contango, as the case may be, without such further approval.
Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any
course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have hereunder.
