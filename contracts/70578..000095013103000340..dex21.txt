                             CLOSING; PURCHASE PRICE

        3.1     Closing; Transfer of Possession; Certain Deliveries.

                (a)     The consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
(the "Closing") shall take place on the second Business Day after the
satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in Article 8 (or the waiver
thereof by the party entitled to waive that condition) or on such other date as

the Closing Date.

                (b)     At the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer:

                        (i)     duly executed bills of sale, substantially in
the form of Exhibit G attached hereto, transferring the Acquired Assets to
Buyer;

                        (ii)    duly executed real property special warranty (or

agreements and other documents required to be delivered by Sellers at or prior
to the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                (c)     At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver:

                        (i)     to Sellers, the Purchase Price, less the
Indemnity Escrow, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.3;

                        (ii)    to the Escrow Agent, $25 million in cash (the
"Indemnity Escrow"), to be held for a period of 12 months from the Closing Date
and disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement;

                        (iii)   the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, duly

                        (iv)    all other previously undelivered certificates,
agreements and other documents required to be delivered by Buyer at or prior to
the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        3.2     Deposit Escrow. On the Agreement Date, Buyer has executed and
delivered to Sellers the Deposit Escrow Agreement and deposited with the Escrow
Agent $6.5 million (the "Deposit Escrow"). The Deposit Escrow shall be held and
disbursed pursuant to the terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement.

        3.3     Purchase Price. In consideration of the Acquired Assets, and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall assume the
Assumed Liabilities as provided in Section 2.3 and at the Closing shall pay to
Sellers an aggregate purchase price (together with the amount of the Indemnity
Escrow, the "Purchase Price") of $1.125 billion comprised of: (a) the Deposit
Escrow, which shall be transferred directly to Sellers by the Escrow Agent; (b)
subject to Section 3.4(a) and Section 3.4(b), $918.5 million (including the
Indemnity Escrow) in immediately available funds, by wire transfer to an account
or accounts designated by Sellers, other than the Indemnity Escrow which shall
be delivered to the Escrow Agent (collectively, together with the Deposit
Escrow, the "Cash Consideration"); and (c) $200 million by assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities. Each Seller shall receive that portion of the Cash
Consideration set forth opposite such Seller's name on Schedule 3.3 hereof.

        3.4     Purchase Price Adjustment.

                (a)     The Cash Consideration shall be increased for lease
payments made by Sellers pursuant to those Assumed Contracts set forth on
Schedule 3.4(a) in respect of lease payments due and payable on or after January
1, 2003, as follows: (i) the Cash Consideration shall be increased by $1.00 for
each $1.00 of lease payments set forth on Schedule 3.4(a) made by Seller, not to
exceed $2 million in the aggregate; and (ii) with respect to lease payments in
excess of $2 million in the aggregate, the Cash Consideration shall be increased
by $0.75 for each $1.00 of lease payments set forth on Schedule 3.4(a) made by
Seller.

                (b)     The Purchase Price may be reduced at the Closing, at
Buyer's election, on the basis of the Estimated Net Receivables Amount and the
Estimated Inventory Value set forth on the Closing Financial Certificate
delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 7.17. If the Estimated Net
Receivables Amount plus the Estimated Inventory Value (the "Estimated Working
Capital Amount") is less than $450 million, then Buyer may, at Buyer's election,
reduce the Cash Consideration to be paid to Sellers at the Closing by the amount
of such shortfall (the "Estimated Working Capital Adjustment").

                (c)     The Purchase Price shall be adjusted pursuant to
subsection (e) of this Section 3.4 after the Closing. Within sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Company a
Notice (the "Statement") setting forth the Net Receivables Amount and the
Inventory Value (together, the "Closing Date Items"), as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. The Closing Date Items shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP and the same accounting principles, procedures and methods
that were used to prepare the Company Financial Statements. After the Closing
Date, at Buyer's request, the Company and each of the other Sellers shall assist
Buyer and its Representatives in the preparation of the Statement and

                                       19

<PAGE>

shall provide Buyer and its Representatives any information reasonably requested
and shall further provide them with access at all reasonable times during
regular business hours and upon reasonable notice to personnel, books and
records of the Company and each of the other Sellers for such purpose.

                (d)     Unless the Company notifies Buyer in writing within 30
days after Buyer's delivery of the Statement of any objection to any component
of the computation of the Closing Items set forth therein (the "Objection
Notice"), such computation shall be final and binding. The Objection Notice
shall specify the amount of and the basis for the objections set forth therein.
The Objection Notice shall include only objections based on (i) mathematical
errors in computation of the Closing Date Items, or (ii) Closing Date Items not
having been prepared in accordance with GAAP or the same accounting principles,
procedures and methods that were used to prepare the Company Financial
Statements. If Buyer and the Company cannot resolve any such objections, then
such objections shall be resolved by an independent nationally recognized
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Company (the "Independent
Accounting Firm"). The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
made as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than 75 days after
delivery of the Statement, and shall be final and binding on the parties, absent
manifest error, which error may only be corrected by such Independent Accounting
Firm. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid
one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Company.

                (e)     If the aggregate amount of Accounts Receivable included
in the Acquired Assets (excluding the amount of Accounts Receivable of National
Steel Pellet Company included in the Acquired Assets) minus (i) the aggregate
amount of Accounts Payable included in the Assumed Liabilities (excluding the
amount of Accounts Payable of National Steel Pellet Company included in the
Assumed Liabilities) and (ii) the Company Reserves (the "Net Receivables
Amount"), plus the Inventory Value, excluding the Inventory Value of the
Inventory of National Steel Pellet Company included in the Acquired Assets (the
"Working Capital Amount"), is less than $450 million then the Purchase Price
shall be decreased by the amount of the shortfall (the "Working Capital
Adjustment"). Any Working Capital Adjustment resulting from this Section 3.4(e)
shall be offset by any reduction to the Purchase Price made at the Closing based
on the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment.

                (f)     The amount of the Working Capital Adjustment shall be
paid on the Adjustment Payment Date. The "Adjustment Payment Date" shall be the
date that is 35 days after the delivery of the Statement; provided, however, if
Sellers dispute the Statement, the Adjustment Payment Date shall be the date
that is 15 days after the final determination of the Closing Date Items in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.4(d).

        3.5     Allocation of Purchase Price. Buyer and each Seller shall agree
upon an allocation of the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities among the
Acquired Assets (the "Allocation") for all income Tax purposes. The Allocation
shall be consistent with the Code and based on an initial proposal by Buyer.
Sellers will have the right to raise reasonable objections to the Allocation
within 15 days after Buyer's delivery thereof, in which event Buyer and Sellers
will negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Sellers
cannot resolve such dispute within 15 days after Sellers notify Buyer of such
objections, such dispute with respect to the Allocation shall be presented to
the Independent Accounting Firm, which shall, within 30

                                       20

<PAGE>

days thereafter, render a decision, which shall be final and binding upon each
of the parties. The fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith
shall be shared in equal amounts by Buyer and Sellers. Buyer and Sellers each
shall report and file all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns and claims
for refunds) consistent with the Allocation, and shall take no position contrary
thereto or inconsistent therewith (including in any audits or examinations by
any Tax Authority or any other Proceedings). Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate
in the preparation of, and shall timely file, any forms (including Form 8594)
with respect to the Allocation, including any amendments to such forms required
with respect to any adjustment to the Purchase Price, pursuant to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the foregoing
agreement shall survive the Closing Date without limitation.

        3.6     Designation of Affiliates by Buyer. Prior to the Closing, Buyer
may designate one or more of its Subsidiaries to acquire at the Closing all or
part of the Acquired Assets, in which event all references to "Buyer" shall be
deemed to refer to each such Subsidiary with respect to the Acquired Assets to
be acquired by such Subsidiary; provided, however, that no designation otherwise
permitted by this Section 3.6 shall relieve Buyer from any of its liabilities or
obligations hereunder.

        3.7     Section 338(h)(10) Election. Sellers shall cooperate with
Buyer's request to make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code to
treat the purchase and sale of any Seller's equity interest in any of the
Acquired Entities as a purchase and sale of the assets of the entity, to the
extent permitted by the Code.

        3.8     Designation of Exchange Accommodation Titleholder. Prior to
Closing, Buyer may designate one or more Persons as a "qualified intermediary"
within the meaning of Internal Revenue Service Regulation 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4), or
an "exchange accommodation titleholder" within the meaning of Internal Revenue
Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37, 2000-2 CB 308, to acquire at the Closing all
or part of Buyer's rights to this Agreement or the Acquired Assets in order to
effectuate a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code. Buyer's
Liabilities under this Agreement shall be no greater, and no less, than such
Liabilities would have been had the Buyer or its Subsidiaries directly acquired
the Acquired Assets.

                                INDEMNITY ESCROW

        4.1     Creation of Escrow. At the Closing, as collateral security for
the payment of any indemnification obligations of Sellers pursuant to Article 10
hereof, the Indemnity Escrow shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent.

        4.2     Duration and Term. The Indemnity Escrow shall be held, invested
and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Indemnity Escrow pursuant to
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement until the later of: (a) the first Business Day
following the Indemnity Termination Date; or (b) the resolution of any claim for
indemnification or payment that is pending on the Indemnity Termination Date,
but only to the extent of the amount of such pending claim.

                                    ARTICLE 5
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

        In connection with the following representations and warranties,
attached to this Agreement is a disclosure schedule (the "Disclosure Schedule")
arranged in numbered parts corresponding to the Section numbering in this
Agreement of the following representations and warranties. The information
disclosed in any numbered part of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
relate to and to qualify only the particular representation or warranty set
forth in the corresponding numbered Section in this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to relate to or qualify any other representation or warranty unless so
stated otherwise, specifying each other representation and warranty to which it
relates. No reference to or disclosure of any item in the Disclosure Schedule
shall be construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter
is material or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule. Sellers jointly and severally hereby
represent and warrant to Buyer that, as of the Agreement Date and as of the
Closing Date (except with respect to representations and warranties made as of a
particular date, which shall be deemed to be made only as of such date), except
as set forth on the Disclosure Schedule:

        5.1     Due Organization. Each Seller is a corporation, limited
liability company or partnership, duly organized under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, with full power and authority to
conduct its business as presently conducted, to own or use its properties and
assets and to perform all of its obligations under all Assumed Contracts. Each
Seller is duly qualified to do business and in good standing under the Laws of
each jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the properties owned
or used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by it, requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 5.1
of the Disclosure Schedule lists the form of organization, the jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation, and the holders of the outstanding capital stock or
other equity interests of each Seller and the Acquired Entities.

        5.2     Authorization; Validity. Each Seller has the requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other documents and
instruments to be executed and delivered by it pursuant hereto and to perform
its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by each Seller and the other agreements to be executed and delivered
by such Seller pursuant hereto, and the performance by such Seller of its
obligations hereunder, including the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of each Seller, including by any action or required approval of the
equityholder or equityholders of each Seller. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by each Seller and (assuming this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Buyer and each of the other
agreements to be executed and delivered by parties pursuant hereto other than
Sellers constitute a valid and binding obligation of such other parties and
subject to Bankruptcy Court Approval) constitutes, and each of the other
agreements to be executed and delivered by each Seller pursuant hereto upon such
Seller's execution and delivery will constitute, valid and legally binding
obligations of such Seller enforceable against such Seller in accordance with
its respective terms.

                                       22

<PAGE>

        5.3     No Violation. Subject to receipt and maintenance of the Orders,
consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations referred to in Section 5.4 and
the Bankruptcy Court Approval, the execution, delivery and performance by each
Seller of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, do not and
will not: (a) conflict with or result in, with or without the giving of notice
or lapse of time or both, any violation of or constitute a breach or default, or
give rise to any right of acceleration, payment, amendment, cancellation or
termination, under (i) the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
formation documents of such Seller, (ii) any mortgage, indenture, lease,
Contract, or other agreement to which any Seller is a party or by which any of
any Seller's assets or properties are subject, including any Assumed Contract,
or (iii) any Law or Order pertaining to the Business, the Acquired Assets or to
which any Seller is otherwise subject, except in the cases of clauses (ii) and
(iii) where such conflict, violation, breach, default or right would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or (b) result in the
creation of any Lien (other than Liens included in the Assumed Liabilities and
Permitted Liens) upon any of the Acquired Assets.

        5.4     Third Party Approvals. Schedule 5.4 of the Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and complete list of each Order, consent, approval, waiver or
authorization of any Governmental Entity and each material consent, approval,
waiver or authorization of any other Person that is required in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance by Sellers of this Agreement and the
other documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by Sellers pursuant
hereto and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby other than (a)
Orders, consents, approvals, waivers or authorizations of, or declarations or
filings with, the Bankruptcy Court, (b) filings pursuant to the HSR Act, and (c)
approvals required by the Surface Transportation Board in connection with the
sale of the Railroad Assets.

        5.5     Title to Assets; Sufficiency and Condition of Assets. All of
each Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Acquired Assets (or in the
case of any leased or licensed Acquired Assets, each Seller's rights under such
leases or licenses) shall be transferred to Buyer at Closing, free and clear of
all Liens (other than Liens included in the Assumed Liabilities and Permitted
Liens). At Closing, Sellers will have good and marketable title to each of the
Acquired Assets, except for those Acquired Assets leased by Sellers, as to which
Sellers will have valid leasehold interests. The Acquired Assets constitute all
of the properties, assets and rights used by the Sellers or necessary or useful
for Buyer to conduct and operate the Business as conducted and operated by
Sellers. All of the Acquired Assets are in good order and repair for assets of
comparable age and past use and are capable of being used in the ordinary course
of business in the manner necessary to operate the Business, except where the
failure to be in such condition would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect. The condition of each Acquired Asset that is
leased pursuant to an Assumed Contract is in compliance with the provisions of
such Assumed Contract.

                                       23

        5.6     Intellectual Property.

                (a)     Schedule 5.6(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of all material Intellectual Property used or held for
use in the Business and all jurisdictions where such Intellectual Property is
registered or protected or where applications have been filed, together with all
patent, registration and application numbers. Sellers own and have the right to
use, or, in the case of licensed rights, have valid rights to use, such
Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens).

                (b)     Schedule 5.6(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of all material licenses, sublicenses and other
agreements pursuant to which (i) any Seller has authorized any other Person to
use Intellectual Property, or (ii) any Person has authorized any Seller to use
any Intellectual Property.

                (c)     To the Knowledge of Sellers, the Intellectual Property
does not infringe upon, violate or misappropriate the rights of any Person.
Consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the loss
or impairment of any of the material Intellectual Property or any material right
pertaining thereto. Sellers have taken reasonable precautions and security
measures to protect the secrecy, confidentiality and value of the trade secrets
of the Business. As of the Agreement Date, no Seller has Knowledge of any
infringement or unauthorized use by any Person of any material Intellectual
Property.

        5.7     Compliance with Laws. Except with respect to those matters
covered by Section 5.11 and Environmental Laws (which are covered by Section
5.20), (i) each Seller is in compliance with all applicable Laws, except where
the failure to be in compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) as of the
Agreement Date, no Seller has received any notice of any alleged violation of
any Law applicable to it. No Seller is in default in any material respect of any
Order applicable to the Acquired Assets or the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement. No investigations, inquiries or reviews by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Business have been commenced, nor to the Knowledge of
any Seller, are any contemplated that would impose any material Liability on
Buyer or, from and after the Closing Date, the Acquired Assets or the Business.

        5.8     Title to Property.

affecting any of the Acquired Real Property that would be revealed by an
accurate survey or inspection thereof, which encroachments, facts or conditions

Real Property encroaches in any material respect upon real property of another
Person or upon the area of any easement affecting the Acquired Real Property.

        5.9     Brokers and Finders. No broker, investment banker, financial

Seller, threats thereof, by or with respect to any employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

                (b)     The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is and has been

regulations promulgated thereunder, has occurred under any Plan and to the
Knowledge of the Sellers no action is contemplated by any Seller or any other
Person that would constitute a reportable event, in each case which could
reasonably result in the imposition of any Liabilities upon Buyer. No Seller

in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA in respect of any employee of the Business.

        5.13    Litigation. Other than the Chapter 11 Case, there are no
material actions pending, or, to the Sellers' Knowledge, threatened against any
Seller in connection with the Acquired Assets or the Business or which could

Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all Significant Customers

Accounts Receivable in connection with the Working Capital Adjustment in Section
3.4, there is no contest, claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off under
any Contract or otherwise with any obligor of any Account Receivable relating to
the amount or validity of such Account Receivable.

        5.16    Inventory. All Inventory is in good and merchantable quality and
is useable and saleable in the ordinary course of business, except for those
items the value of which (i) has been reduced in accordance with GAAP and the
Company's inventory policies, attached hereto as Schedule 1.1(a), consistently
applied by Sellers or (ii) is or will be reduced in connection with the Working

true, correct and complete copy of the (i) the audited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2001, and audited consolidated

Company as of September 30, 2002 and consolidated statement of operations and
cash flows for the nine months then ended (the financial statements referred to
in clause (i) and (ii) collectively, the "Company Financial Statements"). The
Company Financial Statements are consistent in all material respects with the
books and records of the Business. The Company Financial Statements (including
the related notes) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied and fairly present the results of operations and financial condition of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby, subject to
normal year-end audit adjustments made in accordance with past practice in the
case of the Company Financial Statements for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2002. Other than the Financing, since December 31, 2001, Seller
has not borrowed, incurred, assumed, prepaid, guaranteed, or become subject to
any material liability or modified any existing material liability (absolute,
accrued or contingent) other than (i) in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice in nature and amount, (ii) as shown on the Company
Financial Statements or (iii) which has been discharged, satisfied or paid in
the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2001.

                (b)     Each of the forms, reports and documents filed by the
Company with the SEC since December 31, 2001 (the "Company SEC Documents")
complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act as in effect on the dates so filed. With
respect to the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the Business, none
of the Company SEC Documents (as of the respective filing dates or, if amended,
as of the date of the last such amendment filed prior to the Agreement Date)
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

        5.18    Contracts. All of the Assumed Contracts are in full force and
effect and constitute valid and binding agreements of the Company or the
Subsidiary party thereto, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
and to the knowledge of the Company or any Subsidiary that is a party to any
such Assumed Contract, the other parties thereto, subject, as to enforceability
against each such other party, to bankruptcy, moratorium or other insolvency
laws and to equitable principles of general application (regardless if
enforcement is sought at law or in equity). With respect to the Assumed
Contracts, upon entry of the Bankruptcy Court Approval and payment of the Cure
Amounts, (i) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be in breach or default
of its obligations thereunder, (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company or any of
its

                                       27

<PAGE>

Subsidiaries, no conditions exist that with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a default thereunder, and (iii) to the Knowledge of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, no other party to any of the Assumed Contracts is in
breach or default thereunder, except in each case where such breach or default
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule
5.18 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list, as of
the Agreement Date, of all Material Contracts other than those Contracts that
are "Material Contracts" solely because such Contracts are "Assumed Contracts."

        5.19    Permits. Schedule 5.19 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, complete and correct list of all material Permits held by the Company or
its Subsidiaries as of the Agreement Date in connection with the Business or the
Acquired Assets (including the date of expiration of each Permit). Each Permit
is valid and in full force and effect and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default under or in violation of, and no condition exists
that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default under or a
violation of, any such Permit, except for such defaults or violations which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

        5.20    Environmental Matters. Each Seller and each Acquired Entity is
in compliance with all Environmental Laws. Sellers possess and are in compliance
with all Permits required under Environmental Laws for the conduct of the
Business. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, threatened Proceedings against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries alleging a violation of or Liability under any Environmental Law.
There has been no Release of any Hazardous Substance that will or is reasonably
likely to require abatement or correction under Environmental Laws at (A) any of
the Acquired Real Property or (B) any property to which any Seller sent waste
materials for treatment, storage or disposal since January 1, 2001. Sellers have
provided to Buyer copies of all information necessary for an understanding of
the presence or migration of any Hazardous Substance on, in or under the
Acquired Real Property. Schedule 5.20 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth: (i)
with respect to the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities, all accruals or
reserves of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to matters arising
under any Environmental Law as of November 30, 2002; and (ii) a list, as of the
Agreement Date, of all environmental audits and all Notices of Violation
relating to the Business, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities. As
used herein, "Release" means any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting,
emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping or disposing into
the environment; and "Hazardous Substance" means any "hazardous substance" as
defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 9601 et. seq., and petroleum, including crude oil and
any fraction or any derivative thereof.

        5.21    Capital Expenditures. As of the Agreement Date, the Company has
made available to Buyer the most recent capital spending plans of the Company
and its Subsidiaries relating to the Business or the Acquired Assets, including
any plans relating to any matter arising under any Environmental Law.

to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other documents and instruments to
be executed and delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto and to perform its

on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Buyer and constitutes, and each of the other agreements to be

obligations of Buyer enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms.

of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not
conflict with or result in, with or without the giving of notice or lapse of

indenture, lease, Contract or other agreement to which Buyer is a party or by
which Buyer or any of its properties or assets is bound or subject, or (c) any
Law or Order to which Buyer is bound or subject, except in the cases of clauses
(b), and (c) where such conflict, breach, default or right would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

        6.4     Third Party Approvals. Except for any approvals required in
order to comply with the provisions of the HSR Act and approvals required by the
Surface Transportation Board in connection with the acquisition of the Railroad
Assets, the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and

there are no actions pending against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

                            COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Closing, the Company

commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the Business intact and preserve the
goodwill of and relationships with Governmental Entities, customers, suppliers,
partners, lessors, licensors, licensees, contractors, distributors, agents,
officers and employees and others having business dealings with the Business,

Assets;

                (c)     mortgage, pledge or subject to Liens (other than

<PAGE>

                (e)     fail to replenish the Inventory and Supplies of the
Business in the ordinary course of business;

                (f)     increase the salary of any Identified Employee at or
after the time such person becomes an Identified Employee, other than in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

                (g)     make or rescind any material Tax election or take any
material Tax position (unless required by law) or file any Tax Return or change
its fiscal year or financial or Tax accounting methods, policies or practices,

Acquired Assets, or modify in any manner that is adverse to the Business or the
Acquired Assets, rescind or terminate a material Permit, allowance, or credit

        7.2     Bankruptcy Court Order.

                (a)     To the extent that the Bankruptcy Court has not already
done so, promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later
than the second Business Day following the Agreement Date, Sellers shall file
with the Bankruptcy Court an application or motion seeking approval of the Sale
Procedures Order and a hearing on the Sale Procedures Order. Bankruptcy Court
approval will be sought for the Sale Procedures Order as a preliminary matter to
the subsequent approval by the Bankruptcy Court of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein. The Buyer's obligations to proceed with the
transaction are subject to and conditioned upon the Bankruptcy Court having
entered the Sale Procedures Order not later than February 6, 2003.

                (b)     The Sale Procedures Order shall include provisions
approving the payment of a fee in the amount of $15 million (the "Topping Fee")
by Sellers to Buyer, which fee shall become payable upon the earlier to occur of
(x) the approval by the Bankruptcy Court of a sale or sales of a material
portion of the Acquired Assets to a purchaser other than Buyer, and (y) the
filing of a plan of reorganization that does not contemplate the sale of the
Acquired Assets to Buyer in accordance with the terms hereof (in each case,
provided that such approval or filing has occurred prior to any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 9 hereof, an "Alternative Transaction"). The
Topping Fee shall be paid in cash: (i) in the case of an Alternative Transaction
described in clause (x) above, upon the date of the closing of the Alternative
Transaction, without the requirement of any notice or demand from Buyer,
directly from, and shall be secured by, the cash component of the consideration
paid in such Alternative Transaction; or (ii) in the case of the filing of a
plan of reorganization described in clause (y) above, from the assets of Sellers
upon the approval of such plan by the Bankruptcy Court,

                                       31

<PAGE>

without the requirement of any notice or demand from Buyer. The obligations of
Sellers to pay the Topping Fee shall be entitled to administrative expense claim
status under Sections 503(b)(1)(A) and 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, shall
not be subordinate to any other administrative expense claim, other than any
superpriority claim granted under the DIP Order or any adequate protection order
in existence at the time the Topping Fee is approved, and shall survive the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.2 hereof.

                (c)     Concurrently with the filing of the applications or
motions seeking approval of the Sale Procedures Order, each of the Sellers shall
file with the Bankruptcy Court applications or motions seeking that the
Bankruptcy Court enter the Bankruptcy Court Approval (the "Sale Motion").

                (d)     Buyer agrees that it will promptly take such actions as
are reasonably requested by Sellers, on behalf of Sellers, to assist in
obtaining the Bankruptcy Court Approval, including furnishing affidavits or
other documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court for
purposes, among others, of demonstrating that Buyer is a "good faith" Buyer
under Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code. In the event the Bankruptcy Court
Approval shall be appealed, Sellers shall use all reasonable efforts to defend
such appeal.

        7.3     Notification of Certain Matters. Sellers shall give prompt
Notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt Notice to Sellers, of (i) any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person which is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not likely to be obtained prior to Closing,
and (ii) any written objection or Proceeding that challenges the transactions
contemplated hereby or the entry of the Bankruptcy Court Approval. Sellers shall
give prompt Notice to Buyer of (i) any notice of any alleged violation of Law
applicable to any Seller; (ii) the commencement of any investigation, inquiry or
review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Business or that any such
investigation, inquiry or review, to the Knowledge of any Seller, is
contemplated; (iii) the infringement or unauthorized use by any Person of any
material Intellectual Property (of which any Seller has Knowledge); and (iv) the
execution of any Material Contract (and Sellers shall deliver or make available
a copy thereof to Buyer). Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
give prompt Notice to Buyer of the execution of any Ordinary Course Contract
and, upon the request of Buyer to make available to Buyer copies of any such
Ordinary Course Contracts. In addition, from the date of the entry of the Sale
Procedures Order until the Closing Date, Buyer shall, once per week, update the
Company on the status of its negotiations with the United Steelworkers of
America.

        7.4     Access.

                (a)     Subject to applicable Law, from the date hereof until
the Closing Date, Sellers (i) shall give Buyer and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, properties,
officers, employees, accountants, auditors, counsel and other representatives,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
Buyer's inspection of Sellers' properties shall not, without the consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, include
the environmental sampling of any environmental media, including air, soil,
surface water or groundwater, (ii) shall furnish to Buyer and its
Representatives such financial, operating and property related data and other

                                       32

<PAGE>

information as such persons reasonably request, and (iii) shall instruct the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' employees, counsel and financial advisors to
cooperate reasonably with Buyer in its investigation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. All such information shall be provided subject to
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding
any provision of the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall,
with the prior consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, have the right to contact and negotiate directly with
Seller's joint venturers and other partners, parties to the Assumed Contracts
and lenders with respect to any Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities. The
Company shall have the right to participate in such negotiations and agrees to
cooperate with Buyer, at Buyer's request, in any such negotiations. It is
acknowledged and understood that no investigation by Buyer or other information
received by Buyer shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty or other agreement given or made by Seller hereunder.
Buyer agrees that any on-site inspections of any Acquired Real Property,
including any inspection or study pursuant to Section 7.4(b)(ii) or Section
7.4(b)(iii), shall be conducted in the presence of Sellers or its

otherwise indicated in the Bankruptcy Court Approval or, at Closing, Sellers or

as is required (after reasonable Notice from Buyer) to avoid any discontinuation

the receipt of any bill, statement or other charge with respect thereto. If such
charges or rates are assessed either based upon time or for a specified period,

services, such charges shall be prorated based upon meter readings taken on the

Arrangements after the Closing. Buyer agrees that Sellers shall have no
responsibility to continue any of the Seller Credit Support Arrangements in
order to satisfy obligations with respect to the Business and the Acquired
Assets arising after the Closing Date. Buyer agrees that, to the extent that the

Buyer will enter into replacement credit support arrangements if and as
necessary to secure such post-Closing obligations. Sellers and Buyer agree that:

Buyer shall have no obligation to enter into replacement credit support
arrangements to the extent they relate to such obligations; and (ii) Buyer shall

injuries or other occurrences which occur after the Closing, and Buyer will
enter into credit support arrangements if and as necessary to the extent they

Buyer is not required to enter into replacement credit support arrangements in
accordance with the immediately preceding two sentences. Seller shall reimburse

representations and warranties of Buyer contained herein shall be true and
correct in all material respects on the date hereof in and shall be true and
correct in all respects on and as of the Closing Date, with the same force and
effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of
the Closing Date, except to the extent that any such representations or warranty
is made as of a specified date, in which case such representation or warranty
shall have been true and correct as of such date; provided, however, that the
failure of any such representations or warranties to be true and correct on and
as of the Closing Date shall not constitute a basis for Sellers to refuse to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby unless such failure, either
individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in or would reasonably be
expected to result in, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect; provided, further, that
for the purposes of this Section 8.2(a), all references to materiality in
Article 6 shall be disregarded; and provided, further, that for the purposes of
the indemnification provision in Section 10.2(a), the references to materiality
and Buyer Material Adverse Effect in this Section 8.2(a) shall be disregarded.

                (b)     Performance of Obligations. Buyer shall have performed
in all material respects all obligations and agreements contained in this
Agreement required to be performed by it prior to or on the Closing Date.

                (c)     Officer's Certificate. Sellers shall have received a
certificate, dated the Closing Date, of an officer of Buyer to the effect that
the conditions specified in Sections 8.2(a) and (b) above have been fulfilled.

                (d)     Bankruptcy Court Approval. The Bankruptcy Court Approval
shall be in full force and effect and shall not have been stayed, enjoined or
modified.

                (e)     No Injunction. No preliminary or permanent injunction or
other Order issued by, and no Proceeding or Order by or before any Governmental
Entity nor any Law or Order promulgated or enacted by any Governmental Entity
shall be in effect or pending which declares this Agreement invalid or
unenforceable in any respect or which materially delays, restrains, enjoins or
otherwise prohibits or seeks to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                (f)     HSR Act. Any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
or any other applicable Antitrust Laws, in each case, if required, shall have
expired or shall have been earlier terminated, and all necessary approvals under
all applicable Antitrust Laws shall have been obtained.

                (b)     by either Buyer or the Company:

                        (i)     if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before the date that is the earliest of (x) April 21, 2003; and (y) ten Business
Days following the entry of the Bankruptcy Court Approval; provided, however,
that the terminating party is not in material and willful breach of any of its
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and has not failed in
any material respect to perform any of its obligations hereunder; or

                        (ii)    if there shall be any Law or regulation that
makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise
prohibited, or if any judgment, injunction, order or decree permanently
restraining, prohibiting or enjoining Buyer or the Company from consummating the

or decree shall become final;

                        (iii)   if Buyer and United Steelworkers of America
shall not have successfully completed negotiating and executed the collective
bargaining agreement as contemplated pursuant to Section 7.16 hereof on or prior
to March 17, 2003 or such other date as mutually is agreed to by Buyer and
Sellers, which date shall be no later than that date which is five Business Day
prior to the Auction Date and one Business Day prior to the Bid Deadline;

                (c)     by Buyer:

                        (i)     if there shall have been a breach by any Seller
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or more
of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1, and such breach shall be incapable
of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
15 days after written Notice thereof shall have been received by the Company; or

                                       43

<PAGE>

                        (ii)    if (A) the Bankruptcy Court has not approved the

of Buyer;

                (d)     by the Company, if there shall have been a breach by
Buyer of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy
one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2, and such breach shall be
incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been
cured within 15 days after written Notice thereof shall have been received by
Buyer; or

                (e)     automatically, upon the occurrence of an Alternative
Transaction.

        9.2     Consequences of Termination. In the event of any termination of
this Agreement by either or both of Buyer and the Company pursuant to Section
9.1, written Notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to
the other party hereto, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become
void and of no further force and effect, and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be abandoned without further action of the parties hereto;
provided, however, that such termination shall not relieve any party hereto of
any Liability for willful breach of this Agreement; provided further, that in
connection with any such termination each party shall be and shall remain liable
for any payments owed or that become owed pursuant to, or that arise as a result
of any such termination pursuant to, Section 7.2(b) hereof or the Sale
Procedures Order, including, without limitation, the Topping Fee; provided,
further, however, that the Topping Fee shall not be payable following
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii). The Topping Fee

                                   ARTICLE 10
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

        10.1    Indemnification of Buyer. Subject to the time and other
limitations in Articles 4 and 10, Sellers, jointly and severally, covenant and
agree to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its officers, directors, employees,
agents and Affiliates (the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or
reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, any and all Liabilities, losses, claims,
damages, punitive damages, causes of action, lawsuits, administrative
proceedings (including informal proceedings), investigations, audits, demands,
assessments, adjustments, judgments, settlement payments, deficiencies,
penalties, fines, interest (including interest from the date of such damages)
and costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements of every kind, nature and description) (collectively,
"Losses") resulting from or arising out of:

                (a)     the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
any Seller herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

                (b)     any failure of any Seller to perform any covenant or
agreement hereunder or to fulfill any other obligation in respect hereof; and

                                       44

<PAGE>

                (c)     any Excluded Assets or any Excluded Liabilities,
including fines, penalties and claims by any Person for damages or monetary
relief to the extent such fines, penalties or claims are with respect to
pre-Closing periods and relate to facts, events or circumstances arising or
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date. The foregoing indemnification by
Sellers shall not extend to or include Liabilities for investigation,
remediation, restoration, including restoration of injuries to natural
resources, response or RCRA corrective action with respect to the matters set
forth on Schedule 10.1(c).

        Sellers' obligations under this Article 10 shall not be affected or
reduced by any knowledge of Buyer at or prior to the Closing of any breach by
any Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, regardless of
whether Buyer gave written Notice thereof to Seller, or vice versa, and
regardless of whether Buyer elected to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby despite such knowledge.

        10.2    Indemnification of Sellers. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Seller, its officers, directors, employees, agents and
Affiliates (the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or reimburse the
Seller Indemnitees for, any and all Losses resulting from or arising out of:

                (a)     the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
Buyer herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

                (b)     any failure of Buyer to perform any covenant or
agreement made or contained in this Agreement or to fulfill any other obligation
in respect hereof;

                (c)     the Assumed Liabilities; and

                (d)     Liabilities with respect to, arising out of or relating
to, the ownership, possession or use of the Acquired Assets and the operation of
the Business on or after the Closing Date.

        10.3    Indemnification Procedures.

                (a)     In order for a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee
(an "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or
demand made by any person or entity against the Indemnified Party (a "Third
Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the parties obligated to
provide indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.2 hereof (each, an
"Indemnifying Party") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Party
Claim promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written Notice of the
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give any Notice or make
any deliveries required under this Article 10 shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Such notice
shall state the nature and the basis of such claim and, if estimable, a
reasonable estimate of the amount thereof. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Party's
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

                                       45

<PAGE>

                (b)     The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend
and settle, at its own expense and by its own counsel (provided that such
counsel is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party), any Third Party
Claim; provided that, and for so long as, the Indemnifying Party pursues the
same in good faith and diligently and provided that the Third Party Claim does
not relate to an actual or potential Loss to which Section 10.3(e) applies in
which the Indemnified Party is Buyer. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to
defend or settle, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party of its
intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense thereof and in any settlement
thereof. Such cooperation shall include, but shall not be limited to, furnishing
the Indemnifying Party with any books, records or information reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party that are in the Indemnified Party's
possession or control and making employees of the Indemnified Party available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any materials provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in any matter through counsel of its
own choosing at its own expense (unless there is a conflict of interest that
prevents counsel for the Indemnifying Party from representing the Indemnified
Party, in which case the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party
for the reasonable expenses of its counsel). After the Indemnifying Party has
notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to undertake to defend or settle
any such asserted liability, and for so long as the Indemnifying Party
diligently pursues such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for
any additional legal expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with any defense or settlement of such asserted liability, except to the extent
such participation is requested by the Indemnifying Party, in which event the
Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for reasonable
additional legal expenses and out-of-pocket expenses, and except in the case of
a Third Party Claim relating to an actual or potential Loss to which Section
10.3(e) applies in which Buyer is the Indemnified Party.

                (c)     No Indemnifying Party shall, without the written consent
of the Indemnified Party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to
entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim
in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
(whether or not the Indemnified Party is an actual or potential party to such
action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability arising out of
such action or claim, (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission
of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Party, and (iii) does not include any injunctive or non-monetary relief.

                (d)     If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of
any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party may defend against such Third
Party Claim in such manner as it reasonably deems appropriate at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party.

                (e)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article
10, if at any time, in the reasonable opinion of Buyer as the Indemnified Party
(notice of which opinion shall be given in writing to the Indemnifying Party),
any Third Party Claim seeks material, prospective, non-monetary relief against
Buyer, its operation of the Business or its use or operation of the Acquired
Assets, then such Indemnified Party shall have the right to control or assume
(as the case may be) the defense of any such Third Party Claim and the amount of
any judgment or

                                       46

<PAGE>

settlement and the reasonable costs and expenses of defense (including, but not
limited to, fees and disbursements of counsel and experts) shall be included as
part of the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If
the Indemnified Party elects to exercise such right, then the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense of such
Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.

                (f)     Notice given by Buyer to the Company shall constitute
valid Notice to all Seller Indemnitees, and with respect to any Third Party
Claim with respect to which more than one Seller Indemnitee is an indemnified
party or a potential indemnified party, all such Seller Indemnitees shall select
a single Seller Indemnitee to act as representative for all such Seller
Indemnitees with respect to such Third Party Claim, and (i) such representative
shall be authorized to make authorizations and consents on behalf of each such
Seller Indemnitee, and (ii) Buyer shall, with respect to all matters relating to
such Third Party Claim, be entitled to rely on the statements, authorizations
and consents of such representative as being the statement, authorization or
consent of each such Seller Indemnitee.

                (g)     In the event an Indemnified Party has indemnification
claim against any Indemnifying Party under the Agreement that does not involve a
Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver Notice of such claim with
reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified
Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from any liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party, except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced by such
failure. Such notice shall state the nature and the basis of such claim, and, if
estimable, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim
described in such Notice or does not respond to such claim within 60 days of
receipt thereof, the Loss arising from the claim specified in such Notice will
be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on
demand following the final determination thereof. In the event of any dispute of
a claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good
faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through
negotiations within a period of thirty (30) days, such dispute shall be resolved
by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction.

        10.4    Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive for a period of 12 months
from the Closing Date and shall not be extinguished by the Closing or any
investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto.

        10.5    Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless any party pursuant to Section 10.1 or Section 10.2 shall terminate
on the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date (the "Indemnity Termination
Date"). If, prior to the Indemnity Termination Date, an Indemnified Party shall
have given notice to the Indemnifying Party of a claim for indemnification then
the right to indemnification with respect to such claim shall remain in effect
without regard to when such matter shall have been finally determined.

        10.6    Limitations on Indemnification. The indemnification provided for
in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 shall be subject to the following limitations:

                                       47

<PAGE>

                (a)     Sellers shall not be obligated to pay any amounts for
indemnification under Section 10.1(a) until the aggregate indemnification
payments equal $1.25 million (the "Basket Amount"), whereupon Sellers shall be
obligated to pay all amounts in excess of the Basket Amount up to the Indemnity
Escrow. Sellers shall be obligated to pay any amounts for indemnification under
Sections 10.1(b) and 10.1(c) from the first dollar of Loss in full up to the
Indemnity Escrow. Buyer shall not be obligated to pay any amounts for
indemnification under Section 10.2(a) until the aggregate indemnification
payments equal the Basket Amount, whereupon Buyer shall be obligated to pay all
amounts in excess of the Basket Amount up to $25 million. Buyer shall be
obligated to pay any amounts for indemnification under Sections 10.2(b) and
10.2(c) from the first dollar of Loss in full up to $25 million.

                (b)     The Indemnity Escrow (as such may be reduced from time
to time by disbursements in accordance with Section 4.2 herein) shall be the
Buyer Indemnitees' sole and exclusive recourse for the satisfaction of any
indemnification obligations of Sellers pursuant to Section 10.1 and in no event
shall Sellers' indemnification obligations in the aggregate exceed the amount of
the Indemnity Escrow. In no event shall Buyer's indemnification obligations
under this Agreement exceed $25 million.

                (c)     The indemnification provided for in this Article 10
shall be the exclusive right and remedy with respect to any claim or cause of
action based upon, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or otherwise in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether such claim or cause of
action arises out of any contract, tort or otherwise and no such claim or cause
of action shall be enforceable unless made in accordance with the procedures,
and within the time periods, set forth in this Article 10. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, either party shall be entitled to any additional remedies
that may be available under law or equity for a breach of a representation or
warranty to the extent such party can demonstrate fraud or willful or knowing
misrepresentation by the other party in a non-appealable final action before a
court of competent jurisdiction.

                (d)     (i)     Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Sellers shall be obligated for Losses in respect of Liabilities and
obligations arising under any Environmental Law under this Article 10 only to
the extent that:

                                (x)     investigation and/or remediation of any
                        Hazardous Substance is required under an applicable
                        Environmental Law or by a Governmental Entity or
                        pursuant to a claim brought by any third party;

                                (y)     the remediation standards selected under
                        the applicable Environmental Law are cost-effective and
                        reasonable under the circumstances; and

                                (z)     the methods selected for conducting the
                        investigation and/or remediation are cost-effective and
                        reasonable under the circumstances.

                        (ii)    If any claim arising under this Article 10
involves contamination that occurred both before and after the Closing Date, the
cost of remediation shall be allocated

                                       48

<PAGE>

between Buyer and Sellers in proportion to each party's contribution to the
contamination to the extent such contribution can be determined and otherwise in
proportion to the period of time each party has owned or had an interest in the
property.

                                   ARTICLE 11
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        11.1    Expenses. Except as set forth in this Agreement and whether or
not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each party hereto
shall bear all costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred by such party in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. As between Buyer and Sellers, Sellers shall bear all costs
of any Persons (other than Buyer, its agents or Affiliates), entitled to
reimbursement by the Bankruptcy Court.

        11.2    Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or
obligations hereunder may be assigned by Sellers without the prior written
consent of Buyer, or by Buyer without the prior written consent of Sellers,
provided, that Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to one or more wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of Buyer, which assignment shall not relieve Buyer of its
obligation hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

        11.3    Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of Seller and Buyer, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the foregoing,
no direct or indirect holder of any equity interests or securities of either
Seller or Buyer (whether such holder is a limited or general partner, member,
stockholder or otherwise), nor any Affiliate of either Seller or Buyer, nor any
Representative, or controlling Person of each of the parties hereto and their
respective Affiliates, shall have any liability or obligation arising under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

        11.4    Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals or
other communications (collectively, "Notices") required or permitted to be given
hereunder or that are given with respect to this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be personally served, delivered by a nationally recognized overnight
delivery service with charges prepaid, or transmitted by hand delivery, or

by facsimile with confirmation of receipt; provided, that if delivered or
transmitted on a day other than a Business Day or after normal business hours,
notice shall be deemed given on the next Business Day. Notice otherwise sent as
provided herein shall be deemed given on the next Business Day following timely
deposit of such Notice with an overnight delivery service:

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

                WHEREAS, Buyer and Sellers have entered into that certain Asset
Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 30, 2003 (the "Asset Purchase

                WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement;

                WHEREAS, Buyer has agreed to assume from Sellers the Assumed
Liabilities as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement; and

                WHEREAS, the parties desire to carry out the intent and purpose

of Sellers, subject to the provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

                NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                Section 1. As of the date hereof, Buyer hereby assumes and shall
hereafter pay, perform and discharge when due the Assumed Liabilities, subject

                Section 5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

Assumed Liabilities as set forth above shall not be construed to defeat, impair
or limit in any way (i) any rights or remedies of Buyer against third parties to

(ii) any other rights or remedies of Buyer under the Asset Purchase Agreement.

                Section 6. Nothing contained in this Assumption Agreement shall
in any way supersede, modify, replace, amend, change, rescind, expand, exceed or
enlarge or in any way affect the provisions, including the warranties,

Agreement.

                Section 7. This Assumption Agreement shall be construed and
interpreted, and the rights of the parties shall be determined, in accordance
with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any
provision thereof that would require the application of the substantive laws of
any other jurisdiction, except to the extent that such laws are superseded by
the Bankruptcy Code.

                Section 8. Without limiting any party's right to appeal any
order of the Bankruptcy Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive

default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) any and all
claims, actions, causes of action, suits and proceedings related to the
foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the
parties hereby consent to and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the

                Section 10. This Assumption Agreement may be executed in two or

                            DEPOSIT ESCROW AGREEMENT

        This DEPOSIT ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is dated as of January
30, 2003, by and among (i) National Steel Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), (ii) AK Steel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (together
with any designated subsidiaries, "Buyer"), and (iii) Fifth Third Bank (the
"Escrow Agent"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meaning ascribed to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of the
date hereof, by and among the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company set forth
on the signature pages thereto and Buyer (the "Purchase Agreement").

                                   WITNESSETH:

        WHEREAS, an escrow fund shall be established pursuant to Section 3.2 of
the Purchase Agreement at the time of execution of the Purchase Agreement, which
escrow fund shall be disbursed at the earlier of the Closing or the termination
of the Purchase Agreement; and

        WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution hereof, Buyer shall deliver
$6,500,000 (the "Deposit Fund") to the Escrow Agent.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the covenants
and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

        1.      Appointment of Escrow Agent. Buyer and the Company hereby
appoint and designate the Escrow Agent as escrow agent hereunder, and the Escrow
Agent hereby agrees to act as escrow agent hereunder, to hold and release the
Deposit Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Article 3 of the
Purchase Agreement.

        2.      Escrow Deposit. On the date hereof, there shall be deposited
with the Escrow Agent on behalf of Buyer, and upon such deposit the Escrow Agent
shall acknowledge receipt of, $6,500,000 in cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit Fund and
shall administer the same in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
Article 3 of the Purchase Agreement.

        3.      Release of Deposit Fund.

                (a)     Certain Definitions. Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Purchase
Agreement. In addition, the terms below shall have the following respective
meanings:

                        (i)     "Notice of Disbursement" shall mean a written
notice that sets forth the provision of Section 9.1 of the Purchase Agreement
pursuant to which termination was

<PAGE>

made and the date of termination of the Purchase Agreement. The Notice of
Disbursement shall include a copy of the notice terminating the Purchase
Agreement.

                        (ii)    "Notice of Non-Objection" shall mean a written
notice from the Notified Party that it does not object to a transfer of the
assets comprising the Deposit Fund.

                        (iii)   "Notice of Objection" shall mean a written
notice from the Notified Party that it objects to a transfer of the assets
comprising the Deposit Fund.

                (b)     Disbursement. The Escrow Agent shall disburse the
Deposit Fund as follows:

                        (i)     Closing. If the Closing under the Purchase
Agreement occurs, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit Fund to the Company
at the Closing. Buyer and the Company shall deliver to the Escrow Agent written
instructions (executed by each of Buyer and the Company), setting forth the date
and time of the Closing and authorizing the Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit
Fund to the Company at the Closing.

                        (ii)    Termination of Purchase Agreement. If the
Purchase Agreement is terminated by either Buyer or the Company pursuant to any
provision of Section 9.1 of the Purchase Agreement, other than Section 9.1(d),
the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit Fund to Buyer. If the Purchase
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(d), the Escrow
Agent shall deliver the Deposit Fund to the Company. Buyer and the Company shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions (executed by each of Buyer and
the Company) setting forth the date of the termination of the Purchase
Agreement.

                (c)     Procedure.

                        (i)     Buyer shall be entitled to give Notice of
Disbursement to the Company (with contemporaneous delivery to the Escrow Agent)
at any time after the termination of the Purchase Agreement by either Buyer or
the Company pursuant to any provision of Section 9.1 thereof, other than Section
9.1(d). The Company shall be entitled to give Notice of Disbursement to Buyer
(with contemporaneous delivery to the Escrow Agent) at any time after the
termination of the Purchase Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(d)
thereof. The party delivering the Notice of Disbursement is sometimes referred
to herein as the "Notifying Party." The party (Buyer or the Company) to which
the Notice of Disbursement is delivered is sometimes referred to herein as the
"Notified Party."

                        (ii)    In the event that the Notified Party gives
Notice of Non-Objection to the Notifying Party, with contemporaneous delivery to
the Escrow Agent, or does not give Notice of Objection to the Notice of
Disbursement within 60 days of receipt thereof, then upon receipt of such Notice
of Non-Objection or at the end of such 60-day period, as applicable, the Escrow
Agent shall promptly deliver the Deposit Fund to the Notifying Party.

                                        2

<PAGE>

                        (iii)   In the event that the Notified Party gives
Notice of Objection within 60 days of receipt of the Notice of Disbursement,
then Buyer and the Company shall endeavor to resolve the dispute. Buyer and the
Company shall act in good faith to attempt to reach a resolution within 30 days
following the date on which the Notified Party gives Notice of Objection. If
Buyer and the Company are able to agree on a resolution, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Buyer and the Company
and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute the Deposit Fund in
accordance with the terms of the memorandum. If Buyer and the Company are unable
to agree on any resolution within such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent shall not
make any transfers from the Deposit Fund except promptly pursuant to a final
award determined by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can
be timely taken. The Escrow Agent shall take the action specified in joint
notices signed by, and received from, Buyer and the Company as soon as practical
after its receipt thereof.

                        (iv)    Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Section 3, the Escrow Agent shall release and distribute the Deposit Fund
pursuant to any joint written instructions executed by Buyer and the Company or
as directed by a final award determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
from which no appeal can be timely taken.

        4.      Fees of Escrow Agent. Each of Buyer and the Company shall pay
one-half of the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Escrow Agent
incurred by it in connection with carrying out its duties hereunder.

        5.      Rights and Duties of the Escrow Agent.

                (a)     The duties and responsibilities of the Escrow Agent
shall be determined solely by the provisions of this Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have and may exercise such powers hereunder as
are specifically delegated to the Escrow Agent by the terms hereof, together
with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, including the power to
hire attorneys to represent the Escrow Agent with respect to matters arising
from this Agreement and the power to file actions as it deems necessary in a
court of appropriate jurisdiction. The Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties
and no obligation to take any action hereunder except for any action
specifically provided by this Agreement to be taken by the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or obligation of any kind in
connection with this Agreement or the Deposit Fund, and shall not be required to
deliver the same or any part thereof or take any action with respect to any
matters that might arise in connection therewith, other than to receive, hold,
and make delivery of the Deposit Fund as herein provided or by reason of any
order of a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal may timely be
taken. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for any action taken or
omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct or breach of the provisions of this Agreement was the primary cause
of any loss to Buyer or the Company. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the
advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or other skilled person. In
the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights
hereunder or shall

                                        3

<PAGE>

receive instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto which, in its
opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be
entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to
keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise in
writing by all of the parties hereto or by a final order or judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction. Buyer and the Company hereby agree, jointly and
severally, to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Escrow Agent and its
directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the "Indemnitees") from
and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, fines, penalties
and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including incidental expenses and
reasonable legal fees and expenses ("Escrow Agent Losses"), that may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against, the Indemnitees or any of them for
following any instructions or other directions upon which they are authorized to
rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In addition to and not in
limitation of the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer and the Company also
agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold the Indemnitees and each of
them harmless from and against any and all Escrow Agent Losses that may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnitees or any of them in
connection with or arising out of the Escrow Agent's performance under this
Agreement, provided the Indemnitees have not acted with gross negligence or
engaged in willful misconduct or breached the provisions of this Agreement. The
provisions of this Section 5(a) shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent for any reason. The Escrow
Agent may execute any of its duties hereunder by or through employees, agents
and attorneys-in-fact.

                (b)     The Escrow Agent shall have the right to resign after
first having given Buyer and the Company notice in writing of its intent to
resign at least 30 days in advance. At the expiration of such 30 days, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining Deposit Fund to a successor Escrow
Agent designated in writing by Buyer and the Company. If Buyer and the Company
fail to designate a successor to the Escrow Agent within such 30-day period, the
Escrow Agent shall, at the expense of Buyer and the Company, institute a bill of
interpleader as contemplated by Section 5(e)(ii) hereof. Any corporation or
association into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged
or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or
association resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation or
association to which all or substantially all the corporate trust business of
the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be sold or otherwise
transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

                (c)     If (i) the Deposit Fund is at any time attached,
garnished or levied upon under any court order, or (ii) the payment, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or
enjoined by any court order, or (iii) any order, judgment or decree shall be
made or entered by any court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal may
timely be taken affecting such property or any part thereof, then in any of such
events the Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and
comply with any such order, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal
counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, and if it complies with any such
order, judgment or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or
to any other person, firm or corporation by reason of such compliance, even
though such

                                        4

<PAGE>

order, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set
aside or vacated.

                (d)     The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the
accuracy, act in reliance upon the contents and assume the genuineness of any
instruction, direction, request or notice which is given to the Escrow Agent in
proper form pursuant to this Agreement and reasonably believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person,
without the necessity of the Escrow Agent verifying the truth or accuracy
thereof. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to investigate or in any way
determine whether Buyer or the Company is entitled to terminate the Purchase
Agreement.

                (e)     Should any controversy arise between or among Buyer and
the Company or any other person, firm or entity with respect to this Agreement,
the Deposit Fund or any part thereof, or the right of any party or other person
to receive the Deposit Fund, or should Buyer and the Company fail to designate
another Escrow Agent as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, or if the Escrow Agent
should be in doubt as to what action to take, the Escrow Agent shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to (i) withhold delivery of the Deposit Fund
until the controversy is resolved and/or (ii) institute a bill of interpleader
in any court of competent jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties
hereto (the right of the Escrow Agent to institute such bill of interpleader
shall not, however, be deemed to modify the manner in which Escrow Agent is
entitled to make transfers from the Deposit Fund as hereinabove set forth other
than to tender the Deposit Fund into the possession and control of such court).

                (f)     Buyer and the Company may, by joint written direction,
request the resignation of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not be
required to resign until its reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses have
been paid. Such direction shall also include the designation of the successor
Escrow Agent. Upon the turnover of the Deposit Fund to the successor Escrow
Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be released from any further liability or
responsibility in connection therewith other than liability resulting from the
Escrow Agent's gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of the provisions
of this Agreement.

        6.      Term. This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect
until the assets comprising the Deposit Fund have been transferred in accordance
with Section 3 hereof.

        7.      Escrow Earnings.

                (a)     Upon the disbursement of the Deposit Fund, all income,
proceeds, earnings or distributions on the Deposit Fund, after payment of
expenses or taxes incurred in connection therewith, shall be paid to Buyer and
the Company pro rata based on the amount of the Deposit Fund disbursed to such
parties pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, if the Closing under the
Purchase Agreement occurs, all such income, proceeds, earnings or distributions

                (b)     Invalidity. If any one or more of the provisions

                (c)     Survival of Indemnification. Notwithstanding termination

waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or

                (i)     Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and
interpreted, and the rights of the parties shall be determined, in accordance
with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any
provision thereof that would require the application of the substantive laws of
any other jurisdiction, except to the extent that such laws are superseded by

                (m)     Security Procedures. In the event funds transfer
instructions are given, whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise, the
Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by
telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule 1 hereto,
and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be
the person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for
call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged
by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of a party's
authorized representatives identified in Schedule 1, the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to
any one or more of such party's executive officers ("Executive Officers"), which
shall include the titles of Treasurer, Chief Financial and Chief Executive
Officer, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such Executive Officer shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent a fully executed Incumbency Certificate, and the Escrow Agent
may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The
Escrow Agent and the beneficiary's bank in any funds transfer may rely solely
upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by the Company
or Buyer to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary's bank, or (iii)
an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for
any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even when its
use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the
transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary's bank or a designated
intermediary bank. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that these security
procedures are commercially reasonable.

                (n)     TINSs. Upon execution of this Agreement, each of Buyer
and the Company shall provide the Escrow Agent with a fully executed W-8 or W-9
IRS form, which shall include Buyer's and Company's Tax Identification Number.
In addition, all interest or other income earned under the Agreement shall be
allocated and/or paid as directed in a joint written direction of Buyer and the
Company and reported by the recipient to the Internal Revenue Service or other
taxing authority. Notwithstanding such written directions, the Escrow Agent
shall report and, as required, withhold any taxes as it determines may be
required by any law or regulation in effect at the time of the distribution. In
the absence of timely direction, all proceeds of the Deposit Fund shall be
retained in the Deposit Fund and reinvested from time to time by the Escrow
Agent as provided in Section 3. In the event that any earnings remain
undistributed at the end of any calendar year, the Escrow Agent shall report to
the Internal Revenue Service or such other authority such earnings as it deems
appropriate or as required by any applicable law or regulation or, to the extent
consistent therewith, as directed in writing by Buyer and the Company. In
addition, the Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate and
shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.

        This LEASE AGREEMENT ("Lease") is made and entered into as of this ____
day of __________________, 2003, by and between:

                  AK STEEL CORPORATION, A DELAWARE CORPORATION,
            with a principal office and place of business located at
                    703 Curtis Street, Middletown, Ohio 45043
                                  ("Landlord")
                                       and

               NATIONAL STEEL CORPORATION, A DELAWARE CORPORATION,
                                   ("Tenant")

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

        In consideration of the terms, conditions and obligations herein
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

        SECTION 1 -- LEASED PREMISES; PARKING.

        (A)     Landlord hereby leases to Tenant and Tenant hereby leases from
Landlord that certain real property containing approximately, which property is
located on the third floor of the building containing approximately 116,609
square feet (the "Building") located on certain land commonly known as 4100
Edison Lakes Parkway, Mishawaka, St. Joseph County, Indiana, 46545 (the "Land")
and as more particularly described on Exhibit "A-1" attached hereto. A floor
plan depicting such leased premises is provided on Exhibit "A-2" attached hereto
and incorporated herein (hereinafter the "Leased Premises" or the "Premises").

        (B)     Landlord grants Tenant a non-exclusive license to use, in common
with the other Building occupants, the common areas of the Building and the
Land, including, but not limited to, parking areas (subject to subsection (D)
below) (collectively, "Common Areas"), subject to, however, the rules and
regulations attached hereto as Exhibit "B."

        (C)     Without unreasonable interference with Tenant's use of the
Leased Premises, Landlord reserves the right to:

                (1)     install, use, maintain, repair, and replace pipes,
ducts, conduits, wires, and appurtenant meters and equipment for service to
other parts of the Building, above the ceiling surfaces, below the floor
surfaces, within the walls, and in the central core areas, and to relocate any
pipes, ducts, conduits, wires, and appurtenant meters and equipment included in
the Premises which are located in the Leased Premises or outside of the Leased
Premises, and/or to expand the Building; and

                (2)     to alter or relocate any other common facility.

<PAGE>

        (D)     Subject to the limitations set forth herein, Tenant and its
employees and visitors shall have the non-exclusive right to park on the
Building's surface parking facilities in common with other occupants of the
Building on such terms and conditions as Landlord may reasonably establish from
time to time. Landlord reserves the right to limit the number of parking spaces
that Tenant may use to the product of (1) the number of parking spaces available
for parking generally for occupants of the Building and their employees and
visitors, multiplied by (2) Tenant's proportionate share, calculated based on
the ratio that the number of square feet of Leased Premises bears to the total
number of square feet of the Building ("Tenant's Pro Rata Share"). Landlord may
assign specific spaces and may reserve specific spaces in its reasonable
discretion, and Tenant and its employees and visitors shall not park in any such
assigned and/or reserved spaces. Landlord reserves the right to close all or a
portion of the parking areas in order to make repairs or to perform maintenance.
Landlord also reserves the right to relocate all or any parking areas serving

substantially similar to those taken.

        SECTION 2 -- USE.

        Tenant shall use the Leased Premises for the following purposes and no
other: general office purposes.

        SECTION 3 -- TERM; TERMINATION.

this Lease, upon notice given not less than ninety days prior to the end of the
then current term of this Lease, for up to two successive six-month periods
(each, a "Renewal Term").

        (B)     This Lease may be terminated only in accordance with its terms,
and no unilateral termination by Tenant or voluntary surrender of this Lease by
Tenant shall be effective unless such termination or surrender shall be accepted
by Landlord in writing.

        SECTION 4 -- HOLDING OVER.

        (A)     If, without the execution of a new lease or written extension or
written consent of Landlord, Tenant shall hold over after the expiration of the
term of this Lease, Tenant shall be deemed to be occupying the Premises as a
Tenant from month to month, which tenancy may be terminated by Landlord at any
time upon written notice to Tenant, at a rental of ___________________ and
___/100 Dollars ($______.____) per month, it being understood and agreed that
there shall be no additional charge for Operating Expenses, but that Tenant

        (B)     The obligations set forth in this Section 4 shall continue after

($_______.___), payable without demand in equal monthly payments of
______________ and ___/100 Dollars ($_______.___), in advance on or before the
first day of each month, commencing on ___________________, 2003, and continuing
thereafter until the total sum shall be paid. If the Commencement Date occurs on
a day other than the first day of the month, on the Commencement Date, Tenant
shall pay Landlord the pro rata portion of rent for the month in which the
Commencement Date occurs. During each Renewal Term, if any, Tenant agrees to and
shall pay Landlord (at such place as Landlord shall designate from time to time
in writing) as rent for the Leased Premises, the total sum of ______________ and
___/100 Dollars ($_______.___), payable without demand in equal monthly payments

        (B)     Rent received after the first of the month shall be deemed
delinquent. If rent is not received by Landlord by the fifth day of each month,
Tenant shall pay a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the amount due and
not paid. Tenant shall pay Twenty and No/100 Dollars ($20.00) for each check
returned to Landlord by the issuing bank for insufficient funds in the account
upon which such check is drawn.

        (C)     Of the annual rental amount, a portion represents an estimate of
Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the building operation costs and real estate taxes.
The rent shall be adjusted for the Initial Term and each Renewal Term, if any,
to reflect the actual amount of Tenant's Pro Rata Share of real estate taxes and
building operation costs (including but not limited to insurance, custodial
services, maintenance, and utilities) in accordance with Exhibit "C" attached
hereto and incorporated herein.

                                        3

        Tenant shall pay, before delinquency, all taxes, charges, or other
governmental impositions assessed against or levied upon any of Tenant's
personal property or trade fixtures located in or about the Premises and any of
Tenant's improvements or alterations made to the Premises during the term of
this Lease.

        SECTION 7 -- RELOCATION.

Premises be moved for reasons associated with the Building, Landlord shall
notify Tenant pursuant to the notice provisions herein, and Landlord, at its
sole expense and effort, shall have the right, with the consent of Tenant, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to move Tenant to other,
comparable space in the Building. However, the terms and conditions of this
Lease shall remain in full force and effect, and any descriptions, legal and/or

Building and Common Areas, against damage by fire and standard extended coverage
perils, and shall carry commercial general liability insurance, all in such
reasonable amounts with such reasonable deductibles as would be carried by a
prudent owner of a similar building in the area.

                (2)     Landlord may carry any other forms of insurance as it or
its mortgagee may deem advisable. Tenant shall have no right to any proceeds
from such policies.

                (3)     Landlord shall not carry any insurance on any of
Tenant's property, and Landlord shall not be obligated to repair or replace any
of it except to the extent the damage is caused by the negligence or willful
misconduct of Landlord or its employees, officer, agents, or representatives.

                (4)     Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, Landlord
reserves the right to self-insure any of the risks, including casualty, which
would otherwise be covered by policies of insurance hereunder; provided,
however, in the event Landlord carries insurance with a third party carrier,
such policies of insurance shall include (i) waiver of subrogation provisions in
favor of Tenant (provided that Tenant pays any fee or cost associated with such
provision), (ii) provisions requiring that Tenant be given sixty (60) days
notice of any policy cancellation or change (except in the case of non-payment
of premium in which case ten (10) days written notice shall be given) and (iii)
provisions requiring that Tenant be named as an additional insured.

        (D)     Tenant agrees that it will not keep, use, sell, or offer for
sale in or upon the Leased Premises any property which may be prohibited by any
insurance coverage to be maintained by Tenant hereunder.

        SECTION 9 -- INDEMNIFICATION.

        (A)     In the exercise of its rights hereunder, each party agrees to
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party, including its employees,
agents, invitees, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all claims,
costs, demands, damages, liabilities, judgments, or expenses, including
attorneys' fees, court costs, consultant fees, and other legal costs
(collectively, a "Claim"), for any personal injury, death, or property damage or
any other damages of whatever kind or nature whatsoever arising out of or
resulting from, or in any way associated with the activities described herein,
or any act, omission, or neglect, of the indemnifying party, its employees,
agents, invitees, successors, and assigns or the activities of any other party
or entity whatsoever, directly or indirectly, against the indemnified party,
except to the extent any such Claim arises or results from the negligence or
willful misconduct of the indemnified party, its employees, agents, invitees,
successors, or assigns.

        (B)     Landlord and its employees and agents shall not be liable to
Tenant or to Tenant's employees, patrons, visitors, invitees, or any other
persons for any injury to any such persons or for damage to personal property
caused by any act, omission, or neglect of Tenant or Tenant's agents or of any
other tenant of the Premises. Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless, Landlord and its employees and agents from any and all claims for such
injury and damages, whether the injury occurs on or off the Leased Premises,
except to the extent any such claim arises or results from the negligence or
willful misconduct of Landlord, its employees, agents, invitees, successors, or
assigns.

                                        5

<PAGE>

        (C)     Tenant shall pay and indemnify Landlord against all legal costs
and charges, including attorneys' fees lawfully and reasonably incurred, in
obtaining possession of the Leased Premises after default of the Tenant or after
the Tenant defaults in surrendering possession upon the expiration or earlier
termination of the term of this Lease or in enforcing any covenant of the Tenant
herein contained or in re-letting the Leased Premises after a default by Tenant.

        (D)     Each of the parties hereto warrants to the other that, except as
is set forth herein, it has not obligated the other party to pay any finders',
brokers', or other agents' fees in connection with this Lease and each party
shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party, including its
employees, agents, invitees, successors, and assigns, from and against any and
all claims for such fees alleged to have been incurred by such party.

        (E)     The obligations set forth in this Section 9 shall continue after
the termination of this Lease as to any matters that occurred during or resulted
from the term of this Lease.

        SECTION 10 -- ENVIRONMENTAL.

        (A)     Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord
from and against any and all Claims arising from any environmental liability
and/or environmental condition of the Leased Premises arising out of Tenant's
activities during the term of this Lease. For purpose of this provision,
"environmental condition" shall mean any discharge, release, leakage, existence,
seepage, contamination, spillage, or emission (collectively, "Discharge") of any
hazardous substances upon, in, or from the Premises. If, during the term of this
Lease, Tenant bears witness to or receives information from any third party of
personal injury, property damage, or environmental release occurring at or
adjoining the Premises, Tenant shall provide Landlord with immediate notice of
any such event.

                Tenant shall not cause any hazardous wastes, toxic substances,
or toxic or hazardous material (collectively, "Hazardous Materials") to be used,
generated, stored, or disposed of on, under, or about, or transported to or
from, the Premises (collectively, "Hazardous Materials Activities") without
first receiving Landlord's written consent, which may be withheld for any reason
and revoked at any time. If Landlord consents to any such Hazardous Materials
Activities, Tenant shall conduct them in strict compliance (at Tenant's sole
expense) with all applicable laws and regulations, as hereinafter defined, and
using all necessary and appropriate precautions.

        (B)     Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any Hazardous
Materials Activities by Tenant, Tenant's employees, agents, contractors,
licensees, or invitees, whether or not consented to by Landlord. Tenant shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord from and against any Claims
arising out of Tenant's Hazardous Materials Activities during the term of this
Lease. For purposes hereof, Hazardous Materials shall include without limitation
substances defined as "hazardous substances," "toxic substances," or "hazardous
wastes" in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act of 1980; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 ("RCRA"); Hazardous
Materials Transportation

                                        6

<PAGE>

Act, and/or all other applicable federal, state, and local laws and ordinances
governing similar matters and any regulations adopted and publications
promulgated pursuant thereto (collectively "Hazardous Materials Regulations");
provided, however, Hazardous Materials shall not include products customarily
used in the cleaning and operation of office space.

        (C)     Prior to using, storing, or maintaining any Hazardous Materials
on or about the Premises, Tenant shall provide Landlord with a list of the
types, quantities, locations, and uses thereof, and shall update such list as
necessary for continued accuracy. Tenant shall also provide Landlord with a copy
of any Hazardous Materials inventory statement(s) required by any applicable
hazardous Materials Regulation, all MSDS's and any update filed in accordance
with any applicable Hazardous Materials Regulation or registration.

        (D)     If Tenant's activities violate or create a risk of violation of
any Hazardous Materials Regulation, Tenant shall cease such activities
immediately upon notice from Landlord. Tenant shall immediately notify Landlord
both by telephone and in writing of any spill or unauthorized discharge or
release of Hazardous Materials or of any condition constituting an "imminent
hazard" under RCRA.

        (E)     Landlord and Landlord's representatives and employees may enter
the Premises at any time during the term hereof to inspect Tenant's compliance
with the provisions of this Lease.

        (F)     The indemnification obligations set forth in Sections 10(A) and
10(B) shall continue after the termination of this Lease as to any matters that
occurred during or resulted from the term of this Lease.

        SECTION 11 -- UTILITIES; SERVICES PROVIDED BY LANDLORD.

        (A)     Tenant shall pay Landlord, as additional rent, Tenant's Pro Rata
Share of the amounts payable by Landlord for utilities (the "Utilities Expense")
during the term of this Lease. The Utilities Expense shall be payable as and
when such amounts are payable by Landlord to the provider of such utilities.
Landlord shall, promptly upon request by Tenant, furnish Tenant with copies of
the utilities statements received by Landlord. Landlord shall pay for those
services identified on Exhibit "C" attached hereto and incorporated herein and
Tenant shall pay Tenant's Pro Rata Share of such services, as additional rent,
in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(C) hereof. Tenant shall pay all
charges for any other services used in or about or supplied to the Leased
Premises, and shall indemnify Landlord against any liability on such account.

        (B)     Landlord or Landlord's agent may not interrupt or cause the
interruption of utility service to the Leased Premises or the Common Areas
unless interruption results from bona fide repairs, construction, or an
emergency. If any such utility services are interrupted and continue to be
interrupted despite the good faith efforts of Landlord to remedy same, Landlord
shall not be liable in any respect for damages to the person or property of
Tenant or Tenant's employees, agents, or guests, and same shall not be construed
as grounds for constructive eviction or abatement of rent; provided, however, in
the event such interruption continues for more than ten (10) consecutive days
and renders the Leased Premises uninhabitable or unusable

                                        7

<PAGE>

by Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to terminate the Lease. Landlord shall
use reasonable diligence to repair and remedy such interruption promptly.

        (C)     The payment obligations set forth in this Section 11 shall
continue after the termination of this Lease as to any matters that occurred
during or resulted from the term of this Lease.

        SECTION 12 -- CONDITION OF PREMISES; IMPROVEMENTS, MAINTENANCE, AND
REPAIRS.

        (A)     Tenant has examined and accepts the Leased Premises in its
present "AS IS" condition as suitable for the purposes for which the same are
leased, and does hereby accept the Leased Premises regardless of reasonable
deterioration between the date of this Lease and the date Tenant begins
occupying the Leased Premises unless Landlord and Tenant agree that Landlord
shall make repairs and/or improvements or refurbishment as may be identified in
Exhibit "E" attached hereto and incorporated herein.

        (B)     Landlord shall keep the foundation, the exterior walls
(including, without limitation: glass; windows; doors; door closure devices;
window and door frames, molding, locks, and hardware; and painting and other
treatment of exterior walls), the Common Areas, the interior of the Building,
and the roof of the Building in good repair and condition, except that Tenant
shall reimburse Landlord for any repairs occasioned by the willful misconduct or
negligence of Tenant, its employees, subtenants, licensees, or concessionaires.
Tenant agrees to give Landlord written notice of needed repairs of which Tenant
is aware. Landlord shall make such repairs within a reasonable time. Tenant
shall notify Landlord immediately of any emergency repairs of which Tenant is
aware. Tenant shall keep the Leased Premises in good clean condition and shall,
at its sole cost and expense, make all needed repairs and replacements thereof,
except for repairs and replacements required to be made by Landlord under this
Section 12. If any repairs required to be made by Tenant hereunder are not made
within ten (10) days after written notice delivered to Tenant by Landlord,
Landlord may at its option make such repairs without liability to Tenant for any
loss or damage which may result by reason of such repairs, except to the extent
such loss or damage arises or results from the negligence or willful misconduct
of Landlord or its employees or agents, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon
demand as additional rent hereunder the cost of such repairs plus interest
thereon at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum from the date of such payment
by Landlord until repaid by Tenant. At the termination of this Lease, Tenant
shall deliver the Leased Premises in good order and condition, normal wear and
tear excepted. Normal wear and tear means deterioration which occurs without
negligence, carelessness, accident, or abuse.

        (C)     Tenant shall make no alterations, decorations, additions, or
improvements in or to the Leased Premises without Landlord's prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and then only by contractors
or mechanics approved in writing by Landlord. Tenant agrees that there shall be
no construction of partitions or other obstructions which might interfere with
Landlord's free access to mechanical installations or service facilities of the
Building or with moving of Landlord's equipment to or from the enclosures
containing said installations or facilities. All such work shall be done at such
times and in such manner as Landlord may from time to time designate. Tenant
covenants and agrees that all work

                                        8

<PAGE>

done by Tenant shall be performed in full compliance with all laws, rules,
orders, ordinances, directions, regulations, and requirements of all
governmental agencies having jurisdiction. Before commencing any work approved
by Landlord, Tenant shall give Landlord at least five (5) days written notice of
the proposed commencement of such work and shall, if required by Landlord,
secure at Tenant's own cost and expense, a completion and lien indemnity bond,
satisfactory to Landlord, for said work. All alterations, decorations,
additions, or improvements upon the Leased Premises (other than Tenant's trade
fixtures), made by either party, including without limitation, all
wallcoverings, built-in cabinet work, paneling, and the like, shall, unless
Landlord elects otherwise, become the property of Landlord, and shall remain
upon and be surrendered with, the Premises as a part thereof at the termination
of this Lease; except, however, Landlord may, by written notice to Tenant, given
at least thirty (30) days prior to the termination of this Lease, require Tenant
to remove all partitions, counters, railings and the like installed by Tenant
during the term of this Lease, and Tenant shall repair any damage to the
Premises from such removal or, at Landlord's option, shall pay to Landlord all
of Landlord's costs of such removal and repair.

        (D)     In the event the Leased Premises are partially damaged or
destroyed or rendered partially unfit for occupancy by fire or other casualty,
Tenant shall give immediate notice to Landlord. Landlord may repair the damage
and restore the Leased Premises to substantially the same condition as
immediately prior to the occurrence of the casualty. Such repairs shall be made
at Landlord's expense unless due to the negligence or willful misconduct of
Tenant or its employees, agents, or invitees. Landlord shall allow Tenant a fair
reduction of rent during the time the Leased Premises are partially unfit for
occupancy. If the Leased Premises are totally destroyed or deemed by the
Landlord to be rendered unfit for occupancy by fire or other casualty or if
Landlord shall decide not to repair or rebuild after a casualty, this Lease
shall terminate and the rent shall be paid through the time of such casualty.

        SECTION 13 -- TENANT DEFAULT AND REMOVAL OF ABANDONED PROPERTY.

        If Tenant abandons the Premises or if Tenant breaches any covenant,
warranty, term, or other obligation of this Lease, then Tenant's failure to cure
same within ten (10) days thereafter shall be considered a default (provided,
that Tenant's failure to make any payment of rent or Utilities Expense on the
due date therefor shall be an immediate default) and, in the event of a default,
Landlord may enforce the performance of this Lease in any manner provided by
law. This Lease may be terminated at Landlord's discretion if such abandonment
or default, including any payment default, continues for a period of ten (10)
days after Landlord notifies Tenant of such abandonment or default and of
Landlord's intention to declare this Lease terminated. If Tenant has not
completely removed or cured the default within the 10-day period, this Lease
shall terminate. Thereafter, Landlord or its agents shall have the right,
without further notice or demand, to enter the Leased Premises and remove all
property without being deemed guilty of trespass and without waiving any other
remedies for arrearages of rent or breach of covenant. Upon abandonment or
default by the Tenant, the remaining unpaid portion of the rent from Section 5
herein, shall become due and payable.

                                        9

<PAGE>

Tenant is presumed to have abandoned the Premises if goods, equipment, or other
property, in an amount substantial enough to indicate a probable intent to
abandon the Premises, is being or has been removed from the Premises and the
removal is not within the normal course of Tenant's business. Landlord shall
have the right to store any property of Tenant that remains on the Premises that
have been abandoned; and, in addition to Landlord's other rights, Landlord may
dispose of the stored property if Tenant does not claim the property within
sixty (60) days after the date the property is stored, provided Landlord
notifies Tenant that Landlord may dispose of Tenant's property if Tenant does
not claim the property within sixty (60) days after the date the property is
stored.

        SECTION 14 -- DEFAULT BY LANDLORD.

        In the event of breach by Landlord of any covenant, warranty, term, or
obligation of this Lease, then Landlord's failure to cure same or commence a
good faith effort to cure same within ten (10) days after written notice thereof
by Tenant shall be considered a default and shall entitle Tenant either to
terminate this Lease or cure the default, and any expense incurred by Tenant
shall be reimbursed by the Landlord after reasonable notice of the expenses
incurred.

        SECTION 15 -- WAIVER OF BREACH.

        The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Lease
shall not constitute a continuing waiver or a waiver of any subsequent breach of
the same or a different provision of this Lease.

        SECTION 16 -- EXCLUSION OF TENANT; LANDLORD RIGHT OF ENTRY.

        (A)     Landlord may not intentionally prevent Tenant from entering the
Leased Premises, except by judicial process, unless the exclusion results from:
(1) bona fide repairs, construction, or an emergency; (2) removing the contents
of Premises abandoned by Tenant; or (3) changing the door locks of Tenant in the
event Tenant is in default beyond the 10-day cure period in paying any potion of
the rent. If Landlord or Landlord's agent changes the door locks of Tenant as
permitted herein, Landlord or Landlord's agent must place a written notice on
Tenant's front door stating the name and the address or telephone number of a
contact person.

        (B)     Landlord shall have the right, upon reasonable prior notice,
during normal business hours to enter the Leased Premises: (1) to inspect the
general condition and state of repair thereof; (2) to make repairs required or
permitted under this Lease; or (3) for any other reasonable purpose. For each of
the aforesaid purposes, Landlord shall at all times have and retain a key with
which to unlock all of the doors in, upon, and about the Premises and Landlord
shall have the right to use any and all means which Landlord may deem proper to
open said doors in an emergency in order to obtain entry to the Premises, and
any damages caused on account thereof shall be paid by Tenant, except for
damages caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or its
employees or agents. Tenant hereby waives any claim for damages for any

                                       10

<PAGE>

injury or inconvenience to or interference with Tenant's business, any loss of
occupancy or quiet enjoyment of the Premises, and any other loss occasioned
thereby as a result of such entry by Landlord made pursuant to Section 16.
Tenant shall not change the locks on any entry way without first obtaining the
written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. In any such event, Tenant's new locks shall be tied into Landlord's
master locking system for the Premises.

        SECTION 17 -- COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATION.

        (A)     With respect to the Leased Premises, Tenant shall, at its own
expense, comply with all laws, orders, and requirements of all governmental
entities with reference to the use and occupancy of the Leased Premises. Tenant
and Tenant's agents, employees, and invitees shall comply with any rules and
regulations governing the use of the Buildings or other improvements to the
Leased Premises as reasonably required by Landlord. Landlord may make reasonable
changes in any such rules and regulations from time to time as deemed advisable
for the safety, care, and cleanliness of the Building, provided the same are in
writing and are not in conflict with this Lease. See Rules and Regulations
attached hereto as Exhibit "B" and incorporated herein.

        (B)     Tenant shall pay any and all fines or penalties imposed or
allegedly imposed for failure to comply with this Section 17 and shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord from any claims, demands, or
actions by governments, their agencies, boards or commissions and private
parties, arising as a result of Tenant's failure to comply with this Section 17.

        (C)     Tenant shall obtain any permits as required in connection with
its use and occupancy of the Leased Premises, and shall promptly provide copies
thereof to Landlord.

        (D)     Landlord does not warrant or represent that the Leased Premises
are suitable or safe for the purpose intended in Section 3 hereof.

        (E)     The indemnification obligations set forth in Section 17(B) shall
continue after the expiration or termination of this Lease as to any matters
that occurred during or resulted from the term of this Lease.

        SECTION 18 -- CONSTRUCTION.

        (A)     This Agreement shall be construed under and in accordance with
the laws of the State of Indiana.

        (B)     In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
in any respect, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision hereof and this Agreement shall be construed as if
such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had never been contained
herein.

<PAGE>

        SECTION 19 -- BINDING; RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

        (A)     Subject to the provisions of this Lease pertaining to assignment
of the Tenant's interest, all provisions of this Lease shall extend to and bind
or inure to the benefit not only of the parties to this Lease, but to each and
every one of the heirs, executors, representatives, successors and assigns of
Landlord or Tenant.

        (B)     The rights and remedies set forth in this Lease are cumulative
and the use of any one right or remedy by either party shall not preclude or
waive its right to use any or all other remedies. Said rights and remedies are
in addition to any other rights the parties may have by law, statute, ordinance
or otherwise.

        SECTION 20 -- LIEN; SUBORDINATION.

        (A)     Landlord is granted an express contractual lien, in addition to
any lien provided by law, and a security interest in, all property of Tenant
found on the Leased Premises to secure the compliance by Tenant with all terms
of this Lease.

        (B)     Landlord is hereby irrevocably vested with full power and
authority to subordinate this Lease to any mortgage, deed of trust, or other
lien hereafter placed on the Leased Premises, and Tenant agrees on demand to
execute promptly such further instruments in reasonable form and substance
subordinating this Lease as Landlord may request, provided such subordination
shall be on the express condition that this Lease shall be recognized by the
mortgagee, and the rights of Tenant shall remain in full force and effect during
the term of this Lease so long as Tenant shall continue to perform all of the
covenants and conditions of this Lease.

        SECTION 21 -- NOTICES.

        (A)     Tenant shall not assign this Lease nor sublet the Leased
Premises or any interest therein without first obtaining the written consent of
the Landlord. An assignment or subletting without the written consent of
Landlord shall be void and shall, at the option of Landlord, terminate this
Lease.

        (B)     No amendment, modification, or alteration of the terms hereof
shall be binding unless it is in writing, dated subsequent to the date hereof,
and duly executed by the parties.

        (C)     This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties
to this Lease with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior
understandings or written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

        (D)     Nothing contained herein will be deemed or construed by the
parties hereto, nor by any third party, as creating the relationship of
principal and agent or of partnership or of joint venture between the parties
hereto, it being understood and agreed that neither the computation of rent, nor
any other provision

                                       13

contained herein, nor any acts of the parties herein, shall be deemed to create
any relationship between the parties hereto other than the relationship of
Landlord and Tenant.

        SECTION 23 -- SIGNS.

        (A)     Tenant shall not post or paint any signs at, on, or about the
Leased Premises or paint the exterior walls of the building without prior
written consent of the Landlord. Landlord shall have the right to remove any
sign or signs in order to maintain the Leased Premises or to make any repairs or
alterations thereto.

        (B)     During the last sixty (60) days of this Lease, a "For Sale" sign
and/or a "For Lease" sign may be displayed on the Leased Premises and the Leased

        Tenant commenced a case on March 6, 2002 under chapter 11 of title 11 of
the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. Sections 101 et seq. (the "Bankruptcy Code")
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois,
Eastern Division (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Lease payments, and any other amounts
owing by Tenant to Landlord in accordance with the provisions of this Lease,
shall be entitled to administrative expense claim status under the Bankruptcy
Code.

        SECTION 25 -- CONDEMNATION.

        If the whole or any substantial part of the Leased Premises is taken for
any public or quasi-public use under any governmental law, ordinance, or
regulation or by right of eminent domain or should the Leased Premises be sold
to a condemning authority under threat of condemnation, this Lease, at the
option of either party, shall terminate and the rent shall be abated during the
unexpired portion of the Lease effective from the date of the physical taking of
the Leased Premises. In the event of a taking which does not result in the
termination of this Lease, the rent shall be reduced in proportion to the
portion of the Leased Premises no longer usable by Tenant. Tenant shall be
entitled to a separate award from the condemning authority, to the extent it
does not reduce Landlord's award.

        SECTION 26 -- AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT OF 1991.

        The United States Congress has enacted the Americans With Disabilities
Act (the "ADA"). Among other things, this Act is intended to make many business
establishments equally accessible to persons with a variety of disabilities;
therefore, modifications to real property may be required. State and local laws
also may mandate changes. Landlord shall be responsible for making any
modifications to the Leased Premises required as a result of amendments to the
ADA or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder which become effective
during the term of this Lease.

        (B)     No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount
than the rent payment herein stipulated shall be deemed to be other than an
account of the rent, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any
letter accompanying any check or payment as rent be deemed satisfactory, and
Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right
to recover the balance of such rent or pursue any other remedy provided in this
Lease. Tenant agrees that each of the foregoing covenants and agreements shall
be applicable to any covenant or agreement either expressly contained in this
Lease or imposed by any statute or at common law.

                                afforded to said Additional Insureds.

                        (ix)    Waiver of subrogation shall be provided to the

                        (x)     No XCU (explosion, collapse, underground)
                                exclusion.

                        (xi)    For any claims related herein, the Tenant's

                                definition, or endorsement which would serve to
                                eliminate third-party action over claims.

                        (xiii)  Self-funded or other non-risk transfer insurance
                                mechanisms are not acceptable to AKS (other than
                                customary deductibles or self-insured
                                retentions). If the Tenant has such a program,
                                full disclosure must be made to AKS prior to any
                                consideration being given.

                B.      Workers' Compensation Insurance: As required by the
State or Commonwealth in which the Building is located.

                C.      Employer's Liability: Coverages per accident,
disease-policy limit, and disease each employee.

        2.      MINIMUM LIMITS OF INSURANCE -- Tenant and its Contractor(s)
shall maintain limits no less than:

                A.      Commercial General Liability: Including Umbrella
Liability Insurance, if necessary, limits shall be not less than $2,000,000 each
occurrence for bodily injury and property damage; $2,000,000 each occurrence and
aggregate for products and completed operations; $4,000,000 general aggregate.

                B.      Workers' Compensation: As required by the State or
Commonwealth in which the Building is located.

                C.      Employer's Liability: $1,000,000 per accident,
$1,000,000 disease-policy limit, and $1,000,000 disease each employee. (May

        3.      DEDUCTIBLES AND SELF-INSURED RETENTIONS -- All insurance
coverage carried by Tenant and its Contractor(s) shall extend to and protect
AKS, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates to the full amount of such coverage, and
all deductibles and/or self-insured retentions (if any), including those
relating to defense costs, are the sole responsibility of Tenant and its
Contractor(s).

        4.      RATING OF INSURER -- Insurers must have a minimum rating of a A-
as evaluated by the most current A.M. Best rating guide. If the insurer has a
rating less than an A-, the Contractor must receive specific written approval
from AKS prior to proceeding.

        5.      OTHER INSURANCE PROVISIONS

                A.      Each insurance policy required by this clause shall be
endorsed to state that coverage shall not be suspended, voided, canceled by
either party, or reduced in coverage or in limits except after sixty (60) days
prior written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, has been given
to AKS (except in the case of non-payment of premium, in which event ten (10)
days prior written notice shall be given).

                B.      These insurance provisions are intended to be a separate
and distinct obligation on the part of the Tenant. Therefore, these provisions
shall be enforceable and Tenant and/or

                                        2

<PAGE>

Contractor(s) shall be bound thereby regardless of whether or not indemnity
provisions are determined to be enforceable in the jurisdiction in which the
work covered hereunder is performed.

                C.      The above-described insurance coverage to be provided by
Tenant and/or its Contractor(s) hereunder will extend coverage to all work or
services performed hereunder.

                D.      The obligation of the Tenant and its Contractor(s) to
provide the insurance herein above specified shall not limit in any way the
liability or obligations assumed by the Tenant and its Contractor(s) hereunder.

                E.      In the event Tenant and its Contractor(s) or its
insurance carrier defaults on any obligations hereunder, Tenant and its
Contractor(s) agree that they will be liable for all reasonable expenses and
attorneys' fees incurred by AKS to enforce the provisions hereunder.

        6.      EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE

                A.      Tenant and its Contractor(s) shall furnish AKS with
copies of the endorsements effecting the coverage required by this
specification. Additionally, prior to the commencement of any work or services
on AKS's Premises, Tenant and its Contractor(s) and all subcontractors, if any,
shall furnish to AKS reasonably satisfactory Certificates of Insurance
evidencing full compliance with the requirements herein. The Certificates of
Insurance must show that the required insurance is in force, the amount of the
carrier's liability thereunder, and must further provide that AKS will be given
sixty (60) days advance written notice of any cancellation of coverage or
deletion of the certificate holder herein as an Additional Insured under the
policies (except in the case of non-payment of premium, in which event ten (10)
days prior written notice shall be given).

                B.      All Certificates of Insurance shall be in form and
content reasonably acceptable to AKS and shall be submitted to AKS in a timely
manner so as to confirm Tenant and its Contractor(s) full compliance with the
stated insurance requirements hereunder.

                C.      Any failure on the part of AKS to pursue or obtain the
Certificates of Insurance required hereunder from Tenant and its Contractor(s)
and/or the failure of AKS to point out any non-compliance of such Certificates
of Insurance shall not constitute a waiver of any of the insurance requirements
hereunder, nor relieve Tenant or its Contractor(s) of any of its obligations or
liabilities hereunder. Moreover, acceptance by AKS of insurance submitted by the
Tenant and its Contractors does not relieve or decrease in any manner the
liability of the Tenant and its Contractor(s) for performance hereunder. The
Tenant and its Contractor(s) are responsible for any losses, claims, and/or
costs of any kind which their insurance does not cover.

        7.      SUBCONTRACTORS -- Contractor(s) shall be responsible for
obtaining separate certificates from each subcontractor. All coverages for
subcontractors shall be subject to all of the requirements stated herein.

accordance with Section 3(b) hereof have been transferred to Buyer with respect
to each Notice of Claim which has been given by Buyer on or prior to the

Buyer is then outstanding, then within 10 days the Escrow Agent shall disburse
the balance of the Indemnity Fund to the Company and likewise shall make the
disbursements, if any, described in Section 8 below.

                        (ii)    If Buyer has made any Claim against the
Indemnity Fund to which the Company has timely given Notice of Objection or may
give a timely Notice of Objection and which remains outstanding as of the
Indemnity Termination Date, the balance of the Indemnity Fund that is in excess
of the Claim Amounts subject to the outstanding Claim or Claims shall be
transferred to the Company within such 10-day period, and the Claim Amounts
subject to such outstanding Claim or Claims shall remain in the Indemnity Fund
and shall continue to be administered in accordance with the terms hereof.
Within 10 days following the resolution of each outstanding Claim pending on the
Indemnity Termination Date and the disbursement of any Claim Amounts to which
Buyer is entitled upon resolution of such Claim, that amount initially subject
to such Claim that is in excess of the Claim Amounts disbursed to Buyer, if any,
pursuant to the resolution of such Claim, shall be disbursed to Company. At such
time, the Escrow Agent shall make the disbursements described in Section 8.

                        (iii)   Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Section 3, the Escrow Agent shall release and disburse the Indemnity Fund to the
Indemnification Parties pursuant to any joint written instructions executed by
the Indemnification Parties or as directed by a final award determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be timely taken.

        4.      RESERVED.

        5.      Fees of Escrow Agent. Each of Buyer and the Company shall pay
one-half of the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Escrow Agent
incurred by it in connection with carrying out its duties hereunder.

        6.      Rights and Duties of the Escrow Agent.

                (a)     The duties and responsibilities of the Escrow Agent
shall be determined solely by the provisions of this Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have and may exercise such powers hereunder as
are specifically delegated to the Escrow Agent by the terms hereof, together
with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, including the power to
hire attorneys to represent the Escrow Agent with respect to matters arising
from this Agreement and the power to file actions as it deems necessary in a
court of appropriate jurisdiction. The Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties
and no obligation to take any action hereunder except for any action
specifically provided by this Agreement to be taken by the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or obligation of any kind in
connection with this Agreement or the Indemnity Fund, and shall not be required
to deliver the same or any part thereof or take any action with respect to any
matters that might arise in connection therewith, other than to receive, hold,
and make delivery of the Indemnity Fund as herein provided or by reason of any
order of a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal may timely be
taken. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for any action taken or
omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct or breach of the provisions of this Agreement was the primary cause
of any loss to Buyer or the Company. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the
advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or other skilled person. In
the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights
hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto
which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it
shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation
shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed
otherwise in writing by all of the parties hereto or by a final order or
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Buyer and the Company hereby
agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Escrow
Agent and its directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the
"Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, fines, penalties and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
incidental expenses and reasonable legal fees and expenses ("Escrow Agent
Losses"), that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against, the
Indemnitees or any of them for following any instructions or other directions
upon which they are authorized to rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
In addition to and not in limitation of the immediately preceding sentence,
Buyer and the Company also agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold
the Indemnitees and each of them harmless from and against any and all Escrow
Agent Losses that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Indemnitees or any of them in connection with or arising out of the Escrow
Agent's performance under this Agreement, provided the Indemnitees have not
acted with gross negligence or engaged in willful misconduct or breached the
provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 6(a) shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent for any reason. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its duties hereunder
by or through employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact.

                (b)     The Escrow Agent shall have the right to resign after
first having given the Indemnification Parties notice in writing of its intent
to resign at least 30 days in advance. At the

                                        4

<PAGE>

expiration of such 30 days, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining
Indemnity Fund to a successor Escrow Agent designated in writing by the
Indemnification Parties. If the Indemnification Parties fail to designate a
successor to the Escrow Agent within such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent shall,
at the expense of the Indemnification Parties, institute a bill of interpleader
as contemplated by Section 6(e)(ii) hereof. Any corporation or association into
which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation or association to which
all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity may be sold or otherwise transferred, shall be the Escrow
Agent under this Agreement without further act.

                (c)     If (i) the Indemnity Fund is at any time attached,
garnished or levied upon under any court order, or (ii) the payment, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or
enjoined by any court order, or (iii) any order, judgment or decree shall be
made or entered by any court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal may
timely be taken affecting such property or any part thereof, then in any of such
events the Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and
comply with any such order, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal
counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, and if it complies with any such
order, judgment or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or
to any other person, firm or corporation by reason of such compliance, even
though such order, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.

                (d)     The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the
accuracy, act in reliance upon the contents and assume the genuineness of any
instruction, direction, request or notice which is given to the Escrow Agent in
proper form pursuant to this Agreement and reasonably believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person,
without the necessity of the Escrow Agent verifying the truth or accuracy
thereof. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to investigate or in any way
determine whether Buyer is entitled to indemnification under the Purchase
Agreement or the proper amount of any such indemnification.

                (e)     Should any controversy arise between or among the
Indemnification Parties or any other person, firm or entity with respect to this
Agreement, the Indemnity Fund or any part thereof, or the right of any party or
other person to receive the Indemnity Fund, or should the Indemnification
Parties fail to designate another Escrow Agent as provided in Section 6(b)
hereof, or if the Escrow Agent should be in doubt as to what action to take, the
Escrow Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to (i) withhold
delivery of the Indemnity Fund until the controversy is resolved and/or (ii)
institute a bill of interpleader in any court of competent jurisdiction to
determine the rights of the parties hereto (the right of the Escrow Agent to
institute such bill of interpleader shall not, however, be deemed to modify the
manner in which Escrow Agent is entitled to make transfers from the Indemnity
Fund as hereinabove set forth other than to tender the Indemnity Fund into the
possession and control of such court).

                                        5

<PAGE>

                (f)     Buyer and the Company may, by joint written direction,
request the resignation of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not be
required to resign until its reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses have
been paid. Such direction shall also include the designation of the successor
Escrow Agent. Upon the turnover of the Indemnity Fund to the successor Escrow
Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be released from any further liability or
responsibility in connection therewith other than liability resulting from the
Escrow Agent's gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of the provisions
of this Agreement.

        7.      Term. This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect
until the assets comprising the Indemnity Fund have been transferred in
accordance with Section 3 hereof.

        8.      Escrow Earnings.

                (a)     Following the expiration of the Escrow Period or upon
such later final disposition of the Escrow Amount, all income, proceeds,
earnings or distributions on the Indemnity Fund, after payment of expenses or
taxes incurred in connection therewith, shall be paid to Buyer and the Company
pro rata based on the amount of the Indemnity Fund disbursed to such parties
pursuant to this Agreement. All such earnings shall be reported by the Escrow
Agent to the recipients thereof in the calendar year in which such earnings are
paid.

                (b)     The Escrow Agent shall invest any cash in the Indemnity
Fund at the written direction of both Buyer and the Company or in the absence
of such direction in the Fifth Third U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund or any
other mutual fund invested solely in United States Treasury obligations for
which the Escrow Agent or an affiliate of the Escrow Agent serves as investment
manager, administrator, shareholder servicing agent, or custodian or
subcustodian, notwithstanding that (i) the Escrow Agent or an affiliate of the
Escrow Agent receives fees from such funds for services rendered, (ii) the
Escrow Agent charges and collects fees for services rendered pursuant to this
Agreement, which fees are separate from the fees received from such funds, and
(iii) services performed for such funds and pursuant to this Agreement may at
times duplicate those provided to such funds by the Escrow Agent or its
affiliates. Until further written notice, the Escrow Agent shall invest any
cash in the Indemnity Fund in the Fifth Third U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund.
The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss sustained as a result of
such investment, or any investment made pursuant to the instructions of the
parties hereto or as a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its
maturity.

        9.      Miscellaneous.

                (a)     Time Periods. Whenever under the terms hereof the time
for giving a notice or performing an act falls upon a day other than a Business
Day, such time shall be extended to the next Business Day.

                (b)     Invalidity. If any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement or in any other instrument referred to herein shall,
for any reason, be held to be

                                        6

<PAGE>

invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the parties shall use their
reasonable efforts, including the amendment of this Agreement, to ensure that
this Agreement shall reflect as closely as practicable the intent of the parties
hereto on the date hereof.

                (c)     Survival of Indemnification. Notwithstanding termination
of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 6(a) shall remain in full force and
effect for so long as the Escrow Agent may have any liability.

                (d)     Default. Any party hereto may (i) extend the time for
the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto or (ii)
waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition, of this Agreement.

                (e)     Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents,
approvals or other communications (collectively, "Notices") required or
permitted to be given hereunder or that are given with respect to this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be personally served, delivered by a nationally
recognized overnight delivery service with charges prepaid, or transmitted by
hand delivery, or facsimile, addressed as set forth below, or to such other
address as such party shall have specified most recently by written Notice.
Notice shall be deemed given on the date of service or transmission if
personally served or transmitted by facsimile with confirmation of receipt;
provided, that if delivered or transmitted on a day other than a Business Day or
after normal business hours, notice shall be deemed given on the next Business
Day. Notice otherwise sent as provided herein shall be deemed given on the next
Business Day following timely deposit of such Notice with an overnight delivery
service:

Rejection of or refusal to accept any Notice, or the inability to deliver any

                (g)     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Counterparts to this
Agreement may be delivered via facsimile. In proving this Agreement, it shall
not be necessary to produce or account for more than one such counterpart signed

                (h)     Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except by a written agreement signed by each of the parties hereto.

                (i)     Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and
interpreted, and the rights of the parties shall be determined, in accordance
with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any
provision thereof that would require the application of the substantive laws of
any other jurisdiction, except to the extent that such laws are superseded by
the Bankruptcy Code.

                                        8

<PAGE>

                (j)     Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement
and all agreements entered into pursuant hereto and all certificates and
instruments delivered pursuant hereto and thereto constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
Buyer, the Company and the Escrow Agent with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

                (k)     Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of
any nature under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided
herein.

                (l)     Exclusive Jurisdiction. Without limiting any party's
right to appeal any order of the Bankruptcy Court, (a) the Bankruptcy Court
shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement and
to decide (insofar as they relate to the Company) any claims or disputes which
may arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any breach or
default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) any and all
claims, actions, causes of action, suits and proceedings related to the
foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the
parties hereby consent to and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the
Bankruptcy Court.

                (m)     Security Procedures. In the event funds transfer
instructions are given, whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise, the
Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by
telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule 1 hereto,
and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be
the person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for
call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged
by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of a party's
authorized representatives identified in Schedule 1, the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to
any one or more of such party's executive officers ("Executive Officers"), which
shall include the titles of ________________________, as the Escrow Agent may
select. Such Executive Officer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully
executed Incumbency Certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow Agent and
the beneficiary's bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account
numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by the Company or Buyer to
identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary's bank, or (iii) an
intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any
payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even when its use
may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of
funds to a bank other than the beneficiary's bank or a designated intermediary
bank. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that these security procedures
are commercially reasonable.

                (n)     TINSs. Upon execution of this Agreement, each of Buyer
and the Company shall provide the Escrow Agent with a fully executed W-8 or W-9
IRS form, which shall include Buyer's and Company's Tax Identification Number.
In addition, all interest or other income earned under the Agreement shall be
allocated and/or paid as directed in a joint written

                                        9

<PAGE>

direction of Buyer and the Company and reported by the recipient to the Internal
Revenue Service or other taxing authority. Notwithstanding such written
directions, the Escrow Agent shall report and, as required, withhold any taxes
as it determines may be required by any law or regulation in effect at the time
of the distribution. In the absence of timely direction, all proceeds of the
Indemnity Fund shall be retained in the Indemnity Fund and reinvested from time
to time by the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 3. In the event that any
earnings remain undistributed at the end of any calendar year, the Escrow Agent
shall report to the Internal Revenue Service or such other authority such
earnings as it deems appropriate or as required by any applicable law or
regulation or, to the extent consistent therewith, as directed in writing by
Buyer and the Company. In addition, the Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it
deems appropriate and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.

respect to the Debtors' motion (the "Sale Motion") for an order authorizing
(i) the sale of certain of the Debtors' Assets relating to the Business, free
and clear of all liens, claims, interests, and encumbrances (the "Sale"),
pursuant to and as described in the Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 30,
2003 (the "Agreement"), by and among the Debtors and AK Steel Corporation (the
"Buyer"), (ii) the Debtors' assumption and assignment to the Buyer of certain
executory contracts and unexpired leases (the "Assumed Contacts"), pursuant to,
limited by, and as described in the Agreement, free and clear of liens, claims,
interests, and encumbrances, and (iii) the assumption by the Buyer of certain

the Motion is in the best interests of the Debtors, their estates and creditors
and other parties in interest; and upon the record of the Hearing; and after due
deliberation thereon; and good cause appearing therefor, it is hereby

                                        2

<PAGE>

                FOUND AND DETERMINED THAT:/2/

                A. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter and over the
property of the Debtors and their respective bankruptcy estates pursuant to 28
U.S.C. Section 1334 and Section 157(a).

                B. This is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section
157(b)(2)(A), (N) and (O).

                C. The Debtors have articulated good and sufficient reasons for
approving (i) the manner of notice of the Sale Motion, the Sale Hearing and the
assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts, (ii) the form of notice of
the Sale Motion and the Sale Hearing (the "Sale Notice") to be distributed to
creditors and other parties in interest, including prospective bidders, (iii)
the form of notices of the cure amounts and the assumption of the Assumed
Contracts to be filed with the Court and served on parties to each Assumed
Contract, (iv) the Bidding Procedures and (iv) the Topping Fee for the Buyer.

                D. The Debtors' payment to the Buyer (as set forth in the
Agreement), of the Topping Fee (a) is an actual and necessary cost and expense
of preserving the Debtors' estates, within the meaning of section 503(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code, (b) is of substantial benefit to the Debtors' estates, (c) is
reasonable and appropriate, including in light of the size and nature of the
Sale and the efforts that have been and will be expended

        conclusions of law shall be construed as findings of fact when
        appropriate. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052.

by the Buyer notwithstanding that the proposed Sale is subject to higher or
better offers for the Business, (d) was negotiated by the parties at arms'
length and in good faith, and (e) is necessary to ensure that the Buyer will
continue to pursue its proposed acquisition of the Business. The Topping Fee was
a material inducement for, and condition of, the Buyer's entry into the
Agreement. The Buyer is unwilling to commit to hold open its offer to purchase
the Business under the terms of the Agreement unless it is assured payment of
the Topping Fee. Thus, assurance to the Buyer of payment of the Topping Fee has
promoted more competitive bidding by inducing the Buyer's bid that otherwise
would not have been made, and without which bidding would have been limited.
Further, because the Topping Fee induced the Buyer to research the value of the
Business and submit a bid that will serve as a minimum or floor bid on which
other bidders can rely, the Buyer has provided a benefit to the Debtors' estates
by increasing the likelihood that the price at which the Business is sold will
reflect its true worth. Finally, absent authorization of the Topping Fee, the
Debtors may lose the opportunity to obtain the highest and best available offer
for the Assets.

                E. The Bidding Procedures are reasonable and appropriate and
represent the best method for maximizing the return for the Assets.

                NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:

                                  Sale Hearing

                1. The Sale Hearing shall be held before the undersigned United

Sale Motion and confirm the results of the Auction (as defined in the Motion),

the Debtors, the Buyer, and the Creditor Constituencies no later than 4:30
(prevailing Central Time) on [*] [seven days prior to the Sale Hearing] (the

                2. The failure of any objecting person or entity to timely file
its objection shall be a bar to the assertion, at the Sale Hearing or
thereafter, of any objection to the Sale Motion, the Sale, or the Debtors'
consummation and performance of the Agreement (including the transfer of the
Assets and Assumed Contracts free and clear of all Interests), if authorized by
the Court.

                3. The Sale Hearing may be adjourned from time to time without
further notice to creditors or parties in interest other than by announcement of
the adjournment in open court or on the Court's calendar on the date scheduled
for the Sale Hearing or any adjourned date.

                                    EXHIBIT A

                           NATIONAL STEEL CORPORATION

                               BIDDING PROCEDURES

                Set forth below are the bidding procedures (the "Bidding
Procedures") to be employed with respect to the asset purchase agreement (the
"Agreement") by and among National Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries
("National Steel" or "Sellers") and AK Steel Corporation (the "Proposed
Purchaser") concerning the prospective sale of the Acquired Assets (as that term
is defined in the Agreement). The Sellers will seek entry of an order from the
Bankruptcy Court authorizing and approving the Sale (as hereinafter defined) to
one or more Qualified Bidders (as hereinafter defined) which the Sellers, in
consultation with Mitsubishi Corporation ("Mitsubishi"), Marubeni Corporation
("Marubeni"), the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the "Creditors'
Committee") and the Unofficial Committee of Bondholders of the 9-7/8% Series D
Bonds due 2009 and 8-3/8% Series Bonds due 2006 (the "Bondholders Committee,"
and together with the Creditors' Committee, Mitsubishi and Marubeni, the
"Committees") may determine to have made the highest, best or otherwise
financially superior offer (the "Successful Bidder").

                                ASSETS TO BE SOLD

                The Sellers are offering for sale in one or more transactions
(the "Sale") all or substantially all of the assets of National Steel (the
"Assets"). The Proposed Purchaser has offered to purchase the Acquired Assets
which are described in the Agreement and which do not include all of the Assets.

                               THE BIDDING PROCESS

                The Sellers and their advisors, in consultation with the
Committees, shall (i) determine whether any person is a Qualified Bidder
(hereinafter defined), (ii) coordinate the efforts of Qualified Bidders in
conducting their due diligence investigations, (iii) receive offers from
Qualified Bidders, and (iv) negotiate any offers made to purchase the Assets
(collectively, the "Bidding Process"). Any person who wishes to participate in
the Bidding Process must be a Qualified Bidder. Neither the Sellers nor their
representatives shall be obligated to furnish any information of any kind
whatsoever to any person who is not determined to be a Qualified Bidder. The
Sellers, in consultation with the Committees, shall have the right to adopt such
other rules for the Bidding Process (including rules that may depart from those
set forth herein), which rules will better promote the goals of the

<PAGE>

Bidding Process and which are not inconsistent with any of the other provisions
hereof or of any Bankruptcy Court order.

                           PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS

                Unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court or determined
by the Sellers, in consultation with the Committees, each person (a "Potential
Bidder") interested in participating in the Bidding Process must deliver (unless
previously delivered) to the Sellers:

                (i)     An executed confidentiality agreement in substantially
                        similar form to that attached hereto as Annex A; and

                (ii)    Current audited financial statements of the Potential
                        Bidder, or, if the Potential Bidder is an entity formed
                        for the purpose of acquiring the Acquired Assets,
                        current audited financial statements of the equity
                        holder(s) of the Potential Bidder, or such other form of
                        financial disclosure acceptable to the Sellers and their
                        advisors, in consultation with the Committees,
                        demonstrating such Potential Bidder's ability to close a
                        proposed transaction.

                A Qualified Bidder is a Potential Bidder that delivers the
documents described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), and that the Sellers, in
consultation with the Committees, determine is reasonably likely (based on
financial information submitted by the Potential Bidder, the availability of
financing, experience and other considerations deemed relevant by the Sellers,
in consultation with the Committees) to submit a bona fide offer and to be able
to consummate the Sale if selected as a Successful Bidder.

                No later than two business days after a Potential Bidder
delivers all of the materials required by subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above, the
Sellers shall determine, and shall notify the Potential Bidder, if such
Potential Bidder is a Qualified Bidder. The Proposed Purchaser is hereby
determined to be a Qualified Bidder. In addition, each indenture trustee under
the 9-7/8% Series D Bonds due 2009 and 8-3/8% Series Bonds due 2006 are each
hereby deemed to be Qualified Bidders for the limited purposes of exercising any
rights that each may have under section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code.

<PAGE>

                                  DUE DILIGENCE

                The Sellers may afford any Qualified Bidder the time and
opportunity to conduct reasonable due diligence. The Sellers will designate an
employee or other representative to coordinate all reasonable requests for
additional information and due diligence access from such Qualified Bidders. The
Sellers shall not be obligated to furnish any due diligence information after
the Bid Deadline (as hereinafter defined). Neither the Sellers nor any of their
respective representatives are obligated to furnish any information to any
person other than a Qualified Bidder. The Sellers are not responsible for, and
will bear no liability with respect to, any information obtained by Bidders in
connection with the sale of the Assets.

                                LABOR CONTINGENCY

                No later than five (5) business days prior to the Auction (as
defined below), the Proposed Purchaser shall inform the Sellers, in writing, as
to whether the United States Steelworkers of America has executed and delivered
collective bargaining agreements relating to the represented employees of the
Business (as that term is described in the Agreement) in form and substance
satisfactory to the Proposed Purchaser, in its sole discretion.

                                  BID DEADLINE

                A Qualified Bidder who desires to make a bid shall deliver a
written copy of its bid to (1) Gary P. Cullen and Timothy R. Pohl, Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois), 333 West Wacker Drive, Suite 2100,
Chicago, IL 60606; and (2) Frank (Terry) A. Savage and Andrew T. Yearley, Lazard
Freres & Co., LLC ("Lazard"), 30 Rockefeller Center, 61st Floor, New York, NY
10020, not later than 12:00 p.m. (prevailing Central time) on the day that is
four (4) business days prior to the Auction (as defined below) (the "Bid
Deadline"). Lazard shall immediately distribute copies of the bids to counsel
for the Committees. The Sellers, after consultation with the Committees, shall
announce the terms of the highest, best or otherwise financially superior
Qualified Bid(s) received by the Bid Deadline no later than 5:00 p.m.
(prevailing Central time) on the second (2nd) business day after the Bid
Deadline.

                                BID REQUIREMENTS

                All bids must include the following documents (the "Required Bid
Documents"):

                  .   A letter stating that the bidder's offer is irrevocable
                      until the later of (x) 2 business days after the Acquired
                      Assets have been disposed of pursuant to these Bidding
                      Procedures, and (y) 30 days after the Sale Hearing.

                                       A-3

<PAGE>

                  .   An executed copy of a purchase agreement marked to show
                      modifications to the Agreement that the Qualified Bidder
                      proposes (the "Marked Agreement"), the overall value of
                      which must be equal to, or in excess of, at least
                      $2 million over the sum of the overall value of the
                      transactions contemplated by the Agreement and the Topping
                      Fee (the "Required Bid Value").

                  .   A good faith deposit (the "Good Faith Deposit") in the
                      form of a certified check (or other form acceptable to the
                      Sellers in their sole discretion) payable to the order of
                      the Sellers (or such other party as the Sellers may
                      determine) in an amount equal to $6.5 million.

                  .   Written evidence of a commitment for financing or other
                      evidence of the ability to consummate the Sale
                      satisfactory to the Sellers with appropriate contact
                      information for such financing sources.

                The Sellers, in consultation with the Committees, may choose to
disregard bids that are conditioned on obtaining financing or on the outcome of
unperformed due diligence by the bidder. A bid received from a Qualified Bidder
that includes all of the Required Bid Documents and meets all of the above
requirements is a "Qualified Bid."

                There is no requirement that a Qualified Bid include more or
less Assets than are covered by the Agreement. The Sellers, in consultation with
the Committees, reserve the right to determine (i) the value of any Qualified
Bid, (ii) whether any Qualified Bid (either by itself or in connection with
another Qualified Bid(s) provides overall value to Sellers that is equal to, or
in excess of, the Required Bid Value or any other Qualified Bid and (iii) which
Qualified Bid(s) constitutes the highest, best and otherwise financially
superior offer. The Sellers' determination in this regard may include an
analysis of the value (whether positive or negative) of any Assets that are
included in or excluded from any Qualified Bid, the existence or absence of any
escrow or indemnity and consideration of the Topping Fee, if applicable.

                                 BID PROTECTION

                Recognizing the Proposed Purchaser's expenditure of time, energy
and resources, the Sellers have agreed to provide certain bidding protections to
the

                                       A-4

<PAGE>

Proposed Purchaser. Specifically, the Sellers have determined that the Agreement
will further the goals of the Bidding Procedures by setting a floor for which
all other Potential Bids must exceed and, therefore, is entitled to be selected
as a "Stalking Horse Bid." As a result, the Sellers have agreed to pay, in
certain limited circumstances as set forth in the Agreement, a topping fee of
$15 million (the "Topping Fee") to the Proposed Purchaser. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Topping Fee shall not be payable or paid to the Proposed
Purchaser if the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii) of the
Agreement.

                                "AS IS, WHERE IS"

                The sale of the Assets shall be on an "as is, where is" basis
and without representations or warranties of any kind, nature, or description by
the Sellers, their agents or their estate except to the extent set forth in the
applicable agreement of the Successful Bidder as accepted by Sellers. Except as
otherwise provided in the applicable agreement, all of the Sellers' right, title
and interest in and to the Assets subject thereto shall be sold free and clear
of all pledges, liens, security interests, encumbrances, claims, charges,
options and interests thereon and there against (collectively, the "Interests")
in accordance with section 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, with such
Interests to attach to the net proceeds of the sale of the Assets.

                Each Qualified Bidder shall be deemed to acknowledge and
represent that it has had an opportunity to conduct any and all due diligence
regarding the Assets prior to making its offer, that it has relied solely upon
its own independent review, investigation and/or inspection of any documents
and/or the Assets in making its bid, and that it did not rely upon any written
or oral statements, representations, promises, warranties or guaranties
whatsoever, whether express, implied, by operation of law or otherwise,
regarding the Assets, or the completeness of any information provided in
connection therewith or the Auction, except as expressly stated in these Bidding
Procedures or, as to the Successful Bidder, the terms of the sale of the Assets
shall be set forth in the applicable agreement.

                                     AUCTION

                If one or more Qualified Bids (other than that of the Proposed
Purchaser) have been received, the Sellers shall conduct an auction (the
"Auction") with respect to the Assets. The Auction shall commence on the date
that is three (3) business days prior to the Sale Hearing (as defined below) at
the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois), 333 West Wacker
Drive, 19th Floor, Chicago, Illinois. The Sellers shall notify all Qualified
Bidders who have submitted Qualified Bids of the time and place of the Auction.
If there is no timely Qualified

                                       A-5

<PAGE>

Bid (other than that of the Proposed Purchaser), the Proposed Purchaser shall be
deemed to be the Successful Bidder.

                Only a Qualified Bidder who has submitted a Qualified Bid is
eligible to participate at the Auction. During the Auction, bidding shall begin
initially with the highest Qualified Bid and subsequently continue in minimum
increments of at least $1 million. Other than otherwise disclosed herein, the
Sellers, in consultation with the Committees, may conduct the Auction in the
manner they determine will result in the highest, best or otherwise financially
superior offer(s) for the Assets.

                Upon conclusion of the bidding, the Auction shall be closed, and
the Sellers, in consultation with the Committees, shall (i) immediately review
each Qualified Bid or Bids on the basis of financial and contractual terms and
the factors relevant to the sale process, including those factors affecting the
speed and certainty of consummating the Sale, and (ii) within one day identify
the highest, best or otherwise financially superior offer(s) for the Assets (the
"Successful Bid" and the entity or entities submitting such Successful Bid, the
"Successful Bidder"), which highest, best or otherwise financially superior
offer(s) will provide the greatest amount of net value to the Sellers after
payment of, among other things, the Topping Fee, if required and advise the
Bidders of such determination.

                          ACCEPTANCE OF QUALIFIED BIDS

                The Sellers shall sell the Assets to the Successful Bidder upon
the approval of the Successful Bid by the Bankruptcy Court after hearing (the
"Sale Hearing"). The Sellers' presentation of a particular Qualified Bid to the
Bankruptcy Court for approval does not constitute the Sellers' acceptance of the
bid. The Sellers will be deemed to have accepted a bid only when the bid has
been approved by the Bankruptcy Court at the Sale Hearing.

                                  SALE HEARING

                The Sale Hearing will be held before the Honorable
John H. Squires on March __, 2003 at ____ a.m. (prevailing Central time) at the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, located in
Chicago, Illinois, but may be adjourned or rescheduled without further notice by
an announcement of the adjourned date at the Sale Hearing.

                Following the Sale Hearing approving the sale of the Assets to
the Successful Bidder, if such Successful Bidder fails to consummate an approved
sale, the next highest or otherwise best Qualified Bid, as disclosed at the Sale
Hearing, shall be deemed to be the Successful Bid and the Sellers shall be
authorized, but not

                                       A-6

<PAGE>

required, to consummate the sale with the Qualified Bidder submitting such bid
without further order of the Bankruptcy Court.

                          RETURN OF GOOD FAITH DEPOSIT

                Good Faith Deposits of all Qualified Bidders (except for the
Successful Bidder) shall be held in an interest-bearing escrow account until the
Sale Hearing. If a Successful Bidder fails to consummate an approved sale
because of a breach or failure to perform on the part of such Successful Bidder,
the Sellers shall be entitled to retain the Good Faith Deposit as part of its
damages resulting from the breach or failure to perform by the Successful
Bidder.

                                  MODIFICATIONS

                The Sellers, in consultation with the Committees, may (a)
determine, which Qualified Bid, if any, is the highest, best or otherwise
financially superior offer; and (b) reject at any time before entry of an order
of the Bankruptcy Court approving a Qualified Bid, any bid that is (i)
inadequate or insufficient, (ii) not in conformity with the requirements of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Bidding Procedures, or the terms and conditions of sale, or
(iii) contrary to the best interests of the Sellers, their estates and
creditors. At or before the Sale Hearing, the Sellers, in consultation with the
Committees, may impose such other terms and conditions as the Sellers, in
consultation with the Committees, may determine to be in the best interests of
the Sellers' estate, their creditors and other parties in interest.

                           TRADEMARK LICENSE AGREEMENT

        This TRADEMARK LICENSE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is dated as of
____________ __, 2003 (the "Agreement Date") by and among AK Steel Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (together with any designated Subsidiaries, "Licensor"),
and National Steel Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Company").

        WHEREAS, Company and certain subsidiaries of Company each commenced a
case (collectively, the "Chapter 11 Case") on March 6, 2002 under chapter 11 of
title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. Sections 101 et seq. (the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the "Bankruptcy Court");

        WHEREAS, Company, certain of its subsidiaries and Licensor have entered
into that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 30, 2003 ("Asset
Purchase Agreement") whereby Company is selling to Licensor those assets of
Company's business (including the Marks (as defined below) and goodwill
associated therewith in which Company is assigning to Licensor all right title
and interest it may have) as specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement, all in
the manner and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Asset
Purchase Agreement and pursuant to, inter alia, Sections 363 and 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code;

        WHEREAS, Licensor has agreed to license to Company and its Affiliates
the Marks listed on Exhibit 2.2 for as long and as necessary for the wind down
of Company's own and its Affiliates' respective businesses; and

        WHEREAS, Company desires to obtain the right and license to use the
Marks listed on Exhibit 2.2 for as long and as necessary for the wind down of
Company's own and its Affiliates' respective businesses, all on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, covenants and
agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.      Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following capitalized
terms shall have the meanings set forth below. Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

        1.1     "Marks" means the marks set forth on Exhibit 2 and the goodwill
associated therewith.

2.      License.

        2.1     Company. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,
Licensor grants Company and its Affiliates a personal, nontransferable, license
to use the Marks listed on Exhibit 2.2 in a manner and to the extent consistent
with Company's current use of the Marks as of the Closing Date for as long and
as necessary for the wind down of Company's own and its Affiliates' respective
businesses.

        2.2     Assignment. Licensor agrees that if it decides to finally
abandon any Mark as listed on Exhibit 2.2, Licensor shall inform Company
reasonably in advance of such abandonment and shall first offer to assign any
such Marks to Company for US$1. It is expressly agreed that the obligations of
Licensor under this Section 2.2 are limited to the Marks listed in Exhibit 2.2
and that use of any such assigned Marks shall be limited to use in the wind down
of Company's own and its Affiliates' respective businesses. Company shall bear
all costs related to the assignment of any of the Marks from Licensor to

<PAGE>

Company hereunder, including all costs for the change of formal registrations,
if any. Licensor shall execute all documents and do all other acts as required
for the assignment of the Marks to Company under this Section 2.2.

3.      Ownership of the Marks.

        3.1     Company acknowledges that, as between Company and Licensor,
Licensor owns all right, title and interest in the Marks and the goodwill
associated therewith and any use of the Marks by Company and any goodwill
associated with such use shall inure to the benefit of Licensor for purposes of
trademark, service mark and trade name ownership, registration, maintenance and
enforcement.

4.      Quality Control.

        4.1     Company acknowledges that the Marks have established valuable
goodwill and are well-regarded by consumers as representing steel products and
services of the highest caliber, and that it is of great importance to Licensor
that this valuable goodwill and reputation be maintained. Company shall not use
the Marks or conduct its business in a manner which may detract from the
reputation and goodwill associated with the Licensor or the Marks.

        4.2     All products and services covered by the grant of license
hereunder shall conform to standards of quality at least comparable to those
generally prevailing on the Closing Date with respect to similar products sold
under the Marks by or on behalf of Licensor, consistent with Company's current
use of the Marks immediately before the Closing Date.

        4.3     Company shall supply to Licensor at such time as is reasonably
requested by Licensor representative samples of any products or services used in
connection with the Marks. In addition, upon reasonable request, Licensor may
inspect during regular business hours all facilities operated by Company to
verify proper use of the Marks as provided herein. If Licensor reasonably
determines that Company fails to meet any applicable quality standard, then
Licensor may request that Company take reasonable steps to remedy any such
deficiencies and Company shall comply with such requests.

        4.4     No inspection or approval by Licensor shall constitute any
express or implied representation or warranty by Licensor that any products are
in compliance with any laws, rules or regulations, or are otherwise free of
defects. Licensor reserves the right to investigate any alleged violation of any
law, rule, or regulation by Company and Company shall cooperate with Licensor in
any such investigation.

5.      Term and Termination. The license granted to Company under Section 2.1
in this Agreement shall remain in effect for as long and as necessary for the
wind down of Company's and its Affiliates' respective businesses, unless
terminated earlier as set forth in this Section 5. In the event of any breach of
any term of this Agreement by Company which remains uncured for a period of
thirty (30) days from written notice thereof, Licensor may (i) seek injunctive
relief against Company based on a breach of this Agreement by Company, (ii)
bring a legal action against Company seeking monetary damages, and/or, (iii)
based solely upon an uncured breach of Sections 2, 3 or 10.1 of this Agreement
by Company, may terminate this Agreement and any licenses granted thereunder.
Nothing in this Agreement limits or otherwise affects in any way the rights and
remedies of any party hereto with respect to causes of action arising under any
other agreement, any statute or common law right or on any other basis other
than breach of contract by any other party.

6.      Disclaimer of Warranties. THE MARKS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." LICENSOR MAKES
NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN RELATION TO THE MARKS OR THIS

                                        2

<PAGE>

AGREEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, LICENSOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND
ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NONINFRINGEMENT.

7.      Infringement Claims Brought by Third Parties.

        7.1     In the event that an action, claim or demand is brought against
Company by a third party alleging that the use of the Marks by Company infringes
on any trademarks, service marks or other intellectual property rights of any
third party ("Defensive Infringement Claim"), then Company shall promptly advise
Licensor in writing of such Defensive Infringement Claim. Licensor shall have
the right, at its option, to control the defense and settlement of the Defensive
Infringement Claim at Licensor's expense; provided that, any settlement thereof
shall be subject to the prior written consent of Company, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Company shall have the right to participate in the
defense of any such Defensive Infringement Claim through counsel of their own
choosing at their own expense. Company shall reasonably cooperate in the defense
of such claims, actions or demands at their expense. In the event that Licensor
declines to defend such Defensive Infringement Claim, then Company may defend
such Defensive Infringement Claim; provided any settlement related to such
Defensive infringement Claim shall be subject to the consent of Licensor, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Licensor may, at Licensor's own expense,
participate in such Defensive Infringement Claim with counsel of its own
selection.

        7.2     Any settlement amount or recovery for damages from a Defensive
Infringement Claim shall be applied as follows: (i) first, to the party
defending the Defensive Infringement Claim to reimburse such party for its
expenses in connection with the litigation; (ii) second, to the other party(ies)
to reimburse such party(ies) for its(their) expenses in connection with the
litigation; and (iii) finally, the party defending the Defensive Infringement
Claim shall receive any remaining settlement amount or recovery.

8.      Infringement Claims Against Third Parties.

        8.1     Licensor shall have the right to commence an action for
infringement of the Marks against any third party for any infringement occurring
anywhere in the world; provided that, before commencing any such action
regarding an infringement which Licensor reasonably believes would be likely to
adversely effect Company's use of the Marks as permitted in this Agreement
("Offensive Infringement Claim"), Licensor shall provide Company not less than
fifteen (15) days' prior notice of such Offensive Infringement Claim and of
Licensor's intent to file such action.

        8.2     In the event that Company is aware of a potential Offensive
Infringement Claim, Company, shall promptly notify Licensor in writing, which
writing shall set forth the details of such Offensive Infringement Claim.
Licensor shall have thirty (30) days to determine whether it will take action in
regards to an Offensive Infringement Claim. If Licensor declines or is deemed to
decline to prosecute such Offensive Infringement Claim by failure to respond by
the end of such thirty (30) day period, Company shall have the right, but not
the obligation, at its own expense to appear in such action by counsel of their
own selection; provided any settlement related to such Offensive Infringement
Claim shall be subject to the consent of Licensor, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and Licensor may, at Licensor's own expense, participate
in such Offensive Infringement Claim with counsel of its own selection. In the
event that Company does not bring a claim regarding such potential Offensive
Infringement Claim within sixty (60) days of Licensor's declination or deemed
declination of pursuing such claim, then the provisions of this Section 8.2
shall again apply.

                                        3

<PAGE>

        8.3     Any settlement amount or recovery for damages from an Offensive
Infringement Claim shall be applied as follows: (i) first, to the party
prosecuting the Offensive Infringement Claim to reimburse such party for its
expenses in connection with the litigation; (ii) second, to the other party(ies)
to reimburse such party(ies) for its(their) expenses in connection with the
litigation; and (iii) finally, the party prosecuting the Offensive Infringement
Claim shall receive any remaining settlement amount or recovery.

9.      Prosecution and Maintenance. Subject to the terms of Section 8, Licensor
may assume control over the prosecution or maintenance of any application or
registration for perfecting title and preserving rights of (collectively,
"Maintenance") each Mark in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
("PTO") or offices of foreign jurisdictions, including any costs of preparation,
prosecution, issuance and maintenance, and for perfecting title and preserving
rights of the Marks (collectively, "Maintenance Costs") in its name in the
applicable jurisdiction. Subject to the terms of Section 2.2, Licensor may
discontinue Maintenance or the paying of Maintenance Costs at any time for any
Mark in any jurisdiction. Licensor shall endeavor to provide notice to Company
of any decision to discontinue Maintenance of the Marks set forth in Exhibit
2.2. Licensor shall furnish to Company copies of any and all (i) applications,
renewals or other documents filed or presented to the PTO or other offices of
foreign jurisdictions relating to the Marks, and (ii) documents, correspondence
or other papers received from the PTO or other offices of foreign jurisdictions
pertaining to such Marks.

10.     Miscellaneous.

        10.1    Assignment. Company may assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to one or more of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Licensor may assign
its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or to a successor in interest pursuant a merger, reorganization, sale
of assets, joint venture or other transaction with any assignee or successor to
Licensor and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any business related to the
Marks licensed hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement, and the
licenses, restrictions and obligations set forth herein, shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns.

        10.2    Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of Licensor and Company, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. Without limiting
the foregoing, no direct or indirect holder of any equity interests or
securities of either Licensor (whether such holder is limited or general
partner, member, stockholder or otherwise), nor any Affiliate of Licensor, nor
any Representative or controlling Person of Licensor and its Affiliates, shall
have any liability or obligation arising under this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

                WHEREAS, Sellers and Buyer have entered into that certain Asset

transfer and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer has agreed to purchase, acquire and
accept from Sellers, the Acquired Assets;

                WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement;
and

                WHEREAS, the parties desire to carry out the intent and purpose
of the Asset Purchase Agreement by Sellers' execution and delivery to Buyer of
this instrument evidencing the vesting in Buyer of the Acquired Assets, subject
to the provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

                NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as follows:

                Section 1. As of the date hereof, Sellers hereby convey, grant,

delivery of this Bill of Sale and Assignment at the reasonable request of Buyer
and without further cost or expense to Buyer, unless otherwise provided in the
Asset Purchase Agreement, Sellers shall take such reasonable steps as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate so that Buyer shall be placed in actual
possession and operating control of the Acquired Assets.

                Section 3. Nothing in this instrument, express or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon, or give to, any Person other than
Buyer and its successors and assigns, any remedy or claim under or by reason of
this instrument or any terms, covenants or conditions hereof, and all the terms,

shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of Buyer and its successors and

exceed or enlarge or in any way affect the provisions, including the warranties,
covenants, agreements, conditions, or in general, any rights and remedies, and
any of the obligations of Sellers or Buyer set forth in the Asset Purchase
Agreement.

                Section 6. This Bill of Sale and Assignment shall be construed
and interpreted, and the rights of the parties shall be determined, in
accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any provision thereof that would require the application of the
substantive laws of any other jurisdiction, except to the extent that such laws
are superseded by the Bankruptcy Code.

                Section 7. Without limiting any party's right to appeal any
order of the Bankruptcy Court, (a) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive
jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Bill of Sale and Assignment and to
decide (insofar as they relate to Sellers) any claims or disputes which may
arise or result from, or be connected with, this Bill of Sale and Assignment,
any breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(b) any and all claims, actions, causes of action, suits and proceedings related
to the foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and
the parties hereby consent to and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the
Bankruptcy Court.

                Section 8. This Bill of Sale and Assignment may not be amended,
supplemented or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by each of
the parties hereto.

                Section 9. This Bill of Sale and Assignment may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Counterparts to
this Bill of Sale and Assignment may be delivered by facsimile. In proving this

more than one such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforcement is

FORTH IN THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT, (i) THE ACQUIRED ASSETS ARE BEING SOLD ON
AN "AS IS," "WHERE IS" BASIS AND (ii) NO SELLER MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES
INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRED

                FOUND AND DETERMINED THAT:/2/

                A. The Court has jurisdiction over this Motion and the

Procedures Order, (ii) such notice was good and sufficient, and appropriate
under the particular circumstances, and (iii) no other or further notice of the
Motion, the Sale Hearing, the Sale, or the assumption and assignment of the
Assumed Contracts is or shall be required.

                D. As demonstrated by (i) the testimony and other evidence
proffered or adduced at the Sale Hearing and (ii) the representations of counsel
made on the record at the Sale Hearing, the Debtors have marketed the Business
and conducted the sale process in compliance with the Sale Procedures Order and
the Auction was duly noticed and conducted in a non-collusive, fair and good
faith manner.

                E. Each Debtor (i) has full corporate power and authority to
execute the Agreement and all other documents contemplated thereby, and the sale
of the Business by the Debtors has been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action of each of the Debtors, (ii) has all of the corporate
power and authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement, (iii) has taken all corporate action necessary to authorize and
approve the Agreement and the consummation by such Debtors of the transactions
contemplated thereby, and (iv) no consents or approvals, other than those
expressly provided for in the Agreement, are required for the Debtors to
consummate such transactions.

                F. Approval of the Agreement and consummation of the Sale at
this time are in the best interests of the Debtors, their creditors, their
estates, and other parties in interest.

                G. The Debtors have demonstrated both (i) good, sufficient, and
sound business purpose and justification and (ii) compelling circumstances for
the Sale pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 363(b) prior to, and outside of, a plan
of reorganization in that, among other things, absent the Sale the value of the
Acquired Assets and the Business will be harmed.

                H. A reasonable opportunity to object or be heard with respect
to the Motion and the relief requested therein has been afforded to all
interested persons and entities, including: (i) the Office of the United States
Trustee; (ii) counsel for the Buyer; (iii) counsel for the Creditors' Committee;
(iv) counsel for the United Steelworkers of America; (v) counsel to the trustee
of the First Mortgage Bonds; (vi) counsel for Mitsubishi Corporation; (vii)
counsel to Marubeni Corporation; (viii) all entities known to have expressed an
interest in a transaction with respect to the Acquired Assets during the past
six months; (ix) all entities known to have asserted any Interests in or upon
the Acquired Assets; (x) all federal, state, and local regulatory or taxing
authorities or recording offices which have a reasonably known interest in the
relief requested by the Motion; (xi) all parties to Assumed Contracts; (xii) the
United States Attorney's office; (xiii) the Securities and Exchange Commission;
(xiv) the Internal Revenue Service; (xv) the Department of Justice; and (xvi)
all entities on the 2002 Service List.

                I. The Agreement was negotiated, proposed and entered into by
the Debtors and the Buyer without collusion, in good faith, and from
arm's-length bargaining positions. Neither the Debtors nor the Buyer have
engaged in any conduct that would cause or permit the Agreement to be avoided
under 11 U.S.C. Section 363(n).

                J. The Buyer is a good faith purchaser under 11 U.S.C. Section
363(m) and, as such, is entitled to all of the protections afforded thereby.

                K. The Buyer is not an "insider" of any of the Debtors, as that
term is defined in 11 U.S.C. Section 101.

                L. The consideration provided by the Buyer for the Business
pursuant to the Agreement (i) is fair and reasonable, (ii) is the highest or
otherwise best offer for the Business, (iii) will provide a greater recovery for
the Debtors' creditors than would be provided by any

                                        4

<PAGE>

other practical available alternative, and (iv) constitutes reasonably
equivalent value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and under the
laws of the United States, any state, territory, possession, or the District of
Columbia.

                M. The Sale must be approved and consummated promptly in order
to preserve the viability of the Debtors' Business as a going concern.

                N. The transfer of the Acquired Assets to the Buyer will be a
legal, valid, and effective transfer of the Acquired Assets, authorized pursuant
to the Bankruptcy Code, and will vest the Buyer with all right, title, and
interest of the Debtors to the Acquired Assets free and clear of all Interests
(as defined below), including, but not limited to those (A) that purport to give
to any party a right or option to effect any forfeiture, modification, right of
first refusal, or termination of the Debtors' or the Buyer's interest in the
Acquired Assets, or any similar rights, (B) relating to taxes arising under or
out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to the operation of the
Business prior to the Closing Date, and (C) (i) all mortgages, deeds of trust,
security interests, conditional sale or other title retention agreements,
pledges, liens, judgments, demands, encum-brances, rights of first refusal or
charges of any kind or nature, if any, including, but not limited to, any
restriction on the use, voting, transfer, receipt of income or other exercise of
any attributes of ownership and (ii) all debts arising in any way in connection
with any agreements, acts, or failures to act, of any of the Debtors or any of
the Debtors' predeces-sors or affiliates, claims (as that term is defined in the
Bankruptcy Code), obligations, liabilities, demands, guaranties, options,
rights, contractual or other commitments, restrictions, interests and matters of
any kind and nature, whether known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, whether
arising prior to or subsequent to the commencement of these bankruptcy cases,
and whether imposed by agreement, understanding, law, equity or otherwise,
including but

                                        5

<PAGE>

not limited to claims otherwise arising under doctrines of successor liability
to the extent permitted by law (collectively, "Interests").

                O. The Buyer would not have entered into the Agreement and would
not consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, thus adversely affecting
the Debtors, their estates, and their creditors, if the sale of the Acquired
Assets to the Buyer and the assignment of the Assumed Contracts and Assumed
Liabilities to the Buyer was not free and clear of all Interests or any kind or
nature whatsoever, or if the Buyer would, or in the future could, be liable for
any of the interests, including, without limitation, the Excluded Liabilities.

                P. Except as expressly set forth in the Agreement, the Buyer
shall have no liability for any liability, claim (as that term is defined in
section 101(5) of the Bank-ruptcy Code) or other obligation of or against the
Sellers related to the Acquired Assets by reason of the transfer of the Acquired
Assets to the Buyer. The Buyer shall not be deemed, as a result of any action
taken in connection with the purchase of the Acquired Assets, to: (1) be a
successor to the Sellers (other than with respect to the Assumed Liabilities and
any obligations arising under the Assumed Contracts (as such term is defined
below) from and after the Closing Date); or (2) have, de facto or otherwise,
merged with or into the Sellers. The Buyer is not acquiring or assuming any
liability, warranty or other obligation of the Sellers, except as set forth in
the Agreement or in any of the Assumed Contracts.

                Q. The Debtors may sell the Acquired Assets free and clear of
all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever because, in each case, one or
more of the standards set forth in 11 U.S.C. Section 363(f)(1)-(5) has been
satisfied. Those (i) holders of Interests and (ii) non-debtor parties to Assumed
Contracts who did not object, or who withdrew their objections, to the Sale or
the Motion are deemed to have consented pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 363(f)(2).
Those (i) holders

                                        6

<PAGE>

of Interests and (ii) non-debtor parties to Assumed Contracts who did object
fall within one or more of the other subsections of 11 U.S.C. Section 363(f) and
are adequately protected by having their Interests, if any, attach to the cash
proceeds of the Sale ultimately attributable to the property against or in which
they claim an Interest.

                R. The sale of the Business to the Buyer is a prerequisite to
the Debtors' ability to confirm and consummate a plan or plans of
reorganization. The Sale is a sale in contemplation of a plan and, accordingly,
a transfer pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 1146(c), which shall not be taxed under
any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.

                S. The Debtors have demonstrated that it is an exercise of their
sound business judgment to assume and assign the Assumed Contracts to the Buyer
in connection with the consummation of the Sale, and the assumption and
assignment of the Assumed Contracts is in the best interests of the Debtors,
their estates, and their creditors. The Assumed Contracts being assigned to, and
the liabilities being assumed by, the Buyer are an integral part of Business
being purchased by the Buyer and, accordingly, such assumption and assignment of
Assumed Contracts and liabilities are reasonable, enhance the value of the
Debtors' estates, and do not constitute unfair discrimination.

                T. The Debtors have (i) cured, or have provided adequate
assurance of cure, of any default existing prior to the date hereof under any of
the Assumed Contracts, within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. Section 365(b)(1)(A) and
(ii) provided compensation or adequate assurance of compensation to any party
for any actual pecuniary loss to such party resulting from a default prior to
the date hereof under any of the Assumed Contracts, within the meaning of 11
U.S.C. Section 365(b)(1)(B), and the Buyer has provided adequate assurance of
their future performance of and under the Assumed Contracts, within the meaning
of 11 U.S.C. Section 365(b)(1)(C).

                                        7

<PAGE>

                U. Those non-debtor parties to Assumed Contracts who did not
object to the assumption and assignment of their Assumed Contract are deemed to
have consented to the assumption and assignment of their Assumed Contract to the
Buyer.

                V. Approval of the Agreement and assumption and assignment of
the Assumed Contracts and consummation of the Sale of the Acquired Assets at
this time are in the best interests of the Debtors, their creditors, their
estates and other parties in interest.

                NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED THAT,

                               General Provisions

authorized to perform their obligations under and comply with the terms of the
Agreement, and consummate the Sale, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Agreement.

                5. The Debtors are authorized and directed to execute and
deliver, and empowered to perform under, consummate and implement, the
Agreement, together with all additional instruments and documents that may be
reasonably necessary or desirable to implement the Agreement, including but not
limited to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, Deposit Escrow Agreement,

Agreement, and Transition Services Agreement and to take all further actions as
may be requested by the Buyer for the purpose of assigning, transferring,
granting, conveying and conferring to the Buyer or reducing to possession, the
Acquired Assets, or as may be necessary or appropriate to the performance of the
obligations as contemplated by the Agreement, including the payment by Debtors
to Buyer of the Working Capital Adjustment, if any, on the Working Capital
Payment Date, which obligation shall be an allowed administrative claim pursuant
to 11 U.S.C. Sections 503(b) and 507(a)(1), and be payable by the Debtors in
accordance with the Agreement without further order.

                6. This Order and the Agreement shall be binding in all respects
upon all creditors (whether known or unknown) of any Debtor, all non-debtor
parties to the Assumed Contracts, all successors and assigns of the Buyer, the
Debtors and their affiliates and subsidiaries, the Business, and any subsequent
trustees appointed in the Debtors' chapter 11 cases or upon a conversion to
chapter 7 under the Bankruptcy Code and shall not be subject to rejection.
Nothing contained in any chapter 11 plan confirmed in these bankruptcy cases or
the confirmation order confirming any such chapter 11 plan shall conflict with
or derogate from the provisions of the Agreement or this Order.

                7. The Agreement and any related agreements, documents, or other
instruments may be modified, amended or supplemented by the parties thereto in
accordance with the terms thereof without further order of the Court; provided
that any such modification, amendment, or supplement is not material.

                               Transfer of Assets

                8. Except as expressly permitted or otherwise specifically
provided for in the Agreement or this Order, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sections
105(a) and 363(f), the Acquired Assets shall be transferred to the Buyer, and
upon consummation of the Agreement (the "Closing") shall be, free and clear of
all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever with all such Interests of any
kind or nature whatsoever to attach to the net proceeds of the Sale in the order
of their priority, with the same validity, force and effect which they now have
as against the Acquired Assets, subject to any claims and defenses the Debtors
may possess with respect thereto.

                9. Except as expressly permitted or otherwise specifically
provided by the Agreement or this Order, all persons and entities, including,
but not limited to, all debt security holders, equity security holders,
governmental, tax, and regulatory authorities, lenders, trade and other
creditors, holding Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever against or in the
Debtors or the Acquired Assets (whether legal or equitable, secured or
unsecured, matured or unmatured, contingent or non-contingent, senior or
subordinated), arising under or out of, in connection with, or in any way
relating to, the Debtors, the Acquired Assets, the operation of the Business
prior to the Closing Date, or the transfer of the Acquired Assets to the Buyer,
hereby are forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from asserting
against the Buyer, its successors or assigns, its property, or the Acquired
Assets, such persons' or entities' Interests.

                10. Nothing in the Order or the Agreement releases or nullifies
any liability to a governmental entity under police or regulatory statutes or
regulations that any entity would be subject to as the owner or operator of
property after the date of entry of this Order.

                11. The transfer of the Acquired Assets to the Buyer pursuant to
the Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and effective transfer of the Acquired
Assets, and shall vest the Buyer

                                       10

<PAGE>

with all right, title, and interest of the Debtors in and to the Acquired Assets
free and clear of all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever.

                12. If any person or entity that has filed financing statements,
mortgages, mechanic's liens, lis pendens, or other documents or agreements
evidencing Interests in the Debtors or the Acquired Assets shall not have
delivered to the Debtors prior to the Closing Date, in proper form for filing
and executed by the appropriate parties, termination statements, instruments of
satisfaction, releases of all Interests which the person or entity has with
respect to the Debtors or the Acquired Assets or otherwise, then (a) the Debtors
are hereby authorized and directed to execute and file such statements,
instruments, releases and other documents on behalf of the person or entity with
respect to the Acquired Assets and (b) the Buyer is hereby authorized to file,
register, or otherwise record a certified copy of this Order, which, once filed,
registered or otherwise recorded, shall constitute conclusive evidence of the
release of all Interests in the Acquired Assets of any kind or nature
whatsoever.

                            Assumption and Assignment
                          to Buyer of Assumed Contracts

                13. Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Sections 105(a) and 365, and subject
to and conditioned upon the Closing of the Sale, the Debtors' assumption and
assignment to the Buyer, and the Buyer's assumption on the terms set forth in
the Agreement, of the Assumed Contracts is hereby approved, and the requirements
of 11 U.S.C. Section 365(b)(1) with respect thereto are hereby deemed satisfied.

                14. The Debtors are hereby authorized and directed in accordance
with 11 U.S.C. Sections 105(a) and 365 to (a) assume and assign to the Buyer,
effective upon the Closing of the Sale, the Assumed Contracts free and clear of
all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever and (b)

<PAGE>

execute and deliver to the Buyer such documents or other instruments as may be
necessary to assign and transfer the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Liabilities
to the Buyer.

                15. With respect to the Assumed Contracts: (a) the Assumed
Contracts shall be transferred and assigned to, and following the closing of the
Sale remain in full force and effect for the benefit of, the Buyer in accordance
with their respective terms, notwithstanding any provision in any such Assumed
Contract (including those of the type described in sections 365(b)(2) and (f) of
the Bankruptcy Code) that prohibits, restricts, or conditions such assignment or
transfer and, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 365(k), the Debtors shall be
relieved from any further liability with respect to the Assumed Contracts after
such assignment to and assumption by the Buyer; (b) each Assumed Contract is an
executory contract of the Debtors under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code; (c)
the Debtors may assume each Assumed Contract in accordance with Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code; (d) the Debtors may assign each Assumed Contract in
accordance with Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and any provisions
in any Assumed Contract that prohibit or condition the assignment of such
Assumed Contract or allow the party to such Assumed Contract to terminate,
recapture, impose any penalty, condition renewal or extension, or modify any
term or condition upon the assignment of such Assumed Contract, constitute
unenforceable anti-assignment provisions which are void and of no force and
effect; (e) all other requirements and conditions under Section 363 and 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code for the assumption by the Seller and assignment to the Buyer
of each Assumed Contract have been satisfied; (f) upon Closing, in accordance
with Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Buyer shall be fully and
irrevocably vested in all right, title and interest of each contract; and (g)
each non-Debtor party to an Assumed Contract that has not objected to the
assumption and assignment of such Assumed Contract to Buyer is deemed to have
consented to

                                       12

<PAGE>

the assumption and assignment of such Assumed Contract to Buyer and is forever
barred from arguing otherwise.

                16. All defaults or other obligations of the Debtors under any
Assumed Contract arising or accruing prior to the Closing Date (without giving
effect to any acceleration clauses or any default provisions of the kind
specified in section 365(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code) shall be cured by the
Debtors by the payment of the Cure Amount associated with such Assumed Contract
at the Closing of the Sale or as soon thereafter as practicable, and the Buyer
shall have no liability or obligation arising or accruing prior to the date of
the Closing of the Sale, except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Agreement.

                17. Each non-Debtor party to an Assumed Contract hereby is
forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from asserting against the
Debtors or the Buyer, or the property of either of them, any default existing as
of the Closing Date of the Sale.

                18. Except as provided in the Agreement or this Order, after the
Closing, the Debtors and their estates shall have no further liabilities or
obligations with respect to any assumed liabilities and all holders of such
claims are forever barred and estopped from asserting such claims against the
Debtors, their successors or assigns, their property or their assets or estates.

                              Additional Provisions

                19. The consideration provided by the Buyer for the Business

                21. On the Closing Date of the Sale, each of the Debtors'
creditors is authorized and directed to execute such documents and take all
other actions as may be necessary to release its Interests in the Acquired
Assets, if any, as such Interests may have been recorded or may otherwise exist.

                22. This Order (a) shall be effective as a determination that,
on the Closing Date, all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever existing as
to the Debtors or the Acquired Assets prior to the Closing have been
unconditionally released, discharged and terminated (other than the Surviving
Obligations), and that the conveyances described herein have been effected and
(b) shall be binding upon and shall govern the acts of all entities including
without limitation, all filing agents, filing officers, title agents, title
companies, recorders of mortgages, recorders of deeds, registrars of deeds,
administrative agencies, governmental departments, secretaries of state,
federal, state, and local officials, and all other persons and entities who may
be required by operation of law, the duties of their office, or contract, to
accept, file, register or otherwise record or release any documents or
instruments, or who may be required to report or insure any title or state of
title in or to any of the Acquired Assets.

                23. Each and every federal, state, and local governmental agency
or department is hereby directed to accept any and all documents and instruments
necessary and appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement.

                24. All entities who are presently, or on the Closing Date may
be, in possession of some or all of the Acquired Assets are hereby directed to
surrender possession of the Acquired Assets to the Buyer on the Closing Date.

                25. This Court retains jurisdiction to enforce and implement the
terms and provisions of the Agreement, all amendments thereto, any waivers and
consents thereunder, and of each of

                                       14

<PAGE>

the agreements executed in connection therewith in all respects, including, but
not limited to, retaining jurisdiction to (a) compel delivery of the Acquired
Assets to the Buyer, (b) compel delivery of the purchase price or performance of
other obligations owed to the Debtors, (c) resolve any disputes arising under or
related to the Agreement, and (d) interpret, implement, and enforce the
provisions of this Order.

                26. The transactions contemplated by the Agreement are
undertaken by the Buyer in good faith, as that term is used in section 363(m) of
the Bankruptcy Code, and accordingly, the reversal or modification on appeal of
the authorization provided herein to consummate the Sale shall not affect the
validity of the Sale to the Buyer (including the assumption and assignment of
any of the Assumed Contracts), unless such authorization is duly stayed pending
such appeal. The Buyer is a Buyer in good faith of the Acquired Assets, and is
entitled to all of the protections afforded by section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy
Code.

                27. The terms and provisions of the Agreement and this Order
shall be binding in all respects upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the
Debtors, their estates, and their creditors, the Buyer, and its respective
affiliates, successors and assigns, and any affected third parties including,
but not limited to, all persons asserting an Interest in the Acquired Assets to
be sold to the Buyer pursuant to the Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent
appointment of any trustee(s) under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, as to
which trustee(s) such terms and provisions likewise shall be binding.

                28. The failure specifically to include any particular
provisions of the Agreement in this Order shall not diminish or impair the
effectiveness of such provision, it being the intent of the Court that the
Agreement be authorized and approved in its entirety.

                29. The Agreement and any related agreements, documents or other
instruments may be modified, amended or supplemented by the parties thereto, in
a writing signed by both parties, and in accordance with the terms thereof,
without further order of the Court, provided that any such modification,
amendment or supplement does not have a material adverse effect on the Debtors'
estates. In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Order
and the Agreement, the terms of the Agreement shall control.

                30. The transfer of the Acquired Assets pursuant to the Sale is
a transfer pursuant to section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, and accordingly
shall not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or a sale, transfer, or
any other similar tax. Each and every federal, state and local government agency
or department is hereby directed to accept any and all documents and instruments
necessary and appropriate to consummate the transfer of any of the Acquired
Assets, all without imposition or payment of any stamp tax, transfer tax, or
similar tax.

                32. As provided by Rules 6004(g) and 6006(d) of the Federal
