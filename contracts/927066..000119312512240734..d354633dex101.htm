(iv) _Escrow Payment_. A non-transferable, contingent right to

without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of Stock-Based Awards, each Stock-Based Award, if any, that was
granted in accordance with _Section 6.18(a)_ will be assumed by Parent and
will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of
such award immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting
restrictions, except that (x) each Stock-Based Award will be exercisable for a
number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Common Units
subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, (y) if applicable, the per unit base or exercise price
for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Stock-Based
Award will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per unit base
or exercise price for such Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent,
and (z) all references to the "Company" in the Company Plan and the award
agreements will be references to Parent.

 



31 (ii) _Company Options_. Parent shall not assume or otherwise replace any
Company Options in connection with the Transactions. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each Company Option
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall accelerate
and become fully vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and, to the extent unexercised, shall be cancelled,
extinguished, and automatically converted into the right to receive, for each

(G). The payment of the Per Option Closing Consideration and, if and when due,
the Final Per Unit Adjustment Payment, the Per Unit Earn-Out Payment, the
Escrow Payment, the MR Escrow Payment, and the Nevada Escrow Payment with
respect to the Company Options shall be reduced by any applicable income or
employment Tax withholding required under the Code or any provision of
applicable state, local, or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be timely paid to the applicable
taxing authority and treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of such Company Options. As applicable, payment of the Per
Unit Earn-Out Payment shall be made prior to the date that is five (5) years
following the Effective Time and otherwise in accordance with Section
1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A) of the Treasury Regulations or any successor thereto.

 

(iii) If determined by Parent in its sole discretion, following the Effective
Time, in accordance with the NYSE listing standards, Parent will be able to
grant stock-based awards under the terms of its 2011 Incentive Award Plan or
another stock plan adopted by Parent to issue the reserved but unissued
Company Common Units otherwise issuable under the Company Plan, except that
(i) the equity interests covered by such awards will be shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) the number of Company Common Units available for
issuance shall be converted into a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of Company Common Units otherwise
available for issuance under the Company Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time (after taking into consideration the number of Company Common
Units 

 



32  that will return to the Company Plan in connection with the cancellation of
the Company Options contemplated by this Section) multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (the " _Available Reserve_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Available Reserve shall in no event exceed 1,500,000 shares of Parent Common
Stock. In accordance with the NYSE listing standards, the time during which
such shares of Parent Common Stock are available will not be extended beyond
the period when they would have otherwise been available under the Company
Plan, absent the Merger, and no stock-based awards will be granted by Parent
to individuals who were employed, immediately before the transaction, by
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in existence immediately prior to the
Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in
any event within ten (10) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the assumed
Stock-Based Awards, if any, and the Available Reserve, if any, and Parent
shall cause the same to become effective.

(iv) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph (iii), if Parent obtains a
recommendation by Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory
subsidiary of MSCI Inc. (" _ISS_ "), of a vote "for" the amendment to its 2011
Incentive Award Plan described in Parents Proxy Statement for its 2012
Annual Stockholder Meeting, Parent shall not assume the Available Reserve or
otherwise be able to grant any stock-based awards as of or following the
Effective Time or cause the Company under the terms hereof to grant any stock-
based awards prior to or as of the Effective Time, in each case attributable
to the reserved but unissued Company Common Units otherwise issuable under the
Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(v) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all action
necessary or reasonably requested by Parent to effect the assumption of the
Stock-Based Awards and the cancellation and cash-out of the Company Options
and in furtherance of preserving and assuming the Available Reserve, including
adopting all resolutions, giving all notices, obtaining any written consents,
and taking any other actions that are necessary or appropriate to effectuate
this _Section 3.01(b)_. Any notices, consents, or other communications to
holders of Stock-Based Awards or Company Options will be subject to the
review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed. No awards shall be granted pursuant to the Company
Plan following the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Estimated Amounts Included In Closing Merger Consideration_. No later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
prepare and deliver to Parent (i) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of
the Business Entities and Related Consolidated Entities as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and
(ii) a statement derived from such estimated consolidated balance sheet (the "
_Estimated Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth the Companys good faith
estimates of the Net Working Capital of the Business Entities and Related
Consolidated Entities (such estimates, the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_
") and the Indebtedness Amount (the " _Estimated Indebtedness Amount_ "), in
each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Adjustment Statement shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with _Exhibit B_ and in accordance with GAAP, applied
on a basis consistent with the Audited 

 



33  Financial Statements, and include reasonable detail with respect to the
calculation of each component of the Estimated Net Working Capital and the
Estimated Indebtedness Amount; _provided_  that Estimated Net Working Capital
and Estimated Indebtedness Amount shall be calculated in accordance with the
definitions of those terms herein. The Company and Parent shall use good faith
efforts to resolve prior to the Closing any disagreements between them
concerning the computation of any of the items on the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet or the Estimated Adjustment Statement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
if the parties are unable to resolve any such disagreement, any item
in dispute shall be deemed (solely for purposes of determining the Closing
Merger Consideration, but subject in all respects to adjustment pursuant to
_Section 3.05_) equal to the sum of (x) the estimate prepared in good faith
by the Company and (y) Parents good faith estimate of such item, divided by
two. If the Estimated Net Working Capital minus the Estimated Indebtedness
Amount is less than the Target (such deficiency stated as a positive number,
the " _Estimated Shortfall Amount_ "), then the Closing Merger Consideration
shall be decreased by an amount equal to the Estimated Shortfall Amount and
the Per Unit Closing Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to
the Estimated Shortfall Amount divided by the Total Outstanding Company
Units.

(d) _Dissenting Units_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Company Common Units that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by Members properly exercising
dissenters rights available under the Dissenters Act (the " _Dissenting
Units_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive payment from the
Surviving Entity with respect thereto and shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive cash or shares of Parent Common Stock
unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the Dissenters
Act. Dissenting Units shall be treated in accordance with the
Dissenters Act. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders
Company Common Units shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable
only for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, cash or shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE III_. The
Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Company Common Units, any attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the Dissenters Act and
received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of
Dissenting Units, as provided in the Dissenters Act; and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in, and, after the Closing, direct, all
negotiations and Actions with respect to demands for appraisal under the
Dissenters Act. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal of Company Common Units. The Company or the Surviving
Entity, as applicable under the Dissenters Act, shall comply with all notice
requirements under the Dissenters Act.

(e) _Rights as Unitholders; Unit Transfers_. From and after the Effective
Time, Company Common Units shall be no longer outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and Members will have no
rights as unitholders of the Company, other than rights to receive (without
interest) (i) any then-unpaid dividend or other distribution with respect to
such Company Common Units having a record date before the Effective Time and
(ii) the consideration to which such holders are entitled in accordance with
this _ARTICLE III_ (or as to Dissenting Units, such rights as provided by the
CLLCA). After the Effective Time, there will be

 



34  no transfers of Company Common Units on the unit transfer books of the
Company or the Surviving Entity, and Company Common Units presented to Parent
or the Surviving Entity for any reason will be canceled and exchanged in
accordance with this _ARTICLE III_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
3.01_ to the contrary, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each
Company Common Unit beneficially owned by the Company (other than units held
in a trust, fiduciary, or nominee capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted) or held in the Companys treasury will be canceled and retired and
will cease to exist, and no shares of Parent Common Stock or any other
consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor.

(f) _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. If Parent changes (or the Parent Board sets
a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a change
in) the number or kind of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding by way of
a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification,
reorganization, or similar transaction, then the Aggregate Parent Share
Number, the Closing Price, and the Exchange Ratio (and any other dependent
items) will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change. If the
Company changes (or the Company Board sets a related record date that will
occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of Company
Common Units (or rights thereto) outstanding by way of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization, or similar
transaction, then the aggregate per unit exercise price of all Company Options
(and any other dependent items) will be adjusted proportionately to account
for such change.

 

(g) _Merger Sub Units_. Each unit of membership interest in Merger Sub (a "
_Merger Sub Unit_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into one common unit of the Surviving Entity.

(h) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. Instead, Parent will pay to each holder of Company Common Units who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock an
amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock by the Closing Price.

 

Section 3.02. _Escrowed Merger Consideration_.

(a) A portion of the Closing Merger Consideration equal to the Escrow Amount
shall constitute escrowed merger consideration (collectively with any earnings
or dividends or other distributions thereon, if any, the " _Escrowed Merger
Consideration_ "). The Escrowed Merger Consideration shall be withheld from
the Closing Merger Consideration otherwise deliverable to the Members and
holders of Company Options on the Closing Date to serve as security for the
benefit of Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Parent Indemnified Party)
against (x) the indemnification afforded the Parent Indemnified Parties by
_ARTICLE VIII_ of this Agreement and (y) any reduction in the Aggregate Final
Per Unit Merger Consideration or the Aggregate Final Per Option Merger
Consideration made pursuant to _Section 3.05(f)_. The Escrowed Merger
Consideration shall consist of cash and Parent Common Stock in the
Escrow Proportion, with each share of Parent Common Stock valued for these
purposes at the One Day Parent Stock Volume-Weighted Average Price as of the
Closing Date. On the Closing Date, the

 



35  Escrowed Merger Consideration shall be deposited by Parent with the Escrow
Agent in an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") established in
accordance with an escrow agreement to be entered into among Parent, the
Member Representative, and the Escrow Agent, consistent with the terms set
forth in this Agreement and other customary terms and conditions for similar
agreements (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Agreement shall provide
that Parent is, for federal income tax purposes, the owner of the Escrowed
Merger Consideration and is taxable on any earnings thereon. If any payment is
required to be made to Parent pursuant to this  _Section 3.02_, Parent and
the Member Representative shall promptly provide written instructions to the
Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to deliver to
Parent out of the Escrow Fund an amount of cash and Parent Common Stock, in
the Escrow Proportion (to the extent possible and so as not to create
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock), that in the aggregate is equal in
value to such required payment, with each share of Parent Common Stock valued
for these purposes at the One Day Parent Stock Volume-Weighted Average Price
as of the date of such distribution.

(b) On the Survival End Date (the " _First Escrow Distribution Date_ "), the

Section 3.03. _Election Procedures_.

(a) _Election Form_. An election form and other appropriate and customary
transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery to the
Exchange Agent), in such form as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree
(the " _Election Form_ "), shall be mailed on a date that is not less than
thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Effective Time (such date, the "
_Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of Company Common Units as of five
(5) Business Days prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_
"). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make
available as many Election Forms as may be reasonably requested by all
persons who are holders (or beneficial owners) of Company Common Units on the
Election Form Record Date or who become holders (or beneficial owners) of
Company Common Units after the Election Form Record Date and prior to the
close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Election
Deadline. The Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

 

(b) _Choice of Election_. Each Election Form shall permit such holder, subject
to the allocation and election procedures set forth in this _Section 3.03_,
(i) to elect to receive an amount of cash equal to the Per Unit Closing
Consideration for all of the Company Common Units held by such holder (a "
_Cash Election_ "), (ii) to elect to receive the Per Unit Closing Stock
Consideration for all of such units (a " _Stock Election_ "), (iii) to elect
to receive the Per Unit Closing Stock Consideration for a certain number of
such holders units and an amount of cash equal to the Per Unit Closing
Consideration for all other units of such holders units (a " _Mixed Election_
"), or (iv) to indicate that such record holder has no preference as to the
receipt of cash or Parent Common Stock for such units. A holder of record of
Company Common Units who holds such units as nominee, trustee, or in another
representative capacity (a " _Unitholder Representative_ ") (which shall
include, for the avoidance of doubt, the Majority Member and Bay Shores
Investment LLC) may submit multiple Election Forms; _provided_ that each such
Election Form covers all the Company Common Units held by such Unitholder
Representative for a particular beneficial owner;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Unitholder Representative shall permit the

 



40  holders of its equity securities to direct it to make an election in
accordance with the terms of its governing documents and the Unitholder
Representative shall make an election that reflects such election by the
holders of its equity securities. Company Common Units as to which a Cash
Election (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) has been made are referred
to herein as " _Cash Election Units_." Company Common Units as to which a
Stock Election has been made (including, pursuant to a Mixed Election) are
referred to as " _Stock Election Units_." Company Common Units as to which no
election has been made (or as to which an Election Form is not
returned properly completed) are referred to herein as " _Non-Election
Units_."

(c) _Non-Election; Dissenting Units_. Any Company Common Units with respect
to which the holder thereof shall not, as of the Election Deadline, have made
an election by submission to the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly
completed Election Form shall be deemed Non-Election Units. All Dissenting
Units shall be deemed units subject to a Cash Election, and with respect to
such units the holders thereof shall in no event receive consideration
comprised of Parent Common Stock, except as provided in Section _ 3.03(h)_
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of making the proration
calculations provided for in this _Section 3.03_, only Dissenting Units as
existing at the Effective Time shall be deemed Cash Election Units.

(d) _Effectiveness; Election Deadline_. To be effective, a properly completed
Election Form shall be submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the
Effective Time (or such other time and date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ "). An election shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form
shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by duly executed
transmittal materials included with the Election Form. Any Election Form may
be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form to the
Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice of
revocation or change is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to
the Election Deadline. If a Member either (i) does not submit a properly
completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes its Election
Form prior to the Election Deadline (without later submitting a properly
completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline), the Company Common
Units held by such Member shall be designated as Non-Election Units. Subject
to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent
shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,
modification, or revocation has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the
Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of
Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to
notify any person of any defect in an Election Form. All Elections (whether
Cash Elections, Stock Elections, or Mixed Elections) shall be revoked
automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent or the
Company, upon exercise by Parent or the Company of its respective or their
mutual rights to terminate this Agreement to the extent provided under
_ARTICLE IX_ , that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
_ARTICLE IX_.

(e) _Maximum Stock Election_. If a Member makes a Stock Election for a number
of Company Common Units in excess of such Members Maximum Stock Election
Eligible Units, then such Member shall be deemed to have made a Stock
Election with respect to

 



41  a number of Company Common Units equal to such Members Maximum Stock
Election Eligible Units and a Cash Election with respect to all other of such
Members Company Common Units. 

(f) _Stock Elections Equal to Unit Conversion Number_. Notwithstanding any
other provision contained in this Agreement, the total number of Company
Common Units to be converted into the right to receive the Per Unit Closing
Stock Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)(i)_ (the " _Unit Conversion
Number_ ") shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
Aggregate Parent Share Number by (y) the Exchange Ratio. Each other Company
Common Unit (other than Dissenting Units) shall be converted into an amount of
cash equal to the Per Unit Closing Consideration. 

(g) _Stock Consideration Proration_. If the aggregate number of Company Common
Units with respect to which Stock Elections shall have been validly made (the
" _Stock Election Number_ ") exceeds the Unit Conversion Number, then all Cash
Election Units and all Non-Election Units of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the Per Unit
Closing Consideration, and Stock Election Units of each holder thereof will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Unit Closing Stock Consideration
in respect of that number of Stock Election Units equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Units held by such
holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Unit Conversion Number
and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, with each of such
holders remaining Stock Election Units being converted into the right to
receive an amount of cash equal to the Per Unit Closing Consideration.

(h) _Cash Consideration Proration_. If the Stock Election Number is less than
the Unit Conversion Number (the amount by which the Unit Conversion Number
exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the "
_Shortfall Number_ "), then all Stock Election Units shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Unit Closing Stock Consideration, and the Non-
Election Units and Cash Election Units shall be treated in the following
manner:

(i) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Units, then all Cash Election Units shall be converted into the
right to receive an amount of cash equal to the Per Unit Closing
Consideration, and the Non-Election Units of each holder thereof shall convert
into the right to receive the Per Unit Closing Stock Consideration in respect
of that number of Non-Election Units equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of Non-Election Units held by such holder by (B) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator
of which is the total number of Non-Election Units, with each of such holders
remaining Non-Election Units being converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash equal to the Per Unit Closing Consideration; or 

(ii) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Units, then
all Non-Election Units shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Unit Closing Stock Consideration, and the Cash Election Units of each holder
thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Unit Closing
Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Units equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the

 



42  number of Cash Election Units held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount by which (x) the Shortfall Number exceeds (y)
the total number of Non-Election Units and the denominator of which is the
total number of Cash Election Units, with each of such holders remaining Cash
Election Units being converted into the right to receive an amount of cash
equal to the Per Unit Closing Consideration.

(iii) Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) above, if as a result of the
application of clause (i) or (ii) above, any Member shall be making a Stock
Election for a number of Company Common Units in excess of such Members
Maximum Stock Election Eligible Units, then such Member shall instead be
deemed to have made a Stock Election with respect to a number of Company
Common Units equal to such Members Maximum Stock Election Eligible Units and
a Cash Election with respect to all other of such Members Company Common
Units, and the resulting Shortfall Number shall be reallocated to the other
Members Non-Election Units and Cash Election Units in the manner set forth in
clause (i) and (ii) above, with references to "Non-Election Units" and "Cash
Election Units" in such clauses (i) and (ii) being deemed for purposes of
this reallocation to exclude Non-Election Units and Cash Election Units held
by any Member that has made, or has been deemed to have made, a Stock Election
equal to such Members Maximum Stock Election Eligible Units.

Section 3.04. _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. After the Election Deadline and no later
than the Closing Date and until the date that is one hundred eighty (180)
days after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with an exchange agent agreed upon by Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") (i) cash in an amount sufficient to allow the Exchange Agent to
make all payments that may be required pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ ;
_provided_ that (1) pursuant to _Section 3.02_ the Escrow Amount consisting
of cash shall be delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent to be held pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement, (2) pursuant to _Section 3.07_ the MR Escrow Amount
shall be delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent to be held pursuant to the MR

shall be delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent to be held pursuant to the
Nevada Escrow Agreement, and (4) the aggregate amount of cash payable in
respect of all Company Options pursuant to  _Section 3.01(b)(ii)(A)_ shall
be delivered by Parent to the Company for proper payment to the holders of
Company Options, and (ii) certificates, or at Parents option, evidence of
shares in book entry form, representing the Aggregate Parent Share Number of

holders of Company Common Units in exchange for their units pursuant to this
_ARTICLE III_ ; _provided_ that pursuant to _Section 3.02_ the Escrow Amount
consisting of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered by Parent to the Escrow
Agent to be held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. On the date that is one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time, any such cash or New
Certificates remaining in the possession of the Exchange Agent (together with
any earnings in respect thereof) shall be delivered to (or as directed by)
Parent. Any holder of Company Common Units who has not theretofore exchanged
his, her, or its Company Common Units pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ shall
thereafter be entitled to look exclusively to Parent, and only as a general
creditor thereof, for the consideration to which he, she, or it may be
entitled upon exchange of such Company Common Units pursuant to this _ARTICLE
III_. Notwithstanding the

 



43  foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable
to any holder of Company Common Units for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or
similar laws.

(b) _Exchange Procedures for Company Common Units_. Promptly after
the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) days thereafter, the
Surviving Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each
person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Company Common Units a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery to the Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in
effecting exchange for the consideration to which such person may be entitled
pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Company Common Units shall promptly
be provided in exchange therefor, but in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days after due surrender, a New Certificate and a check, ACH payment, or a
wire transfer in the amount to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
_ARTICLE III_ , and the Company Common Units so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any cash or other
property to be delivered upon surrender of any Company Common Units. Each of
Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Units such amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local,
or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Entity, or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holders of Company Common Units in respect of which the deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Entity, or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, and such amounts shall be timely delivered by
Parent, the Surviving Entity, or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, to
the applicable taxing authority.

 

(c) _Transfer to Holder other than Existing Holder_. If any cash payment is to
be made in a name other than that in which the Company Common Units
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer
or other Taxes required solely by reason of the making of such payment in
a name other than that of the registered holder of the Company Common Units
surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or
requesting person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any New
Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a
name other than that of the registered holder of the Company Common Units
surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of such issuance
that the Company Common Units so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required solely by
reason of the issuance of a certificate representing Company Common Units in a
name other than that of the registered holder of the Company Common
Units surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder
or requesting person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



44 (d) _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Common Units until the holder thereof
shall surrender such Company Common Units in accordance with this _ARTICLE
III_. After the surrender of a Company Common Unit in accordance with this
_ARTICLE III_ , the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock represented by the New Certificate.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any certificate evidencing a
Company Common Unit or Company Option shall have been lost, stolen, or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by Parent
or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, Parent or
the Exchange Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed
certificate, pay or cause to be paid the consideration deliverable in respect
of the Company Common Units or Company Options formerly represented by such
certificate pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_.

Section 3.05. _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment Determination_. 

(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Member
Representative the following (collectively, the " _Preliminary Adjustment
Statement_ "):

(i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Business Entities and
Related Consolidated Entities as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet_ "), prepared by Parent in
accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent with the Audited Financial
Statements; and

(ii) a statement setting forth reasonably detailed calculations by Parent of
the Net Working Capital and the Indebtedness Amount, in each case as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time based on the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Adjustment Amounts_ ") and prepared in a manner
consistent with _Exhibit B_ and in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis
consistent with the Audited Financial Statements;  _provided_ that Net
Working Capital and Indebtedness Amount shall be calculated in accordance with
the definitions of those terms herein.

(b) If the Member Representative disagrees with the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet or Parents calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amounts, the
Member Representative shall promptly, but in no event later than forty-five
(45) days after receiving the Preliminary Adjustment Statement (the " _Review
Period_ "), deliver to Parent written notice describing in reasonable detail
its dispute by specifying those items or amounts as to which the Member
Representative disagrees, together with the Member Representatives
determination of

 



45  such disputed items and amounts (a " _Disagreement Notice_ "). If the Member
Representative either gives notice that it agrees with Parents calculation of
the Closing Adjustment Amounts or fails to deliver a Disagreement Notice
within the Review Period, Parent and the Member Representative agree that
effective as of the date of delivery of the notice of agreement or as of the
close of business on the last day of the Review Period, as applicable, the
Closing Adjustment Amounts set forth in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
shall be final, conclusive, and binding on Parent, the Company, and the
Members and shall constitute the respective "Final Adjustment Amounts" for
purposes of _Section 3.05(b)(v)_. If the Member Representative delivers a
Disagreement Notice to Parent within the Review Period, any item not expressly
set forth in the Disagreement Notice as the subject of the disagreement shall
be final, conclusive, and binding on Parent, the Company, and the Members, and
the Member Representative and Parent shall resolve all disputed items set
forth in the Disagreement Notice as follows:

 

(i) The Member Representative and Parent shall use reasonable good faith
efforts to resolve the dispute during the thirty (30) day period (the "
_Resolution Period_ ") commencing on the date the Member Representative
delivers the Disagreement Notice to Parent, and any such resolution shall be
final and binding on Parent, the Company, and the Members. If the Member
Representative and Parent are not able to resolve all disputed items within
the Resolution Period, then the items in dispute shall be promptly submitted
(if practicable, within five (5) Business Days following the expiration
of the Resolution Period) to the Neutral Accountant.

(ii) The Neutral Accountant shall be given reasonable access to all relevant
work papers, financial information, books, records, schedules, memoranda, and
other documents prepared or reviewed by Parent or any of its accountants or
other representatives that are relevant to the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement, and to all personnel, including accounting personnel,
involved in the preparation of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, in
connection with its calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amounts, _provided_
that such access shall not include any access to documents to the extent
prepared primarily in anticipation of, or for the purposes of evaluating, any
potential dispute, litigation, or arbitration concerning the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement or the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amounts.

(iii) If any remaining items in dispute are submitted to the Neutral
Accountant for resolution (such items, the " _Unresolved Items_ "), each of
Parent and the Member Representative shall submit to the Neutral Accountant
(with a copy delivered to the other party on the same day), within ten (10)
Business Days after the date of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant, a
memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting forth their
respective positions on the Unresolved Items. Each of Parent and the Member
Representative may (but shall not be required to) submit to the Neutral
Accountant (with a copy delivered to the other party on the same day), within
twenty (20) Business Days after the date of the engagement of the Neutral
Accountant, a memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted to
the Neutral Accountant by the other party. Unless requested by the Neutral
Accountant in writing, no party hereto may present any additional information
or arguments to the Neutral Accountant, either orally or in writing. 

 



46 (iv) The Neutral Accountant shall use its accounting expertise to
calculate, based solely on the written submissions of Parent, on the one
hand, and the Member Representative, on the other hand, and not by independent
investigation, the Closing Adjustment Amounts and shall be instructed that its
calculation (i) must be made in accordance with the standards and definitions
in this Agreement, and (ii) with respect to each item in dispute, must be
within the range of values established for such amount as determined by
reference to the value assigned to such amount by the Member Representative
in the Disagreement Notice and by Parent in the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement. The Neutral Accountant shall submit such verification and
calculation to the Member Representative and Parent as soon as practicable,
but in any event within thirty (30) days after the remaining issues in dispute
are submitted to the Neutral Accountant. Notwithstanding anything express or
implied in the first sentence of this _Section 3.05(b)(iv)_ to the contrary,
the determination by the Neutral Accountant of the Closing Adjustment Amounts,
as set forth in a written notice delivered to Parent and the Member
Representative by the Neutral Accountant in accordance with this Agreement,
shall be binding and conclusive on Parent, the Company, and the Members.

(v) The Closing Adjustment Amounts as determined after all disputes have been
resolved in accordance with this _Section 3.05_ are referred to herein
collectively as the " _Final Adjustment Amounts_ " and individually as the "
_Final Net Working Capital_ " and the " _Final Indebtedness Amount_ ,"
respectively. The Member Representative and Parent agree that the procedures
set forth in this _Section 3.05_ for resolving disputes with respect to the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Adjustment Amounts shall be the
sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes. The Neutral
Accountants determination may be entered and enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction, and the substance of the Neutral Accountants
determination shall not be subject to review or appeal, absent a showing of
fraud by one of the parties in the proceeding or on the part of the Neutral
Accountant.

 

(c) The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be borne equally by
Parent and the Members, with the Members share of any such fees and expenses
being paid from the MR Escrow Account.

(d) In connection with the Member Representatives review of the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement, Parent shall (a) provide reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to relevant work papers,
financial information, books, records, schedules, memoranda, and
other documents prepared or reviewed by Parent or any of its accountants or
other representatives that are relevant to the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement, and to all personnel, including accounting personnel, as are
reasonably necessary or desirable with respect to the review of the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement, and Parent shall provide such access
promptly after a request is made by the Member Representative and/or its
representatives ( _provided_ that such access shall not include any access to
documents to the extent prepared primarily in anticipation of, or for the
purposes of evaluating, any potential dispute, litigation or arbitration
concerning the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of the
Closing Adjustment Amounts), and (b) subject to the foregoing limitations,
request that Parents independent accountant, if any, communicate with the
Member Representative and its representatives with respect to such review.

 



47 (e) It is the intent of the parties to have any determination of Unresolved
Items by the Neutral Accountant proceed in an expeditious manner; however,
any deadline or time period contained herein may be extended or modified by
agreement of the parties and the parties agree that the failure of the Neutral
Accountant to strictly conform to any deadline or time period contained
herein shall not be a basis for seeking to overturn any determination rendered
by the Neutral Accountant.

(f) If the Final Net Working Capital minus the Final Indebtedness Amount (each
as determined pursuant to _Section 3.05(b)_), minus the Target, plus the
Estimated Shortfall Amount is a (x) positive number (such excess, the "
_Total Adjustment Amount_ "), then the Aggregate Final Per Unit Merger
Consideration and the Aggregate Final Per Option Merger Consideration to be
paid by Parent shall be increased by the Final Per Unit Adjustment Payment or
(y) a negative number (such deficit, the " _Total Shortfall Amount_ "), then
the Aggregate Final Per Unit Merger Consideration and the Aggregate Final Per
Option Merger Consideration to be paid by Parent shall be decreased by the
Final Per Unit Shortfall Amount. The amount of any reduction in the Aggregate
Final Per Unit Merger Consideration or the Aggregate Final Per Option Merger
Consideration to be made pursuant to this  _Section 3.05(f)_ shall be
satisfied from the Escrow Fund in cash and Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.02_.

(g) The amount of any increase in the Aggregate Final Per Unit Merger
Consideration and the Aggregate Final Per Option Merger Consideration to be
made pursuant to _Section 3.05(f)_ shall be paid to the Members and the
holders of Company Options, pro rata based on the Fully Diluted Units held by
such Members or attributable to the Company Options held by such holders of
Company Options as of immediately prior to the Closing relative to
Total Outstanding Company Units, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
determination of the Final Adjustment Amounts and, in any event with respect
to any such payment made to the Members, within five (5) Business Days
thereafter;  _provided_ that any such payments made to the holders of Company
Options shall be subject to _Section 3.01(b)(ii)(G)_.

Section 3.06. _Earn-Out_.

(a) _Earn-Out Payments_. As additional merger consideration, at such times as
provided in this _Section 3.06_, a total of up to $275,000,000 (the " _Total
Cash Earn-Out Consideration_ "), divided into two tranches, the first of which
shall consist of $137,500,000 of the Total Cash Earn-Out Consideration (the "
_First Tranche_ ") and the second of which shall consist of $137,500,000 of
the Total Cash Earn-Out Consideration (the " _Second Tranche_ ") (each of the
First Tranche and Second Tranche, an " _Earn-Out Payment_ "), shall be
payable to the Members, holders of Company Options and pursuant to Section
1(b) of the Nevada Settlement Agreements, subject to and in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this _Section 3.06_.

(i) If the Earn-Out EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012
is equal to or greater than $550,000,000, then Parent shall pay to the
Members and holders of Company Options the First Tranche in cash, which shall
be allocated among the Members and holders of Company Options pro rata based
on the Fully Diluted Units held by such Members or attributable to the
Company Options held by such holders of Company Options as of immediately
prior to the Closing relative to Total Outstanding Company Units; _provided_
that any such payments made to the holders of Company Options shall be
subject to _Section 3.01(b)(ii)(G)_.

 



48 (ii) If the Earn-Out EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 is
equal to or greater than $600,000,000, then (x) Parent shall pay to the
Members and holders of Company Options the Second Tranche (less the aggregate
amount payable pursuant to clause (y) below) in cash, which shall be allocated
among the Members and the holders of Company Options pro rata based on the
Fully Diluted Units held by such Members or attributable to the Company
Options held by such holders of Company Options as of immediately prior to the
Closing relative to Total Outstanding Company Units; _provided_ that any such
payments made to the holders of Company Options shall be subject to _Section
3.01(b)(ii)(G)_, and (y) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, any Nevada
Second Tranche Payment that is due and payable pursuant to Section 1(b) of
each of the Nevada Settlement Agreements.

(b) _Procedures Applicable to Determination of the Earn-Out Payments_.

(i) On or before the date that is ten (10) Business Days after Parent has
filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for each Calculation Period, Parent shall
prepare and deliver to the Member Representative a written statement (in each
case, an " _Earn-Out Calculation Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable
detail its determination of Earn-Out EBITDA for the applicable Calculation
Period and its calculation of the resulting Per Unit Earn-Out Payment (in each
case, an " _Earn-Out Calculation_ ").

(ii) The Member Representative shall have forty-five (45) days after receipt
of the Earn-Out Calculation Statement for each Calculation Period (in each
case, the " _Earn-Out Review Period_ ") to review the Earn-Out Calculation
Statement and the Earn-Out Calculation set forth therein. During the Earn-Out
Review Period and solely for purposes reasonably related to the
determinations of Earn-Out EBITDA and the resulting Per Unit Earn-Out Payment,
the Member Representative and its accountants shall have reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to relevant work
papers, financial information, books, records, schedules, memoranda, and other
documents prepared or reviewed by Parent or any of its accountants or other
representatives that are relevant to the Earn-Out Calculation Statement or
the Earn-Out Calculation, and to all personnel, including accounting
personnel, as are reasonably necessary or desirable with respect to the review
of the Earn-Out Calculation Statement and the Earn-Out Calculation (
_provided_ that such access shall not include any access to documents to the
extent prepared primarily in anticipation of, or for the purposes of
evaluating, any potential dispute, litigation or arbitration concerning the
Earn-Out Calculation Statement or the calculation of Earn-Out EBITDA). Prior
to the expiration of the Earn-Out Review Period, the Member Representative may
object to the Earn-Out Calculation set forth in the Earn-Out Calculation
Statement for the applicable Calculation Period by delivering a written
notice of objection (an " _Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice_ ") to
Parent; _provided_ that the only basis on which the Member Representative may
dispute any matter in the Earn-Out Calculation is that Parent did not
calculate the Earn-Out Calculation or Earn-Out EBITDA in a manner consistent
with _Exhibit B_ or in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent
with the Audited Financial 

 



49  Statements, or in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the
applicable definitions and other terms hereof). Any Earn-Out Calculation
Objection Notice shall specify the items in the applicable Earn-Out
Calculation or calculation of Earn-Out EBITDA disputed by the Member
Representative and shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for such
objection, as well as the amount in dispute. If the Member Representative
fails to deliver an Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice to Parent prior to
the expiration of the Earn-Out Review Period, then the Earn-Out Calculation
set forth in the Earn-Out Calculation Statement shall be final and binding on
Parent, the Company, and the Members. If the Member Representative timely
delivers an Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice, Parent and the Member
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the disputed items and
agree upon the resulting amount of Earn-Out EBITDA and the Per Unit Earn-Out
Payment for the applicable Calculation Period. If Parent and the Member
Representative are unable to reach agreement within fifteen (15) days after
such an Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice has been given, all unresolved
disputed items shall be promptly referred to the Neutral Accountant. The
Neutral Accountant shall be directed to render a written report on the
unresolved disputed items with respect to the applicable Earn-Out Calculation
and calculation of Earn-Out EBITDA as promptly as practicable, but in no
event greater than thirty (30) days after such submission to the Neutral
Accountant, and to resolve only those unresolved disputed items set forth in
the Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice. If unresolved disputed items are
submitted to the Neutral Accountant, Parent and the Member Representative
shall each furnish to the Neutral Accountant such work papers, schedules, and
other documents and information relating to the unresolved disputed items as
the Neutral Accountant may reasonably request. The Neutral Accountant shall
resolve the disputed items based solely on the applicable definitions and
other terms in this Agreement and the presentations by Parent and the Member
Representative, and not by independent review. The resolution of the dispute
and the calculation of Earn-Out EBITDA and the Per Unit Earn-Out Payment that
is the subject of the applicable Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice by
the Neutral Accountant shall be final and binding on Parent, the Company and
the Members. The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be borne by
the Members, with the Members share of any such fees and expenses being paid
from the MR Escrow Account, and Parent in proportion to the amounts by which
their respective calculations of Earn-Out EBITDA differ from Earn-Out EBITDA
as finally determined by the Neutral Accountant.

 

(c) _Independence of Earn-Out Payments_. Parents obligation to pay each of
the Per Unit Earn-Out Payments to the Members and holders of Company Options
in accordance with _Section 3.06(a)_ is an independent obligation of Parent
and is not otherwise conditioned or contingent upon the satisfaction of any
conditions precedent to any preceding or subsequent Per Unit Earn-Out Payment
and the obligation to pay a Per Unit Earn-Out Payment to the Members and
holders of Company Options shall not obligate Parent to pay any preceding or
subsequent Per Unit Earn-Out Payment. For the avoidance of doubt and by way
of example, if the conditions precedent to the payment of the Per Unit Earn-
Out Payment for the first Calculation Period are not satisfied, but the
conditions precedent to the payment of the Per Unit Earn-Out Payment for the
second Calculation Period are satisfied, then Parent would be obligated to
pay such Per Unit Earn-Out Payment for the second Calculation Period for which
the corresponding conditions precedent have been satisfied, and not the Per
Unit Earn-Out Payment for the first Calculation Period.

 



50 (d) _Timing of Payment of Earn-Out Payments_. Subject to  _Section
3.01(b)(ii)(G)_, any Per Unit Earn-Out Payment that Parent is required to pay
pursuant to _Section 3.06(a)_ hereof shall be paid in full no later than the
later of (i) April 30 following the applicable Calculation Period and (ii)
five (5) Business Days following the date upon which the determination of
Earn-Out EBITDA for the applicable Calculation Period becomes final and
binding upon the parties as provided in  _Section 3.06(b)(ii)_ (including
any final resolution of any dispute raised by the Member Representative in an
Earn-Out Calculation Objection Notice). Parent shall pay to the Members and
holders of Company Options the applicable Per Unit Earn-Out Payment.

(e) _Acceleration upon Parent s Election_. At any time after the Closing
Date, Parent may, in its sole discretion, elect to make either or both of the
following payments to the Members and the holders of Company Options: (i) a
payment equal in amount to the First Tranche, discounted from April 30, 2013
back to the date of actual payment at a rate of 5% per annum, and (ii) a
payment equal in amount to the Second Tranche, discounted from April 30, 2014
back to the date of actual payment at a rate of 5% per annum, it being
understood that from the discounted Second Tranche amount, Parent shall pay,
or cause to be paid, any Nevada Second Tranche Payment that is due and payable
pursuant to Section 1(b) of each of the Nevada Settlement Agreements. Any such
payment shall be made in cash, allocated among the Members and holders of
Company Options pro rata based on the Fully Diluted Units held by such Members
or attributable to the Company Options held by such holders of Company Options
as of immediately prior to the Closing relative to Total Outstanding Company
Units; _provided_ that any such payments made to the holders of Company
Options shall be subject to _Section 3.01(b)(ii)(G)_ and that any payment
made pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Nevada Settlement Agreements shall be
paid in accordance with such provision. Payment in full of the amount set
forth in clause (i) above shall fully release and discharge Parent, its
successors, and assigns from any further liability or obligation pursuant
to this _Section 3.06_ in respect of the First Tranche. Payment in full of
the amount set forth in clause (ii) above shall fully release and discharge
Parent, its successors, and assigns from any further liability or obligation
pursuant to this _Section 3.06_ in respect of the Second Tranche.

(f) _Post-Closing Operation of the Company_. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, subsequent to the Closing and
through December 31, 2013, the chief executive officer and management of the
Company shall operate the business of the Business Entities and Related
Entities on an autonomous basis in a manner substantially consistent with
their current operations. The chief executive officers of the Company and
Parent shall collaborate on major decisions, consistent with appropriate
corporate governance, including Parents corporate policy on acquisitions.
Parents chief executive officer and the Parent Board shall retain ultimate
decision-making authority as it relates to the business. Notwithstanding the
above, to the extent Parent recommends taking or opposing any action or
decision with respect to the business that would reasonably be expected to
adversely impact any Earn-Out Payment and the Companys chief executive
officer is opposed to such Parent recommendation or decision, the Companys
chief executive officer has the right to request that the Parent Board decide
the issue, in which case the matter shall be determined by the Parent 

 



51  Board (and no such taking or opposing such action or decision shall be acted
upon until such time as the Parent Board approves such taking or opposing such
action or decision after considering in good faith the objections of the
Companys chief executive officer). In every event, Parent and the Company
acknowledge that all decisions shall be made in compliance with applicable Law
and in the best interests of the combined company consistent with the
fiduciary duties of the officers and directors of the combined company.
Further, in no event may Parent take any action, or fail to take any action,
in bad faith with the intent of reducing or avoiding any of the Earn-
Out Payments hereunder. Similarly, in no event may the management of the
Company take any action not in the best interests of the combined company with
the intent to ensure any of the Earn-Out Payments hereunder.

 

(g) _No Security_. The parties hereto understand and agree that (i) the
contingent rights to receive any Per Unit Earn-Out Payment shall not be
represented by any form of certificate or other instrument, are not
transferable, except pursuant to a reorganization, liquidation, or other
similar transfer of the assets of the relevant party to its equityholders or
a successor entity or by operation of Laws relating to descent and
distribution, divorce, and community property, and do not constitute an equity
or ownership interest in Parent or the Company, (ii) neither Members nor
holders of Company Options shall have any rights as a securityholder of
Parent or the Company as a result of such contingent right of such Members or
holders of Company Options to receive any Per Unit Earn-Out Payment hereunder,
and (iii) no interest is payable with respect to any Per Unit Earn-Out
Payment.

Section 3.07. _Member Representative Escrow_. A portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration equal to the MR Escrow Amount shall constitute escrowed merger
consideration (the " _MR Escrowed Merger Consideration_ "). The MR Escrowed
Merger Consideration shall be withheld from the Closing Merger
Consideration otherwise deliverable to the Members and holders of Company
Options on the Closing Date to fund, if necessary, (i) the amounts described
in _Section 3.05(c)_, _Section 3.06(b)(ii)_, _Section 3.08_,  _Section
6.15(f)_, _Section 8.08_, and this _Section 3.07_ as being paid from the MR
Escrow Account, (ii) the expenses incurred by the Member Representative acting
in such capacity, and (iii) any other expense described in this Agreement as
being paid from the MR Escrow Account. The MR Escrowed Merger Consideration
shall consist entirely of cash. On the Closing Date, the MR Escrowed Merger
Consideration shall be deposited by Parent with the Escrow Agent in an escrow
account (the " _MR Escrow Account_ ") established in accordance with an escrow
agreement to be entered into between the Member Representative and the Escrow
Agent, consistent with the terms set forth in this Agreement and other
customary terms and conditions for similar agreements (the " _MR Escrow
Agreement_ "). The MR Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Members and the
holders of Company Options are, for federal income tax purposes, the owners
of the MR Escrowed Merger Consideration and are taxable on any earnings
thereon, which tax shall be payable from the funds in the MR Escrow Account.
If any payment is required to be made to or by the Member Representative
acting in such capacity, the Member Representative shall provide written
instructions to the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the MR Escrow
Agreement, to deliver to the Member Representative or the third-party payee
directed by the Member Representative, as the case may be, an amount of cash
equal to such required payment. The MR Escrow Agreement shall provide that on
the First Escrow Distribution Date (and on every anniversary of such date
thereafter), the Member Representative

 



52  and Robert Margolis, M.D. (or his designated successor) shall mutually
determine in good faith what, if any, amount of remaining funds in the MR
Escrow Account should be distributed to the Members and the holders of
Company Options; _provided_ that all of the remaining funds in the MR Escrow
Account (less any amounts required to pay outstanding and anticipated
expenses) shall be distributed to the Members and the holders of Company
Options no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the distribution
of all remaining funds in the Escrow Account, the Healthcare Indemnity
Account, and the Tax Indemnity Account to the Members and the holders of
Company Options. To effectuate any distribution to the Members and the
holders of the Company Options of funds from the MR Escrow Account, the Member
Representative shall provide written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
deliver to the Members and to the holders of the Company Options as of the
Closing the aggregate amount of such distribution to the Members and the
holders of Company Options pro rata based on the Fully Diluted Units held by
such Members or attributable to the Company Options held by such holders of
Company Options as of immediately prior to the Closing relative to Total
Outstanding Company Units. The parties hereto understand and agree that the
contingent rights to receive any funds from the MR Escrow Account are
not transferable, except pursuant to a reorganization, liquidation, or other
similar transfer of the assets of the relevant party to its equityholders or a
successor entity or by operation of Laws relating to descent and distribution,
divorce, and community property, and, in the event of any such transfer, the
Member Representative shall be notified as promptly as reasonably practicable.
The Member Representative shall provide the Majority Member with a written
statement setting forth all distributions and payments made from the MR
Escrow Account (including reasonable detail as to the purpose and amount of
each such distribution or payment and the recipient thereof) for each month in
which the MR Escrow Account is active, no later than twenty (20) Business
Days following the end of such month. The Member Representative shall provide
all Members with a written report for each year in which the MR Escrow Account
is active, no later than ninety (90) days following the end of such year,
setting forth (i) the amount of distributions and payments made from the MR
Escrow Account during such year by category (specifically identifying payments
made to the Member Representative or the Member Representatives affiliated
or related entities), (ii) the total amount of distributions and payments made
from the MR Escrow Account during such year, (iii) the total earnings received
on the funds in the MR Escrow Account during such year, and (iv) the funds
remaining in the MR Escrow as of such years end, and attaching a copy of any
annual statement received by the Member Representative from the Escrow Agent
with respect to the MR Escrow Account. Upon the request of a Member or holder
of Company Options, the Member Representative shall, or shall request the
Escrow Agent to, provide such Member or holder of Company Options with such
information regarding the MR Escrow Account, and any transaction activity
relating thereto, as such Member or holder of Company Options may reasonably
request and at such Members or holder of Company Options sole cost and
expense.

Section 3.08. _Nevada Escrow_. A portion of the Closing Merger Consideration
equal to the Nevada Escrow Amount shall constitute escrowed merger
consideration (the " _Nevada Escrowed Merger Consideration_ "). The Nevada
Escrowed Merger Consideration shall be withheld from the Closing Merger
Consideration otherwise deliverable to the Members and holders of Company
Options on the Closing Date to fund, if applicable, certain transaction
settlement payments that may become due and payable pursuant to Section 1(c)
of each of the Nevada Settlement Agreements. The Nevada

 



53  Escrowed Merger Consideration shall consist entirely of cash. On the Closing
Date, the Nevada Escrowed Merger Consideration shall be deposited by Parent
with the Escrow Agent in an escrow account (the " _Nevada Escrow Account_ ")
established in accordance with an escrow agreement to be entered into among
the Company, the Member Representative, and the Escrow Agent, consistent with
the terms set forth in this Agreement and other customary terms and
conditions for similar agreements (the " _Nevada Escrow Agreement_ "). The
Nevada Escrow Agreement shall provide that Parent is, for federal income tax
purposes, the owner of the Nevada Escrowed Merger Consideration and is
taxable on any earnings thereon. All fees, costs, and expenses (other than
Taxes on any earnings) attributable to the establishment and maintenance of
the Nevada Escrow Account shall be payable from the funds in the MR Escrow
Account. If any transaction settlement payment becomes due and payable
pursuant to Section 1(c) of either Nevada Settlement Agreement, the Company
and the Member Representative shall promptly provide written instructions to
the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Nevada Escrow Agreement, to
deliver to Company out of the funds in the Nevada Escrow Account an amount of
cash equal to such required payment for the sole purpose of making such
required payment pursuant to Section 1(c) of the applicable Nevada Settlement
Agreement. If, pursuant to Section 1(c) of either Nevada Settlement Agreement,
any transaction settlement payment will not be made because a condition
precedent is not met (after giving effect to the shortfall provision
contained therein), then the Company and the Member Representative shall
promptly provide written instructions to the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the
terms of the Nevada Escrow Agreement, to deliver the amount of such unpaid
transaction settlement payment to the Members and to the Company for proper
payment to the holders of the Company Options as of the Closing pro rata based
on the Fully Diluted Units held by such Members or attributable to the Company
Options held by such holders of Company Options as of immediately prior to
the Closing relative to Total Outstanding Company Units, it being understood
that any such payments made to the holders of Company Options shall be subject
to _Section 3.01(b)(ii)(G)_. The parties hereto understand and agree that
the contingent rights to receive any funds from the Nevada Escrow Account are
not transferable, except pursuant to a reorganization, liquidation, or other
similar transfer of the assets of the relevant party to its equityholders or
a successor entity or by operation of Laws relating to descent and
distribution, divorce, and community property.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF THE COMPANY

 

Each representation and warranty contained in this _ARTICLE IV_ is qualified
by disclosures made in the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except with respect
to matters set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

Section 4.01. _Organization, Authority and Qualification of the Company_. The
Company is a limited liability company duly organized and validly existing
under the Laws of the State of California and has all necessary power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which it is a party, to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder,
and to consummate the Transactions. The Company is duly licensed or qualified
to do business and is in good standing (to the extent that such concepts are
recognized under

 



54  applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased
by it or the operation of its business makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so licensed, qualified
or in good standing would not (a) adversely affect the ability of the Company
to carry out its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party or to consummate the Transactions and (b)
have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it
is a party, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been
duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of the Company, and no
other proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party or to
consummate the Transactions (other than obtaining the Member Approval and the
filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the
CLLCA). This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the
Company is a party have been or will be duly executed and delivered by the

and complete fully executed copies of the commitment letters, related term
sheets, and all other related letter agreements or other agreements in effect
on the date hereof (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes, and amendments
thereto), which may be redacted with respect to agent or arranger
fees payable solely to JPMorgan or discounts payable to all underwriters or
initial purchasers with respect to the Unsecured Financing (collectively, the
" _Financing Letter_ ") from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Lender_ ") and
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (" _JPMorgan Securities_ " and together with the
Lender, " _JPMorgan_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Financing Letter, (i) the Lender has committed to
provide a portion of debt financing in the form of loans in the aggregate
amount set forth in the Financing Letter (the debt financing in such amount,
the " _Committed Financing_ "), (ii) JPMorgan Securities has agreed to use
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange debt financing on an uncommitted
basis in the form of loans in an aggregate principal amount set forth therein
for the purpose of financing the Transactions and the other purposes set forth
in such Financing Letter (the debt financing in such amount, the "
_Syndicated Senior Secured Financing_ " and, together with the Committed
Financing, collectively the " _Senior Secured Financing_ "), and (iii) Parent
has engaged JPMorgan Securities on an uncommitted basis to act as bookrunning
manager, underwriter, placement agent, and/or initial purchaser in connection
with the issuance and sale of unsecured debt securities in the principal
amount set forth therein (the " _Unsecured Financing Amount_ ") for the
purpose of financing the Transactions and the other purposes set forth in such
Financing Letter (the issuance and sale of such unsecured debt securities, the
" _Unsecured Financing_ " and, together with the Senior Secured Financing,
the " _Financing_ "). The Financing Letter has been duly executed and
delivered by and constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of each
of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the Lender and JPMorgan
Securities to the extent a party thereto. The Financing Letter has not, as of
the date hereof, been withdrawn, rescinded, or terminated or otherwise
amended, supplemented, or modified in any respect. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of
the conditions in the Financing Letter will not be satisfied, or that the
Financing will not be made available on a timely basis in order to consummate
the Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Lender nor
JPMorgan Securities has notified Parent or Merger Sub in writing of its
intention to withdraw the Financing Letter. As of the date hereof, if the
Financing were consummated on the date hereof, the net proceeds thereof,
together with

 



82  available cash, would be sufficient to fully pay in cash all amounts
required to be paid in cash by Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Transactions, including as required by  _Section 3.04(a)_. As of the date
hereof, other than the Financing Letter and the Existing Credit Agreement (as
defined in the Credit Facility Financing Letter) and the financing documents
related to and contemplated by the Existing Credit Agreement but not entered
into in connection with the Merger, there are no agreements, side letters,
understandings, or arrangements that establish legally binding terms of or
conditions with respect to the Financing to which Parent, Merger Sub, or any
of their respective Affiliates is a party. As of the Closing Date, if the
Financing were consummated on or before the Closing Date, Parent will have all
necessary funds to make each payment required by _Section 3.06_ when due. As
of the Closing Date, there will exist no express restriction in the Financing
Agreement or any other material agreement by which Parent is bound on Parents
ability to make any payment required by _Section 3.06_. As of the date
hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent, the making of any payment required by
_Section 3.06_ would not constitute a material breach of or default under any
material agreement to which Parent is a party or a material violation of Law
to which Parent or any of its properties is subject, other than the Existing
Credit Agreement (as defined in the Credit Facility Financing Letter) and the
financing documents related to and contemplated by the Existing Credit
Agreement but not entered into in connection with the Merger.

the Parent Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports, statements, documents,

enterprise taken as a whole. Each of such filings were complete, correct and

client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene any applicable Laws
(including any Health Care Laws), fiduciary duty, or binding confidentiality
agreement entered into prior to the date hereof (but shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide Parent with alternative disclosure sufficient

Parent Subsidiaries (or copies thereof) as the Company and its authorized
Representatives may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ ,

conducted at the Companys expense, during normal business hours and in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of Parents
business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
shall not be required to provide any such access or disclose any such
information to the Company if such disclosure would (i) jeopardize any
attorney-client

 



91  or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene any applicable Laws (including
any Health Care Laws), fiduciary duty, or binding confidentiality agreement
entered into prior to the date hereof (but shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the Company with alternative disclosure sufficient to
convey the economic effect of the matter). When accessing any of the
properties of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, the Company shall, and shall
use reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to, comply with all safety
and security requirements for such property.

Section 6.06. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

(a) Each party hereto agrees to, and shall cause its respective Affiliates
to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) promptly obtain all
Consents of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for
its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant
to, this Agreement, including taking steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
impediments under any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority and to avoid the entry of, and the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or
preventing the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) cooperate fully with
the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such Consents, and (iii)
provide such other information to any Governmental Authority as such
Governmental Authority may reasonably request in connection herewith. Each
party hereto agrees to, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, make its

respective filings and notifications, if any, and cooperate with the other
parties

privileges (including the attorney-client privilege), each party to this
Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any communication it or any
of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the
matters that are the subject of this _Section 6.06_ and permit the other
party to review in advance (and to consider any comments made by the other
party in relation to) any proposed communication by such party to any
Governmental Authority relating to such matters. Neither of the parties to
this Agreement shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting,
telephone call, or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of
any submissions, filings, investigation (including any settlement of the
investigation), or any other inquiry relating to such matters unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting, telephone call, or discussion. Each party hereto
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, coordinate and
cooperate fully with the other party hereto in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as the other party hereto may reasonably request
in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods, investigation, or any other inquiry under any
applicable Antitrust Laws. The parties to this Agreement shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings, or communications between them or any of their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (i)
as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Laws; and
(ii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

(c) Neither party shall, and each party shall cause its Affiliates not to,
enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction
(including any merger or acquisition), that might reasonably be expected to
make it more difficult, or to increase the time required, to (i) obtain the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law applicable to the Transactions or (ii) obtain all
other authorizations, consents, orders, and approvals of Governmental
Authorities necessary for the consummation of the Transactions.

contracts set forth on _Section 6.06(d)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule to
a professional corporation designated by Parent and any such assignment shall
only become effective at the Effective Time. 

 



93 Section 6.07. _Preparation of Prospectus and Registration Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Parent
shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) the Prospectus and
prepare and file the Registration Statement with respect to the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger. The Registration Statement and the
Prospectus shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
other applicable Law. Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by
the SEC as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other party copies of any written comments and advise
the other party of any oral comments with respect to the Registration
Statement or Prospectus received by such party from the SEC. Parent shall
provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement
thereto, and any response by Parent to any SEC comments with respect thereto,
prior to filing or transmitting such with the SEC, and will promptly provide
the Company with a copy of all such filings or transmittals made with the SEC
to the extent not available on EDGAR. Parent shall also take any action (other
than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or filing a general consent to service of process) required to be
taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Stock and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Units as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Parent will advise
the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration Statement. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time Parent or the Company determines that (i) the
Registration Statement includes a misstatement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (ii) the
Prospectus includes a misstatement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, then
the party (Parent or the Company) that makes such determination shall
promptly notify the other, and Parent shall promptly file an amendment or
supplement to such document describing such information to the extent required
by Law, or the rules or regulations of the SEC, and the Company shall
promptly disseminate such amended or supplemented document to the members of
the Company.

(b) The Company and Parent shall reasonably coordinate and cooperate in
connection with (i) the preparation of the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, and any other filings that are required to consummate the Merger
and the Transactions, (ii) determining whether any action by or in respect
of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required (or any actions are
required to be taken under, or consents, approvals, or waivers are required to
be obtained from parties to, any Material Contracts) in connection with the
Merger or the other Transactions, and (iii) using commercially reasonable
efforts to timely take any such actions (including seeking any such consents,
approvals, or waivers) or making any such filings or furnishing information
required in connection therewith or with the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, or any other filings.

 



94 Section 6.08. _Financing_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that its obligations hereunder are not
conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining any financing,
and the existence of any conditions contained in the Financing Letter or the
Financing Agreement shall not constitute, or be construed to constitute, a
condition to the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not limit in any manner the ability of the Company or
Parent to terminate this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 9.01_, the
sole remedy for any such termination described in _Section 9.03(a)(i)_,
_(ii)_ , or _(iii)_ , except in the case of an intentional breach of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, being the payment by Parent of the
Termination Fee and the amounts set forth in _Section 9.03(b)_.

(b) Without limiting  _Section 6.08(a)_:

(i) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary to arrange and obtain the Financing as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, including using their reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain
in effect, and comply on a timely basis with their obligations under, the
Financing Letter, (B) negotiate and enter into, keep in effect, and comply on
a timely basis with their obligations under definitive agreements (the "
_Financing Agreement_ ") with respect to the Financing, and (C) satisfy on a
timely basis all terms and conditions (including conditions precedent) in the
Financing Letter or the Financing Agreement, other than obligations of parties
to the Financing Letter or the Financing Agreement other than Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates controlled by either of them. Parent
and Merger Sub shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary to consummate the Financing, at or prior to
the Closing, if the Financing is available (including that all conditions
precedent for the Senior Secured Financing and Unsecured Financing, other than
execution and delivery of the Financing Agreement with respect to the Senior
Secured Financing or Unsecured Financing, as the case may be, and consummation
of the Merger, have been met or concurrently with the consummation of the
Senior Secured Financing or Unsecured Financing, as applicable, will be met
and no facts or circumstances exist that violate the terms of the Financing
Agreement with respect to the Senior Secured Financing and would entitle the
lenders to accelerate obligations thereunder) to Parent or Merger Sub on the
Anticipated Financing Terms. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a
true, correct, and complete fully executed copy of any amendment, supplement,
modification, or waiver to the Financing Letter as promptly as practicable
following the execution thereof. Parent shall (x) furnish to the Company
complete, correct, and executed copies of the Financing Agreement promptly
upon its execution (except that any arranger or agent fees payable solely to
JPMorgan may be redacted) and drafts of such documents posted to a lender
group and (y) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of
the efforts of Parent and Merger Sub to arrange the Financing. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub will not permit or suffer to exist any express restriction, in
the Financing Agreement or otherwise, on Parents ability to make any payment
required by _Section 3.06_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will not enter into
any agreement that it knows will be breached by the making of any payment
required by _Section 3.06_.

 



95 (ii) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice (x) of any breach or default
by any party to the Credit Facility Financing Letter or any Financing
Agreement of which Parent becomes aware, or (y) of the receipt of any written
notice from JPMorgan or any other lender, initial purchaser, underwriter,
holder or trustee with respect to (A) any breach, default, termination, or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Letter or the Financing Agreement or
any provisions of the Financing Letter or the Financing Agreement or (B) any

information, and Parent and Merger Sub shall consider in good faith any
comments proposed by the Company to such offering memorandum or prospectus.
The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Business Entities
logos in connection with the Financing in a manner customary for similar
financing transactions. Nothing in this _Section 6.08_ shall require
cooperation by the Company, any Business Entity, or any Related Consolidated
Entity or their respective Representatives to the extent such cooperation

or obligation in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall indemnify and hold harmless each Member and its
Affiliates, Representatives, and equityholders from and against any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement or
offering of the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith
(except to the extent that such Losses arise as a result of disclosure by any
of the Business Entities or any Related Consolidated Entities supplied to
Parent or its Representatives in writing for use in the Financing that is
determined to have contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein not
misleading).

(d) The Company shall deliver to Parent: (i) no later than May 31, 2012, the
audited balance sheet of the Business Entities and the Related Consolidated
Entities as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 and the related
audited statements of income and cash flows of the Business Entities and the
Related Consolidated Entities for each of the fiscal years then ended prepared

avoidance of doubt, need not include a management discussion and analysis) and

beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2012 (but with such obligation
ceasing upon the Closing), the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the

such quarter and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income and
cash flows of the Business Entities and the Related Consolidated Entities for

recurring year-end adjustments, and which shall have been reviewed by Ernst and
Young LLP in accordance with Statements on Auditing Standards 100 issued by
the Auditing Standards Board (or any successor standard thereto).

such earlier date on which this Agreement may be terminated in accordance
with its terms, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate
(at Parents expense) in the defense or settlement of any member litigation
against the Company and its managers relating to the Transactions; _provided_
, _however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). For purposes of this _Section 6.09_, "participate"
means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised by the Company of proposed
strategy and other significant decisions with respect to any member litigation
(to the extent the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its
counsel is not undermined or otherwise adversely affected), and the Company
will make reasonable efforts to allow Parent to observe any deposition or
other pre-trial meeting, and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with
respect to the litigation but will not be afforded any decision making power
or authority over the litigation, except for the right to consent to any
settlement as set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

 

Section 6.10. _Further Action_.

(a) The parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper,

and other papers as may be required to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary Consents required
to be obtained by it from third parties (other than Governmental Authorities)
in connection with the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide reasonable assistance to the other
party in obtaining such Consents.

Section 6.11.  _Intercompany Indebtedness and Agreements_.

(a) In connection with the Closing and the transactions contemplated by 
_Section 2.01_, the Company shall take, or shall cause its Affiliates to
take, all actions necessary, in accordance with agreements and other
instruments reasonably acceptable to Parent, so that, as of immediately
following the Closing, there shall be no Intercompany Indebtedness;
_provided_ that such elimination of Intercompany Indebtedness shall not be
required to the extent (i) there is insufficient cash maintained on the
balance sheet of any Business Entity or Related Consolidated Entity to pay
down any Intercompany Indebtedness, (ii) any such Intercompany Indebtedness is
required for any Business Entity or Related Consolidated Entity to remain in
compliance with applicable financial solvency ratios, including those
established by the California Department of Managed Health Care, or (iii) any
such Intercompany Indebtedness is required to ensure that a Business Entity or
a Related Consolidated Entity maintains sufficient working capital and cash-
on-hand to fund its ongoing business operations.

 



99 (b) For the avoidance of doubt, the agreements between one or more Business

hand, that are set forth in _Exhibit F_ shall remain in full force and effect
following the Closing, each in accordance with their respective terms.

commercially reasonable efforts, to take all actions and execute all
instruments necessary to effectively transfer to a Business Entity or a
Related Entity prior to the Closing the lessees or sublessees interest in
each leased property or subleased property, as the case may be, identified in
_Section 4.18(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule as not currently being
in the name of a Business Entity or Related Consolidated Entity.

taken pursuant to _Section 6.11(c)_ or _Section 6.11(d)_ shall be excluded
from the calculations of Earn-Out EBITDA.

cause its corporate name to be changed to "DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc." by
filing a Certificate of Ownership and Merger with the Secretary of State of

each other Parent incumbent directors re-nomination when the Nominating and
Governance Committee of the Parent Board (the " _Committee_ ") determines each
year, in accordance with the Committees charter and the Corporate Governance
Guidelines of DaVita, which directors it shall select as nominees or recommend
to the Parent Board for nomination for election to the Parent Board at the
Annual Meeting.

 



100  (c) Upon his appointment or election to Parent Board, for a minimum period of
four (4) consecutive Annual Meetings, the Executive shall hold the office of

the extent any such Tax Return is required to be filed within thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date, the Member Representative shall deliver such Tax

a draft of such Tax Return to the Member Representative no later than thirty
(30) days prior to the due date thereof (after giving effect to any extensions

Member Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed. Any Tax refunds or credits that are received by Parent, any
Business Entity, or any Related Entity following the Closing Date and that
directly relate to Indemnified Taxes (or that relate to Taxes or Tax reserves
that are taken into account as a current liability for purposes of
calculating Final Net Working Capital) shall be for the account of the
Members and the holders of Company Options, and Parent shall pay over the
amount of any such refund or credit to the Member Representative on behalf of
the Members and the holders of Company Options within thirty (30) days after

shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision
of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Returns or audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees or
other persons available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional

 



102   information and explanation of any material provided hereunder and to assist
in the preparation of Tax Returns. Parent, the Company, and the Member
Representative agree (i) to retain (and Parent and the Company agree to cause
the Business Entities and Related Consolidated Entities to retain) all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Business Entities or
the Related Consolidated Entities relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Parent or the Member Representative, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by
(and Parent and the Company agree to cause the Business Entities and Related
Consolidated Entities to abide by) all record retention agreements entered
into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give (and Parent and the Company
agree to cause the Business Entities and Related Consolidated Entities to
give) the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, Parent, the Company, or the Member Representative, as the case may
be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records.
Parent, the Company, and, following the Closing, the Member Representative
further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable efforts to obtain (or
cause to be obtained) any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the Transactions or
otherwise. 

(d) _Information Reporting_. Parent, the Company, and the Member
Representative agree, upon request, to provide (and Parent and the Company,
agree, upon request, to cause the Business Entities and Related Consolidated
Entities to provide) the other party with all information in their possession
or control that either party may be required to report pursuant to Section
6043 or Section 6043A of the Code, or Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

(e) _Conveyance Taxes_. The liability for all Conveyance Taxes shall be borne
50% by the Members and 50% by Parent. Parent, the Company and, following the
Closing, the Member Representative shall cooperate and, as required by
applicable Law, join, and Parent or the Company shall cause the Business
Entities or the Related Consolidated Entities to join, as applicable, in the
execution of all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
Conveyance Taxes.

 

(f) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the Closing Date, Parent and the Member Representative shall jointly prepare
or cause to be prepared an allocation (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ ") of
the consideration delivered pursuant to this Agreement (and all other
capitalized costs) among the acquired assets of the Business Entities in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations issued
thereunder (and any similar provisions of state, local, or other Law, as
appropriate), which allocation shall be binding upon the parties
for applicable U.S. federal income and state and local and other Tax
purposes. Following the Closing, Parent and the Member Representative and
their respective representatives shall cooperate in the preparation of the
Purchase Price Allocation, including by Parent allowing the Member
Representative and its representatives to have reasonable access to personnel
of Parent, the Business Entities and the Related Entities and to such records
and other information as reasonably necessary or desirable to prepare the
Purchase Price Allocation. If the parties do not agree on a final form of the
Purchase Price Allocation within the one hundred twenty (120) day period, then
each party shall (i) provide to the other 

 



103   party such partys proposed form of Purchase Price Allocation, and (ii)
specify in writing those aspects of the form of Purchase Price Allocation
proposed by the other party that such party disputes. The parties shall
thereafter negotiate in good faith for a further period of fifteen (15)
Business Days in order to resolve such disputes. If the parties do not reach
an agreement in writing as to the Purchase Price Allocation within the
foregoing timeframe, then the matters disputed by the parties shall be
submitted for arbitration by a nationally recognized accounting firm that
agrees to use its best efforts to complete such arbitration within forty-five
(45) days and that is reasonably acceptable to (and independent of) Parent
and the Member Representative (the " _Purchase Price Allocation Accounting
Firm_ "), which shall arbitrate the dispute and submit a written statement of
its adjudication, which statement, when delivered to Parent and the Member
Representative, shall become final and binding upon the parties and shall,
together with those aspects of the proposed forms of Purchase Price Allocation
submitted by the parties as to which no objection was made, constitute the
Purchase Price Allocation. If Parent and the Member Representative do not
agree on the Purchase Price Allocation Accounting Firm after a reasonable
period of time, the Purchase Price Allocation Accounting Firm shall be
Deloitte LLP. The Purchase Price Allocation Accounting Firm shall be
instructed that it may only consider those items set forth in the proposed
forms of Purchase Price Allocation that are in dispute. The determination of
the Purchase Price Allocation Accounting Firm shall (i) be within the range
of dispute between Parent and the Member Representative, and (ii) constitute
an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon which a
judgment may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The fees
and expenses of the Purchase Price Allocation Accounting Firm shall be borne
equally by Parent and the Members, with the Members share of any such fees
and expenses being paid from the MR Escrow Account. Parent and the Member
Representative shall, and Parent shall cause the Business Entities and the
Related Consolidated Entities to, report, act and file Tax Returns in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation.
Parent and the Member Representative shall, and Parent shall cause the
Business Entities and the Related Consolidated Entities to, timely and
properly prepare, execute, file and deliver all such documents, forms and
other information as may be reasonably requested by Parent or the Member
Representative to prepare the Purchase Price Allocation. Neither Parent nor
the Member Representative shall take, and Parent shall cause the Business
Entities and the Related Consolidated Entities not to take, any position
(whether in audits, Tax Returns, financial statements, or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with such Purchase Price Allocation unless required to do so by
applicable Law.

 

(g) _Company Options_. The parties hereto agree that any available Tax
deductions attributable to (i) the exercise of Company Options pursuant to
this Agreement, (ii) payments made on or prior to the Closing Date with
respect to the cancellation of Company Options pursuant to this Agreement,
(iii) payments made on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the Nevada
Settlement Agreements, or (iv) any severance payments or other compensation
paid or accrued directly by any of the Business Entities or the Related
Entities and in respect of an employment relationship maintained with such
Business Entity or Related Entity prior to or as of the Closing Date, shall
in each case be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall be for the
benefit of the Members, and the parties hereto shall act and prepare and file
all Tax Returns, and shall cause their Affiliates to act and prepare and file
all Tax Returns, in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such
treatment and in accordance with applicable Law.

 



104  (h) _Pre-Closing Liquidation of Blocker Corporation_. In connection with the
Closing and the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.01_, and
notwithstanding anything in _Section 6.01_ to the contrary, the Company shall
take, or shall cause its Affiliates to take, all actions necessary, in
accordance with agreements and instruments reasonably acceptable to Parent,
so that (i) prior to the Merger, HCP Blocker Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Blocker Corporation_ "), shall either merge with and into the
Company with the Company surviving or otherwise be completely liquidated for
all applicable tax purposes and cease to exist as a separate entity (the "
_Liquidation_ ") and (ii) in connection with the Liquidation, the Class A
Units held by Blocker Corporation shall be redeemed, cancelled, or otherwise
eliminated by the Company. Following the Closing, the Member Representative
shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file or cause to be
timely filed, any Tax Returns required to be filed by Blocker Corporation,
including its final Tax Returns for the year in which the Liquidation occurs
(the " _Blocker Tax Returns_ "), to the extent not filed prior to the Closing,
and the Member Representative shall also ensure that the Liquidation is
properly reflected and reported on such Blocker Tax Returns as a taxable
liquidation that occurred in the Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company;
_provided_ that the Member Representative (or, if prior to the Closing,
the Company) shall deliver or cause to be delivered a draft of any Blocker
Tax Return that is to be filed to Parent no later than thirty (30) days prior
to the due date thereof (after giving effect to any extensions for filing),
and the Member Representative (or, if prior to the Closing, the Company)
shall make such revisions to such Blocker Tax Return as are reasonably
requested by Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that to the extent any such
Blocker Tax Return is required to be filed within thirty (30) days after the
Closing Date, the Member Representative shall deliver or cause to be delivered
a draft of any such Blocker Tax Return to Parent as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date, and in a manner that allows Parent adequate time
to sufficiently review such Blocker Tax Return. In addition, in connection
with the filing of any Blocker Tax Return to be filed by or on behalf of the
Member Representative after the Closing and pursuant to the
preceding sentence, and no later than the date on which any such Blocker Tax
Return is filed, Parent shall timely pay (or cause one of its Affiliates to
timely pay) an amount of cash equal to the portion of the Blocker Tax
Liability shown as owing on such Blocker Tax Return on behalf of Blocker
Corporation and the Company, and shall coordinate with the Member
Representative to ensure that such amount is properly remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority on behalf of Blocker Corporation and the Company
in connection with the filing of the applicable Blocker Tax Return. For the
avoidance of doubt, the payment of Taxes in respect of the Blocker Tax
Liability by Parent (or by one of Parents Affiliates) on behalf of Blocker
Corporation and the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.15(h)_ shall not
prevent Parent from seeking indemnity pursuant to _Section 8.02(d)_ in the
event that any additional Taxes that are not taken into account for purposes
of determining Final Net Working Capital are subsequently owed in respect of
the Blocker Tax Liability and in connection with the Liquidation.

 

Section 6.16. _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Business Entities and Related
Consolidated Entities to, cooperate and work with Parent to help Parent
identify employees of HCPMGI who provide non-medical services to the Business
Entities or Related Entities and whose employment will be transferred to the
Surviving Entity, Parent, or any of their Subsidiaries (the "
_Affected Employees_ "). Such transfer of the Affected Employees shall occur
effective as of the Closing Date, unless Parent gives written notice to the
Company at least sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date that such transfer
of Affected Employees shall instead occur as of January 1, 2013 (either such
transfer date referred to herein as the " _Employee Transfer Date_ "). With
respect to the Affected Employees, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Business Entities and Related Consolidated Entities to, assist Parent in its
efforts to enter into, or have the Company or any of their Subsidiaries enter
into, an offer letter or such other service arrangement as Parent shall deem
appropriate with such employee as soon as practicable after the date hereof
and in any event prior to the Employee Transfer Date, which offer or
arrangement shall be effective immediately following the Employee Transfer
Date. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Entity, or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any
obligation to make an offer of employment or provide such other service
arrangement to, or otherwise transfer the employment of, any employee of
HCPMGI who solely provides medical services to the Business Entities or
Related Entities. Effective immediately following the Employee Transfer Date,
the Company shall, and shall cause the Business Entities and Related
Consolidated Entities to, take all action necessary to cause HCPMGI to
terminate the employment of each of the Affected Employees who has received,
but not accepted, an offer of employment or such other service arrangement as
Parent shall deem appropriate with Parent, the Company, the Surviving Entity,
or any of their Subsidiaries effective immediately following the Employee
Transfer Date. Affected Employees who accept offers of employment from, or
whose employment will otherwise be transferred to, Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Entity, or any of their Subsidiaries shall be referred to
herein as " _Transferred Employees_ ". Parent shall promptly reimburse the
Business Entities and the Related Consolidated Entities for their reasonable,
out-of-pocket costs incurred as a result of complying with this _Section
6.16(a)_ with respect to the Affected Employees, other than any such costs
that result from the Business Entities or the Related Consolidated Entities
violation of applicable Law, unless such violation of Law occurred as a
result of the Business Entities or the Related Consolidated Entities
compliance with this _Section 6.16(a)_. Any and all expenses arising from or
related to any action taken pursuant to this _Section 6.16(a)_ shall be
excluded from the calculations of Earn-Out EBITDA. Any and all Liabilities
arising from or related to any action taken pursuant to this _Section 6.16(a)_
shall be excluded from the calculations of Indebtedness Amount and Net
Working Capital. Any and all cash expended in the compliance with this Section
6.16(a) (net of any reimbursement received by any Business Entity or Related
Consolidated Entity from Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.16(a)_ ) that
would otherwise have reduced Net Working Capital shall be added back to Net
Working Capital.

 



105  (b) Without limiting any additional rights that current employees of the
Business Entities who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Entity,
or any of their Affiliates following the Closing Date (such employees, with
the Transferred Employees, referred to herein as " _Continuing Employees_ ")
may have under any Plan, from and after the Effective Time and until December
31, 2013, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and each of the Related
Entities to maintain the severance practices and policies of the Company and
the Related Entities that are set forth on _Section 6.16(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Severance Arrangements_ ") in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth therein and provide the severance benefits set
forth therein to any Continuing Employee whose employment is involuntarily
terminated by Parent, the Surviving Entity, or any of their Affiliates
following the Effective Time (or following the Employee Transfer Date in the
case of Transferred Employees) but on or before December 31, 2013, under
circumstances that would otherwise entitle such individual to severance
benefits in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Severance
Arrangements, _provided_ that the provision of such severance benefits would
be consistent with past practice.

(c) From and after the Effective Time (or from and after the Employee Transfer
Date in the case of Transferred Employees) and until December 31, 2013, the
base salary, target annual bonus opportunity, and target commission
opportunity in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing Date shall not be
decreased for the Continuing Employees that remain employed during that
period.

(d) From and after the Effective Time and until December 31, 2013, with
respect to Continuing Employees other than the Transferred Employees, Parent
will cause the Surviving Entity (or its Subsidiaries) to maintain for such
Continuing Employees each Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA (other than

 



106   the Severance Arrangements) and each other Plan that provides vacation,
sick, or personal time off (collectively, the " _Welfare Plans_ ") pursuant to
its terms in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the
extent any such plan must be amended to comply with applicable Law. Effective
as of January 1, 2014, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity (or
its Subsidiaries) to, either (i) continue the Welfare Plans or adopt new
employee welfare plans, programs, or arrangements, (ii) permit such Continuing
Employees to participate in the employee welfare plans, programs, or policies
(including any severance, vacation, sick, or personal time off plans or
programs) of Parent or its Affiliates, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i)
or (ii). From and after January 1, 2014, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, (y) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its
Affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees (other than the
Transferred Employees) to the extent such Continuing Employees were not
subject to such preexisting conditions and limitations and eligibility
waiting periods under the comparable Welfare Plan as of immediately prior to
January 1, 2014, and (z) with respect to a Welfare Plan that provides for
group health plan benefits and has a plan year that is other than the
calendar year, provide each such Continuing Employee with credit for any
deductibles or out of pocket expenses paid under such Plan in the plan year in
effect as of January 1, 2014, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out
of pocket requirements under any group health plans of Parent or its
Affiliates that such employees are eligible to participate in as of January 1,
2014, to the same extent that such expenses were recognized under the
comparable Welfare Plan.

(e) From and after the Employee Transfer Date and until December 31, 2013,
with respect to the Transferred Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Entity (or its Subsidiaries) to, either (i) continue or commence
participation in the Welfare Plans or other employee welfare plans, programs,
or arrangements of a Related Entity in which such Transferred Employees
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time or adopt new employee
welfare plans, programs, or arrangements that are substantially identical to
or more favorable than such plans, programs, or arrangements (the " _New
Plans_ "), (ii) permit such Transferred Employees to participate in the
employee welfare plans, programs, or policies (including any severance,
vacation, sick, or personal time off plans or programs) of Parent or its
Affiliates, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) or (ii); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the benefits provided to the Transferred Employees are
substantially identical to or more favorable than the benefits provided to
such Transferred Employees pursuant to the Welfare Plans or other employee
welfare plans, programs, or arrangements of a Related Entity in which they
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Effective as of January
1, 2014, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity (or its
Subsidiaries) to, either (i) continue participation in the Welfare Plans or
other employee welfare plans, programs, or arrangements of a Related Entity,
continue the New Plans or adopt new employee welfare plans, programs, or
arrangements, (ii) permit the Transferred Employees to participate in the
employee welfare plans, programs, or policies (including any severance,
vacation, sick, or personal time off plans or programs) of Parent or its
Affiliates, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) or (ii). From and after the
Employee Transfer Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i)
cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting
periods under any New Plan or the group health plans of Parent or its
Affiliates in which a Transferred Employee will participate to be waived with
respect to such Transferred Employee to the extent such Transferred Employee
was not subject to such preexisting conditions and limitations and
eligibility waiting periods under the comparable employee welfare plans,
programs, or arrangements of the Surviving Entity or a

 



107   Related Entity in which such Transferred Employee participated as of
immediately prior to the date the Transferred Employees participation will
commence under any New Plan or the group health plans of Parent or its
Affiliates, as applicable, and (ii) provide each Transferred Employee with
credit for any deductibles or out of pocket expenses paid under such employee
welfare plans, programs, or arrangements of the Surviving Entity or a Related
Entity in which such Transferred Employee participated as of immediately prior
to the date the Transferred Employees participation will commence under any
New Plan or the group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates,
as applicable, in the plan year in effect as of such date in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out of pocket requirements under any New Plan or
group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates that such employee is eligible
to participate in to the same extent that such expenses were recognized under
the comparable employee welfare plans, programs, or arrangements of the
Surviving Entity or a Related Entity.

(f) From and after the Effective Time and until December 31, 2013, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries to, maintain,
or as applicable commence or continue participation in, each Plan intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement pursuant to its terms in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent any such plan
must be amended to comply with applicable Law. 

(g) From and after the Employee Transfer Date and until December 31, 2013,
with respect to the Transferred Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Entity (or its Subsidiaries) to adopt a new nonqualified deferred
compensation plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that the benefits provided to each
Transferred Employee who elects to participate in such deferred compensation
plan are no less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits provided to such
Transferred Employees pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan or Deferred
Compensation Plan 2 of HCPMGI in which the Transferred Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time. It is the intent of the parties that
in the event any Transferred Employee is paid a distribution or commences
receipt of distributions pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan or
Deferred Compensation Plan 2 of HCPMGI as a result of his or her termination
of employment from HCPMGI in connection with the Closing, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Entity (or its Subsidiaries) to, pay to the
Transferred Employee an amount in cash to make the Transferred Employee whole
for the income taxes payable with respect to any such distributions (the " _DC
Distribution Tax Payment_ "), as well as any income and employment taxes
payable on the DC Distribution Tax Payment (the " _Income Tax Payment_ " and
together with the DC Distribution Tax Payment, the " _Deferred Compensation
Tax Payment_ ") such that the Transferred Employee is in no worse position
than if no distribution from the Deferred Compensation Plan or Deferred
Compensation Plan 2 had occurred. With respect to a Transferred Employee who
has elected or is required to receive a lump sum distribution, the Deferred
Compensation Tax Payment shall be paid within fifteen (15) Business Days of
the distribution. Following the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent
shall work together in good faith to determine (i) whether any distributions
from the Deferred Compensation Plan or Deferred Compensation Plan 2 of HCPMGI
are scheduled to be made to individuals who are anticipated to be Transferred
Employees in the form of either a lump sum or installments and (ii) when the
Deferred Compensation Tax Payment will be made to eligible Transferred
Employees who have elected distributions in the form of installment payments.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Parent
shall be solely liable and responsible for all Liabilities arising from or
related to, the Deferred Compensation Tax Payment and in no event shall any
Member be deemed, pursuant to _Section 8.02_ , to have indemnified any Parent
Indemnified Party for any Losses arising from or related to Deferred
Compensation Tax Payment and (ii) (x) any and all expenses arising from or
related to the Deferred Compensation Tax Payment shall be excluded from the
calculations of Earn-Out EBITDA, (y) any and all Liabilities arising from or
related to the Deferred Compensation Tax Payment shall be excluded from the
calculations of Indebtedness Amount and Net Working Capital, and (z) any and
all cash expended in making the Deferred Compensation Tax Payment that would
otherwise have reduced Net Working Capital shall be added back to Net Working
Capital. 

 



108  (h) As of the date Continuing Employees are eligible to participate in the
employee benefit plans, programs, or policies of Parent or its Affiliates
(the " _Parent Plans_ "), Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Entity to,
give Continuing Employees full credit under such Parent Plans for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and determination of level of benefits (but not to the
extent that such credit would result in duplication of benefits) for the
Continuing Employees service with the Business Entities and Related Entities
and their predecessor entities to the same extent recognized by the Company,
the Business Entities, and the Related Entities immediately prior to the
Effective Time under an analogous Plan.

(i) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity and each of the Parent
Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending ninety
(90) days thereafter, not to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as
those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act of 1988 (together with any similar state or local Law, " _WARN_ ") without
complying with all provisions of WARN or any similar provision of applicable
foreign Law. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
in the event Parent terminates, or requests or causes the termination of, the
employment of any employee of any Business Entity or Related Entity with such
Business Entity or Related Entity on or following the Closing (whether or not
such employee is thereafter promptly employed by any Business Entity or
Related Entity), (i) Parent shall be solely liable and responsible
for compliance with, and for all Liabilities arising from or related to, such
termination under WARN and any similar state or local law or ordinance and in
no event shall any Member be deemed, pursuant to _Section 8.02_ , to have
indemnified any Parent Indemnified Party for any Losses arising from or
related to any such termination and (ii) (x) any and all expenses arising from
or related to any such termination under WARN and any similar state or local
law or ordinance shall be excluded from the calculations of Earn-Out EBITDA,
and (y) any and all Liabilities arising from or related to any such
termination under WARN and any similar state or local law or ordinance shall
be excluded from the calculations of Indebtedness Amount and Net Working
Capital.

(j) No provision of this _Section 6.16_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any Plan, any benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement or the
terms of any sub agreements or sub plans, terms and conditions, restrictive
covenants, or participation requirements thereof, except and to the extent
such amendment is explicitly contemplated by the express language of this
Agreement; (ii) shall, following the second anniversary of the Effective Time,
limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and any of its Subsidiaries) to
amend, modify, or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement, or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored, or maintained by any
of them; (iii) is intended to confer upon any current or former employee
(including any Continuing Employee) or any other Person any right to
employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of
this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment;
or (iv) is intended to confer upon any Continuing Employee any rights or
remedies under this _Section 6.16_, including the right to enforce any
obligations of Parent or the Surviving Entity contained in this _Section
6.16_ as a third party beneficiary.

 



109  Section 6.17. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
the Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be required (to the
extent permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company
Common Units or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including, in each case,
derivative securities) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.18. _Equity and Other Long-Term Incentive Compensation_.

 

(a) It is the intent of the parties hereto that the aggregate magnitude of the
long-term incentive awards described in this  _Section 6.18_, whether in
stock-based or cash-based form, shall result in aggregate compensation expense
(excluding any compensation expense attributable to any stock-based or cash-
based awards granted to Robert Margolis, M.D.) of approximately $40,000,000,
to be expensed over the applicable vesting period(s).

(b) If Parent provides written notice no later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall grant Stock-Based Awards under
the Company Plan to the groups of Continuing Employees and in the amounts and
subject to the terms and conditions to be set forth on a schedule to be
mutually agreed upon in good faith between Parent and the Companys CEO as
soon as administratively practicable following the date of this Agreement,
_provided_ that such Stock-Based Awards shall be effective as of immediately
prior to, but contingent upon, the Effective Time. The number of Company
Common Units subject to each such Stock-Based Award shall be determined by
dividing (1) the quotient obtained by dividing the dollar amount set forth for
the recipient on the schedule described in this _Section 6.18(b)_ by an
amount equal to the product of the One Day Parent Stock Volume-Weighted
Average Price as of the date of grant and 52.0875% by (2) the Exchange Ratio.
If applicable, the per unit base or exercise price of such award shall be
determined by multiplying the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange on the Closing Date by the Exchange Ratio. Each Stock-
Based Award will be subject to the terms, definitions and provisions of the
Company Plan, with such amendments as Parent shall deem necessary or
appropriate and which will be effective solely with respect to the Stock-Based
Awards, and an applicable form of award agreement to be provided by Parent.
Parent will consult in good faith with the Companys CEO but will make the
final determination in its discretion as to the amendments that Parent deems
necessary or appropriate for the Company Plan and the intended assumption by
Parent of any Stock-Based Awards, _provided_ that such amendments shall not
adversely effect the intended economic benefits to be granted to Continuing
Employees pursuant to this _Section 6.18(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time,
and subject to the advance review and approval of Parent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Company shall have taken
all actions necessary to effect the grant of any Stock-Based Awards directed
by Parent to be made, including delivering all required notices, adopting
appropriate forms of award agreement for the Stock-Based Award (which shall
provide, among other things, for a vesting commencement date of no earlier
than the Effective Time, for no accelerated vesting as a result of the
Merger, and

 



110   that such Stock-Based Awards shall terminate in the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ hereof), authorizing the granting of the
type(s) of Stock-Based Awards contemplated in this _Section 6.18(b)_, and
obtaining any required consents and/or approvals necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 6.18(b)_ and which may otherwise be required
pursuant to applicable Law. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Parent obtains a
recommendation by ISS of a vote "for" the amendment to its 2011 Incentive
Award Plan described in Parents Proxy Statement for its 2012 Annual
Stockholder Meeting, Parent shall not direct the Company to grant, and the
Company shall not grant, any Stock-Based Awards.

 

(d) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than twenty-one (21) days
after the Closing Date, Parent agrees to grant cash-settled performance-based
long-term incentive plan awards to the groups of Continuing Employees and in
the amounts and subject to the terms and conditions to be set forth on a
schedule to be mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Companys CEO as soon
as administratively practicable following the date of this Agreement. In
addition, in the event that no Stock-Based Awards will be granted in
accordance with _Section 6.18(b)_, within twenty-one (21) days after the
Closing Date, Parent agrees to grant stock-based awards to the groups of
Continuing Employees and in the amounts and subject to the terms and
conditions to be set forth on a schedule to be mutually agreed upon by Parent
and the Companys CEO as soon as administratively practicable following the
date of this Agreement. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
each such stock-based award shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount
set forth for the recipient on the schedule described in this _Section
6.18(d)_ by an amount equal to the product of the One Day Parent Stock Volume-
Weighted Average Price as of the date of grant and 52.0875%. If applicable,
the per unit base or exercise price of such award shall be determined by the
closing price of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the
date of grant. Finally, with respect to the portion of the approximately
$40,000,000 of long-term incentive compensation expense referenced in 
_Section 6.18(a)_ above that remains after any grants of long-term incentive
awards are made either immediately prior to Closing in accordance with
_Section 6.18(b)_ or within twenty-one (21) days following the Closing
Date in accordance with this _Section 6.18(d)_, as soon as practicable, but
in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the one year anniversary
of the Closing Date, Parent agrees to grant stock-based awards to the groups
of Continuing Employees and in the amounts and subject to the terms and
conditions to be set forth on a schedule to be mutually agreed upon by Parent
and the Companys CEO as soon as administratively practicable following the
date of this Agreement.

(e) It is the intent of the parties that any long-term incentive awards for
any new employees of Parent, the Surviving Entity, or any of their Affiliates
will be mutually agreed upon in good faith between Parent and the Companys
CEO, consistent with appropriate corporate governance, including Parents
corporate policy on long-term incentive compensation. Parents CEO and the
Parent Board shall retain ultimate decision-making authority as it relates to
the corporate policy on long-term incentive compensation. Notwithstanding the
above, to the extent Parent recommends taking or opposing any action or
decision with respect to any long-term incentive awards for a new employee of
Parent, the Surviving Entity, or any of their Affiliates and the Companys CEO
is opposed to such Parent recommendation or decision, the Companys CEO has
the right to request that the Parent Board decide the issue, in which case the

 



111   matter shall be determined by the Parent Board (and no such taking or
opposing such action or decision shall be acted upon until such time as the
Parent Board approves such taking or opposing such action or decision after
considering in good faith the objections of the CEO).

Section 6.19. _Earn-Out EBITDA LTIP_. In the event that the Earn-Out EBITDA
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 is equal to or greater than
$600,000,000 or payment of the Second Tranche is accelerated pursuant to
_Section 3.06(e)_, then Parent shall, no later than the first date of
payment of the Second Tranche (including as such payment may be accelerated
pursuant to _Section 3.06(e)_), grant cash-settled performance-based long-
term incentive plan awards, totaling $20,000,000 in the aggregate, to the
groups of individuals and in the amounts and subject to the terms and
conditions to be set forth on a schedule to be mutually agreed upon by Parent
and the Companys CEO.

 

Section 6.20. _AMG Documents_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that (i) the transactions contemplated by the AMG Documents shall not be
effected or be otherwise deemed to have been consummated, or otherwise have
any effect on the Business Entities or the Related Entities, prior to the
Closing and (ii) Earn-Out EBITDA, EBITDA, Indebtedness, Indebtedness Amount,
and Net Working Capital shall be calculated as though the transactions
contemplated by the AMG Documents had never been agreed to or consummated.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the amount of the capital
contribution made by Seismic Medical Group, PC, a California professional
corporation, to HCPAMG in exchange for an interest therein pursuant to
Amendment No. 5 to the Second Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement of
HCPAMG corresponds to their understanding of the fair market value of such
interest and the aggregate net fair market value of the assets and liabilities
of HCPAMG.

are addressed in  _Section 8.02(d)_) or any of the EQ Representations;

(b) the breach of, or failure to perform, any covenant or agreement of the
Company (but only to the extent that any such covenant or agreement is to be

whistleblower with respect to any Business Entity or Related Entity, in all
cases computed net of all positive adjustments, including recoupments,
resulting from all such disclosures, investigations, actions, orders or
audits;

_provided_ , _however_ , that any indemnification obligation of the Members
under this _Section 8.02(c)_ that is attributable to the operation of the
Business (as measured by date of service) during the period from the Closing
Date until December 31, 2012, shall be prorated by multiplying the amount of
such Losses by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
2012 through the Closing Date and the denominator of which is 366; it further
being agreed, for the sake of clarity, that there shall be no proration or
reduction for any Losses attributable to the operation of the Business (as

Parent or any Affiliate of Parent, including, after the Closing, the Company
or any Affiliate of the Company, and that are not Indemnified Taxes subject
to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.02(d)_ (and for purposes of this
_Section 8.03(c)_, Losses shall include Taxes); and

 

(d) the execution of the AMG Documents and the transactions contemplated
thereby (and for purposes of this _Section 8.03(d)_, Losses shall include
Taxes other than Taxes resulting from a negative tax capital account
maintained by a partner of HCPAMG).

(without deduction of such threshold amount); (ii) no claim for
indemnification by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 8.02_
shall be asserted for any individual item or a series of related items where
the Losses with respect to such item or series of related items are less than

do not exceed $100,000, then no such Losses shall be counted toward
satisfaction of the threshold set forth in _Section 8.04(a)(i)_); (iii) the
maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from
the Members shall be an amount equal to the value, if any, of Parent Common
Stock and the amount, if any, of cash remaining in the Escrow Fund on or
prior to the Survival End Date and in the Healthcare Indemnity Account and the
Tax Indemnity Account following the Survival End Date (the " _Cap_ ") (it
being understood that the Members shall not be liable for Losses in the
aggregate in excess of the Cap); (iv) following the Survival End Date, the
only indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Members (and any
such recovery shall be limited by the Cap) shall be (A) from the Healthcare
Indemnity Account but only until the Fourth Escrow Distribution Date (except

following the Fourth Escrow Distribution Date, the only indemnifiable Losses
which may be recovered from the Healthcare Indemnity Account shall be for any
claim made by a Parent Indemnified Party on or prior to the Fourth Escrow
Distribution Date in accordance with _Section 8.05_ and of the type described
in  _Section 8.04(a)(iv)(A)(x)_ or _Section 8.04(a)(iv)(A)(y)_, in each
case that remains unresolved as of the Fourth Escrow Distribution Date; (vi)
following the Fifth Escrow Distribution Date, the only indemnifiable
Losses which may be recovered from the Tax Indemnity Account shall be for any
claim made by a Parent Indemnified Party on or prior to the Fifth Escrow

out of, resulting from, or accelerated by, the breach of any covenant herein
by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent,

 



118   including, after the Closing, the Company or any Affiliate of the Company,
and (viii) the Members shall not be liable for any Losses to the extent
arising out of or resulting from the execution of the AMG Documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby (it being understood that, for the avoidance
of doubt, this clause (viii) shall not require Parent to indemnify any Member
that is also a partner of HCPAMG for Taxes resulting from a negative tax
capital account maintained by such partner in HCPAMG, as provided in _Section
8.03(d)_ above); _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth in
this _Section 8.04(a)_ shall not apply in respect of any indemnification
obligation arising out of or resulting from fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by the Company (to the extent occurring prior to the
Closing) or any Member (it being understood that any such
indemnification obligation may only be recovered from the Escrow Fund if a
claim is made with respect thereto on or prior to the Survival End Date in
accordance with _Section 8.05_ and may not be recovered from the Healthcare
Indemnity Account or the Tax Indemnity Account) and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the limitations set forth in clause (i) of this _Section 8.04(a)_ shall
not apply to breaches by the Company of any of the Specified Reps.

 

(b) (i) Parent shall not be liable for any Losses pursuant to _Section
8.03(a)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which
may be recovered from Parent exceeds $5,008,380, whereupon the Company
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for the full amount of
such Losses (without deduction of such threshold amount); (ii) no claim for
indemnification by any Company Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
8.03(a)_ or _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be asserted for any individual item or a
series of related items where the Losses with respect to such item or series
of related items are less than $100,000 (and if the Losses relating to such
item or series of related items do not exceed $100,000, then no such Losses
shall be counted toward satisfaction of the threshold set forth in  _Section
8.04(b)(i))_; (iii) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which
may be recovered from Parent under _Section 8.03(a)_ and _Section 8.03(c)_
shall be an amount equal to $101,875,000 (it being understood that Parent
shall not be liable for Losses in the aggregate in excess of $101,875,000
pursuant to this clause (iii)); and (iv) Parent shall not be liable for any
Losses pursuant to _Section 8.03(c)_ or  _Section 8.03(d)_ to the extent
arising out of, resulting from, or accelerated by, the breach of any covenant
herein by any Member or, prior to the Closing, by the Company or any Affiliate
of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth in
this _Section 8.04(b)_ shall not apply in respect of any indemnification
obligation arising out of or resulting from fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by Parent or Merger Sub, or by the Company (to the extent
occurring after the Closing), and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
limitations set forth in clause (i) of this _Section 8.04(b)_ shall not apply
to breaches by Parent or Merger Sub of any of the Specified Reps. 

(c) The Members liability for any Losses shall be satisfied solely and
exclusively from the Escrowed Merger Consideration then held by the Escrow
Agent in the Escrow Account on or prior to the Survival End Date (the "
_Escrow Fund_ ") or in the Healthcare Indemnity Account and in the Tax
Indemnity Account after the Survival End Date by reducing the amounts that
would otherwise become payable to the Members under the Escrow Agreement, and
in no event shall any such Losses other than from Escrowed Merger
Consideration in the Escrow Account, the Healthcare Indemnity Account and
the Tax Indemnity Account be payable by the Members through application of
_Section 10.10_. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, the
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that once Escrowed Merger Consideration
in the Escrow Account, the Healthcare Indemnity Account and the Tax Indemnity

 



119   Account has been exhausted or fully paid to the Members and the holders of
Company Options, the only liability of the Members for Losses hereunder that
shall survive shall be with respect to breaches of any of the Specified Reps
arising out of or resulting from fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the
Company (to the extent occurring prior to the Closing) or any Member, which
liability shall be several and not joint among the Members and shall be
allocated pro rata based on the Fully Diluted Units held by such Members as of
immediately prior to the Closing relative to Total Outstanding Company Units.

 

(d) For all purposes of this _ARTICLE VIII_ , the representations and
warranties of the Company shall not be deemed to be qualified by any
references to the terms "material", "materially", "Material Adverse Effect" or
terms of similar meaning; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event shall (A)
"Material Contract" be read to mean "Contract" or (B) any such "material",
"materially" or "Material Adverse Effect" be read out of _Section 4.12_ or
_Section 4.22(a)_. For all purposes of this _ARTICLE VIII_ , "Losses" shall
be net of (A) any insurance proceeds actually paid to the Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification and, if the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
receives such proceeds after receipt of payment from the Indemnifying Party,
then the amount of such proceeds, net of any related deductibles and
reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining them, shall be paid to the
Indemnifying Party; (B) any prior or subsequent contribution or other
payments or recoveries of a like nature by the Indemnified Party from any
third Person (other than the Indemnifying Party) with respect to such Losses;
and (C) any amount reserved on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet or, on and
after such time there exists a balance sheet from which Final Net Working
Capital and Final Indebtedness Amount are calculated, such balance sheet with
respect to such Loss to the extent that such amount was included in Final Net
Working Capital or Final Indebtedness Amount. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees to treat any payment for any indemnification claim
pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the consideration
received hereunder by the applicable holder of Company Common Units for such
Company Common Units or by the applicable holder of Company Options for such
Company Options. Each Indemnified Party shall be obligated to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses after it becomes aware
of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

 

(e) (i) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any Losses in respect of any
liability or Loss that is contingent unless and until such contingent
liability or Loss becomes an actual liability or Loss and is due and payable
and (ii) no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to pay any amount in discharge
of a claim under this _ARTICLE VIII_ unless and until the Liability or Loss
in respect of which the claim is made has become due and payable.

(f) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled under this Agreement to
multiple recoveries for the same Loss.

(g) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under
this _ARTICLE VIII_ with respect to any Losses to the extent that such Losses
have been incorporated into the final determination of the "Final Net Working
Capital" or the "Final Indebtedness Amount" pursuant to  _Section 3.05_ and
Parent has been paid the Total Shortfall Amount, if any, to which it is
entitled pursuant to such Section.

 



120  (h) The right of a Parent Indemnified Party or a Company Indemnified Party
to indemnification or to assert or recover on any claim shall not be affected
by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy of or compliance with any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements set forth in this Agreement. The waiver of any
condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement, shall not affect
the right to indemnification or other remedy based on such representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements.

 

(i) Parent may offset any amounts to which it may be entitled under the terms
of this Agreement against amounts otherwise payable by it under this
Agreement. Neither the exercise of, nor the failure to exercise, such right of
offset shall constitute an election of remedies or limit Parent in any manner
in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it hereby. 

(j) Any Loss incurred by a Parent Indemnified Party to the extent due to its
or the Companys or a Related Consolidated Entitys direct or indirect
ownership of equity securities of a less than wholly owned Related Entity
shall be limited to the Losses attributable to such Parent Indemnified Partys
or the Companys or such Related Consolidated Entitys ownership interest and
shall not include any Losses incurred to the extent due to any other ownership
interest of equity securities in such Related Entity.

Section 8.05. _Notice of Loss; Third-Party Claims_.

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice of
any matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give
rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within forty-five
(45) days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known,
and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide
such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this _ARTICLE VIII_ except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

 

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, claim,
demand, or assessment against it (each, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that may
give rise to a claim for Loss under this _ARTICLE VIII_ , within thirty (30)
days of the receipt of such notice (or within such shorter period as may be
required to permit the Indemnifying Party to respond to any such claim), the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice of such
Third-Party Claim together with copies of all notices and documents served on
or received by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
failure to provide such notice or copies shall not release the Indemnifying
Party from any of its obligations under this _ARTICLE VIII_ except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.
The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of
such Third-Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice (
_provided_ that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified
Party) if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ that, if the

 



121   Third-Party Claim consists of an Action brought against or with respect to
the Indemnified Party by a Governmental Authority enforcing, or asserting
Losses as a result of a violation of, Health Care Laws, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled, by giving written notice to the Indemnifying Party
concurrently with the giving of written notice of such Third-Party Claim, to
elect to jointly assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim
with the Indemnifying Party, with each of the Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party bearing one-half of the expense of such defense and through
counsel jointly selected by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake any such defense (other than a
joint defense as described above) against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys
expense (other than in the case of a joint defense as described above where
such expense shall be split equally), all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials, and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the
Indemnified Partys control relating thereto (or in the possession or control
of any of its Affiliates or its or their Representatives) as is reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party or its counsel. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to direct the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to this
_Section 8.05_, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or approve the payment
of any part of such Third-Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents
in writing to such payment or unless the Indemnifying Party withdraws from the
defense of such Third-Party Claim or unless a final judgment from which no
appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is entered
against the Indemnified Party for such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party has elected to direct and is directing the defense of any Third-Party
Claim pursuant to this _Section 8.05_, the Indemnified Party shall not forgo
any appeal or admit any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise, or
discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior
written consent. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle any
Third-Party Claim for which it obtains a full release of the Indemnified Party
in respect of such Third-Party Claim (and which settlement does not impose
injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or a
finding or admission of any violation of applicable Law or violation of the
rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party) or to which settlement the
Indemnified Party consents in writing, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

Section 8.06. _Remedies_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that following the Closing, other than as provided in _Section 10.10_ (but
subject to _Section 8.04(c)_), (i) the indemnification provisions of this
_ARTICLE VIII_ and _Section 6.08(c)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the parties hereto for any breach of the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or of the EQ Representations and for
any failure to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement in
this Agreement; and (ii) any and all claims arising out of or in connection
with the Transactions must be brought under and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby
waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any and all other rights, claims, and causes of action it may have against the
other party or its Affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement (other than claims for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation).

 



122  Section 8.07. _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party
for any indemnification claim pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any
rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any third-parties with
respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 8.08. _Member Representative_.

(a) Each Member shall be deemed to have irrevocably approved the designation
of, and hereby irrevocably designates, Robert D. Mosher as the Member
Representative and Robert D. Mosher is hereby appointed as of the date hereof
as the true and lawful agent and attorney in fact of the Members as the Member
Representative for and on behalf of the Members to give and receive notices
and communications in connection with this Agreement and related matters,
including in connection with claims for indemnification under this _ARTICLE
VIII_ , to take all actions, including the payment of expenses or defense on
behalf of Members pursuant to _Section 8.05_, and to agree to,
negotiate, defend, and enter into settlements, adjustments, and compromises
of, and commence and prosecute litigation and comply with Governmental Orders
with respect to, such claims, and to take all other actions, including the
giving of instructions to the Escrow Agent, that are either (i) necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Member Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically authorized or mandated by
_Section 3.02_,  _Section 3.05_, _Section 3.06_, _Section 3.07_, _Section
3.08_, _Section 6.15_, _Section 7.01_, _Section 7.02_, and _Section 8.08_
and _ARTICLE X_. In fulfilling his duties hereunder, the Member
Representative shall act in good faith and in a manner that the Member
Representative reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Members,
taken as a whole, and consistent with his obligations under this Agreement.
The Member Representative shall be assisted from time to time by such Persons
as the Member Representative deems necessary and appropriate in exercising his
duties under this Agreement. The Member Representative shall be subject
to removal by the Majority Member (or its designated successor). If the
Member Representative shall die, be removed, become disabled or resign, or the
Member Representative is otherwise unable to fulfill his responsibilities
hereunder, the Majority Member shall appoint a successor Member
Representative as soon as reasonably practicable after such death, removal,
disability, resignation, or inability, and immediately thereafter notify
Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed
the former Member Representative as the Member Representative hereunder.
Notices or communications to or from the Member Representative shall
constitute notice to or from the Members. Each Member hereby agrees to receive
correspondence from the Member Representative, including in electronic form.
As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the Company
shall deliver to the Member Representative a mailing list with the mailing
address and email address of each Member and holder of Company Options and
the Member Representative may rely on such mailing list unless notified in
writing by any Member, holder of Company Options, or any authorized
representative of any Member or holder of Company Options of a change in such
Members or holder of Company Options mailing address or email address or of
a transfer pursuant to _Section 3.07_, indentifying (in the case of a
transfer) the name and address of the successor interest holder. It is
understood by all parties that Robert D. Mosher is executing this Agreement
solely in his capacity as the Member Representative and solely with respect to
the specified provisions of this Agreement specified in the first sentence of
this clause (a), and the Member Representative shall have no duties or
obligations, at law, in equity, by contract, or otherwise, to act on behalf of
any Member, except for those duties or obligations expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

 



123  (b) Any and all costs and expenses of the Member Representative, including any
costs and expenses of any Person retained by the Member Representative to
provide assistance, counsel, or other advisory services, incurred in
performing his obligations under this Agreement shall be paid or recovered
from funds in the MR Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 3.07_, except as
provided in the last sentence of _Section 8.08(c)_.

(c) The Member Representative shall be entitled to act in his sole and
absolute discretion and shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Members for
any act done or omitted hereunder as the Member Representative, including
errors in judgment, while acting in good faith or in reliance on the advice
of representatives of the Majority Member, counsel, accountants, or other
advisors, consultants, or experts. The Members shall exonerate and make no
claim against the Member Representative for acting as their Member
Representative, other than with respect to any act or failure to act which
represents fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence on the part of the
Member Representative. The Members shall indemnify the Member Representative
and hold the Member Representative harmless against any liability incurred
without fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence on the part of the
Member Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of the Member Representatives duties hereunder, including
the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Member
Representative. The Member Representative shall have the right to recover such
expenses directly from the MR Escrow Account; _provided_ , _however_ ,
following the time that the MR Escrow Account has been fully exhausted, the
Member Representative may recover 80% of such expenses from the Majority
Member and 20% of such expenses from Bay Shores Investment LLC, with such
Members being entitled to recover the payment of such expenses in excess of
their pro rata share from the other Members pro rata based on the proportion
of Company Common Units held by each Member as of immediately prior to
the Closing relative to all Company Common Units held by all Members as of
immediately prior to the Closing. The Majority Member, Bay Shores Investment
LLC, and each Signing Member shall promptly make the payments required of them
hereunder and shall pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred in any Action initiated to collect any such payments
that have not been made.

(d) The Member Representative shall be compensated for his service as such
based upon the amount of time devoted to such services at the normal hourly
rate of the Member Representative as determined by Nossaman LLP. If the
Member Representative is not a lawyer at Nossaman LLP, the Member
Representative shall be compensated at a rate and on a basis established by
the Majority Member. The Member Representative shall be paid such compensation
from the funds in the MR Escrow Account and, if there are no remaining funds
in the MR Escrow Account, the Member Representative may recover his
compensation in the same way expenses may be recovered pursuant to the last
sentence of  _Section 8.08(c)_ above.

(e) A decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Member Representative
after the Closing, including a waiver of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.08(b)_ hereof, shall constitute a decision of all the Members and shall be
final, binding, and conclusive upon the Members. Parent is entitled to rely
upon any such decision, act, consent, or instruction of the

 



124   Member Representative as being the decision, act, consent, or instruction of
all the Members. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person
for any acts done by Parent in accordance with such decision, act, consent,
or instruction of the Member Representative.

(f) Parent agrees and acknowledges that concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, it has executed and delivered to the Member Representative a
conflict waiver letter mutually agreeable to Parent and the Member
Representative. The Members acknowledge that the Member Representative is a
partner in a law firm, Nossaman LLP, which as of the date hereof provides
legal services to the Company and after the Closing may provide legal services
to or on behalf of Parent and its Affiliates, including the Surviving Entity.
The Company with respect to periods prior to Closing and the Members
acknowledge and waive any conflict of interest that may result from the
representation of Parent and its Affiliates by Nossaman LLP or Mr. Mosher at a
time when Mr. Mosher concurrently serves as the Member Representative.

TERMINATION

 

Section 9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by either the Company or Parent if the Closing shall not have occurred by
November 30, 2012 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.01(a)_ shall not
be available to any party whose breach or failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in,
the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

(b) by either the Company or Parent in the event that any Governmental Order
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions shall have become final
and nonappealable;

(c) by the Company if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement
(including an obligation to consummate the Transactions) shall have occurred
that would, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ not to be satisfied, and such breach
is not cured, or is incapable of being cured, within thirty (30) days (but no
later than the Termination Date) of receipt of written notice by the Company
to Parent of such breach; _provided_ that the Company is not then in breach of
this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.02_ not to be satisfied;

(d) by Parent if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
(including an obligation to consummate the Transactions) shall have occurred
that would, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, cause any of the
conditions set forth in  _Section 7.02_ not to be satisfied, and such breach
is not cured, or is incapable of being cured, within thirty (30) days (but no
later than the Termination Date) of receipt of written notice by Parent to the
Company of such breach;  _provided_ that Parent is not then in breach of this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_
not to be satisfied;

 



125  (e) by either the Company or Parent, upon written notice to the other party,
if the Member Approval shall not have been obtained;

(f) by either the Company or Parent in the event that one or more of the
conditions to Closing contained in _ARTICLE VII_ cannot be satisfied as of
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 9.01(f)_ shall not be available to any party in
breach of this Agreement or whose failure to fulfill any obligation under
this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, such
condition not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date;

 

(g) by either the Company or Parent in the event that neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall have received the proceeds of the Financing at any time
following the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.02_ (other than those conditions that, by their nature, cannot be
satisfied until the Closing Date, but which conditions could be satisfied if
the Closing Date were the date of such termination); _provided_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.01(g)_ shall not be
available to any party in breach of this Agreement or whose failure to fulfill
any obligation under _Section 6.08_ shall have been the cause of, or shall
have resulted in, such failure of Parent or Merger Sub to receive the proceeds
of the Financing;

 

(h) by Parent, upon written notice to the Company within five (5) Business
Days after obtaining the Member Approval, if at the time of termination
holders of more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding Company Common Units
shall have validly exercised their dissent rights (and not withdrawn such
exercise or otherwise become ineligible to effect such exercise) in
respect of the Transactions; or

(i) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent.

 

Section 9.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 9.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no Liability on the part of either party hereto
or its Representatives (which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Financing Sources) except that (a) this  _Section 9.02_, _Section 9.03_,
_ARTICLE X_ , the indemnification provisions set forth in _Section 6.08(c)_
and the reimbursement provisions set forth in _Section 6.16(a)_ shall survive
any such termination; (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms; and (c) nothing herein
shall relieve any party hereto from Liability for any intentional breach of
this Agreement occurring prior to such termination.

Section 9.03. _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that (i) Parent or the Company shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)_ (and at such time any condition set forth in
_Section 7.01(a)_ or _Section 7.01(g)_ is not satisfied, including the
obligation of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions, or any
other condition set forth in  _Section 7.01_ is not met due to Parents or
Merger Subs breach of this Agreement or failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement) or the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.01(c)_, in either case following the satisfaction or waiver of
all the conditions set forth in _Section 7.02_ (other than (x) conditions
that have not been met due to Parents or Merger Subs breach of this
Agreement or 

 



126   failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement and (y) those
conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
but, in the case of clause (y), which conditions could be satisfied if the
Closing Date were the date of such termination or if Parent or Merger Sub had
not breached this Agreement or had not failed to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement), (ii) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(f)_ following Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement
or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement, in each case that
shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, a condition not to
be satisfied as of the Closing Date that provided the basis for the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(f)_, or (iii) Parent
or the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.01(g)_
(other than if (A) the Company has failed to deliver to Parent on the Closing
Date a certificate signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company
certifying that, effective as of the Closing, the EQ Representations with
respect to which the Company, pursuant to _Section 6.08(c)_, has confirmed to
Parent that Parent may make in the Financing Agreement with respect to the
Senior Secured Financing are true and correct in all material respects as of
the Closing Date and (B) neither Parent nor Merger Sub has received the
proceeds of the Senior Secured Financing and that failure is solely the result
of the EQ Representations not being true and correct in all material respects
as of the Closing Date), then Parent shall pay to the Company, (x)
concurrently with such termination by Parent or (y) for all such terminations
other than by Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event,
within two (2) Business Days of such termination) a termination fee of
$125,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), it being
understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(b) If the Parent Termination Fee becomes due and Parent fails to timely pay
such termination fee, and, in order to obtain payment, the Company commences
an Action that results in a judgment against Parent for the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee, Parent shall, in addition to paying the Company the
Parent Termination Fee, pay the Company its reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with the such Action,
together with interest on such termination fee at the prime rate, as quoted in
the "Money Rates" section of _The Wall Street Journal_ , for the period
commencing on the date the Parent Termination Fee was required to be paid
through the date such payment was actually received by the Company.

Section 10.03. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, nor any Business Entity or Related Entity, on the other
hand, shall make, or cause to be made, any press release or
public announcement in respect of this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents, or the Transactions or otherwise communicate with any news media
regarding this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, or the Transactions
without the prior written consent of the other party hereto unless such press
release or public announcement is otherwise required by Law or applicable
stock exchange regulation, in which case Parent and the Company shall, to the
extent practicable and lawful, consult with each other and cooperate as to
the timing and contents of any such press release, public announcement, or
communication. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Business Entities and the Related Entities, on the other hand,
may make, or cause to be made, public statements in respect of this Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents, or the Transactions or otherwise communicate
with any news media regarding this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents, or the Transactions without the prior written consent of the other
party hereto so long as such statements or communications are consistent with
press releases, public announcements, or other communications previously
approved by the parties. 

Section 10.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under any Law
or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, _provided_ that the economic and
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 10.05. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents, the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



129  Section 10.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation
of Law or otherwise without the express written consent of the Company and
Parent (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the
Company or Parent), as the case may be, and any attempted assignment without
such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall have the right to assign this Agreement to a direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such assignment
shall not relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder.

Section 10.07. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, each of
the parties hereto; or (b) by a waiver in accordance with _Section 10.08_.

Section 10.08. _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other
party; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
any other party contained herein or in any document delivered by any other
party pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of any other party or conditions to such obligations contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any party hereto in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise
of any other right hereunder. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of
its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

Section 10.09. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit, or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , (a) the Members and holders of Company
Options are express third party beneficiaries of _ARTICLE III_ , _Section
6.12_, _Section 6.13_, _Section 6.15(b)_, _ARTICLE VIII_ , and this _Section
10.09_ and (b) the Financing Sources are express third party beneficiaries of
_Section 9.02_, this _Section 10.09_, _Section 10.11_, _Section 10.12_ and
_Section 10.14_.

Section 10.10. _Specific Performance_. Subject to _Section 8.04(c)_, each of
the parties hereto acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach by any
party of any of their obligations under this Agreement (including failing to
take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
Transactions) would give rise to irreparable harm to the other parties to this
Agreement (in each instance, a " _Non-Breaching Party_ ") for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy and hereby agrees that in the event of
a breach or a threatened breach by a party of any such obligations, any Non-
Breaching Party shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies
that may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to
equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction,
specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from a court
of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to

 



130   post bond or other security). Each of the parties hereto agrees that such
party will not oppose the granting of a temporary restraining order, an
injunction, specific performance, or any other equitable relief on the basis
that there is an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Company and the Member Representative shall
not have the right under this _Section 10.10_ to obtain a temporary
restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, or any other equitable
relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction to cause
the consummation of the Closing if (i) Parent has complied with its
obligations under _Section 6.08_, (ii) despite such compliance, the proceeds
of the Financing are not available to Parent or Merger Sub, and (iii)
upon termination of this Agreement, the Parent Termination Fee shall be due
and payable in accordance with _Section 9.03_.

 

Section 10.11. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. All Actions
arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any Action involving
the Financing Sources) shall be heard and determined exclusively in any
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such federal court does not have jurisdiction
over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any
New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New
York. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the parties hereto hereby (a)
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York for the purpose of any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto
(including any Action involving the Financing Sources); (b) consent to service
of process in accordance with the procedure set forth in _Section 10.02_; and
(c) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts.

 

Section 10.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING ANY ACTION INVOLVING THE FINANCING SOURCES). EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER; AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.12_.

 

Section 10.13. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission, such as by
electronic mail in "pdf" form) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

 



131  Section 10.14. _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company agrees on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries that it shall not assert any claim or bring any action, or
support any claim or action brought by another Person (whether in equity, in
contract or tort, or otherwise), in any proceeding or forum, against any
Financing Source or any former, current, or future stockholder, controlling
person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member,
manager, Affiliate, agent, or advisor thereof (excluding, in each case,
Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Affiliates) relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Financing Letters or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including any action or claim arising out of
or relating to any breach, termination, or failure under this Agreement, and
no Financing Source or any former, current, or future stockholder, controlling
person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member,
manager, Affiliate, agent, or advisor thereof (excluding, in each case,
Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Affiliates) shall have any liability
or obligation to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Financing Letters or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including any action or claim arising out of
or relating to any breach, termination, or failure under this Agreement.
