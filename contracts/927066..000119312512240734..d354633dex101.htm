approve the payment of any part of such Third-Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment or unless the Indemnifying Party withdraws from the defense of such Third-Party Claim or unless a final judgment from which
no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has elected to direct and is directing the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to
this <U>Section&nbsp;8.05</U>, the Indemnified Party shall not forgo any appeal or admit any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise, or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party&#146;s prior written consent. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim for which it obtains a full release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third-Party Claim (and which settlement does not impose injunctive or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party or a finding or admission of any violation of applicable Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party) or to which settlement the Indemnified Party consents in writing, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Section 8.06. <U>Remedies</U>. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
