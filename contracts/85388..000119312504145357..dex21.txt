                        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 19, 2004 (this
"Agreement"), by and among General Growth Properties, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Red Acquisition, LLC, a Maryland limited liability
company and a subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and The Rouse Company, a
Maryland corporation (the "Company").

          WHEREAS, (i) the board of directors of the Company has approved
this Agreement and declared advisable the merger (the "Merger") of Merger
Sub with and into the Company in accordance with the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the "MGCL") and the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act
(the "MLLCA") and the sole member of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement
and declared the Merger advisable in accordance with the MGCL and the
MLLCA, and each desires to provide herein for the Merger, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii) the board of directors
of Parent has approved this Agreement and declared advisable the Merger,
and (iii) the board of directors of the Company has resolved to recommend
the approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

                                 ARTICLE I

                                 THE MERGER

          SECTION 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the MGCL and the MLLCA,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate legal existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

          SECTION 1.2 Closing; Effective Time. Subject to the provisions
of Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
at the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP, One New
York Plaza, New York, New York, as soon as practicable, but in no event
later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that can
only be fulfilled at the Effective Time, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions), or at such other place or at such other date
as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date". At the
Closing, the parties hereto shall cause articles of merger ("Articles of
Merger") to be filed with, delivered in the manner required by the MGCL and
the MLLCA to and accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments
and Taxation of Maryland (the "Department") (the date and time of the
acceptance for record of the Articles of Merger with the Department, or
such later time as is specified in the Articles of Merger and as is agreed
to by the parties hereto, being the "Effective Time") and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the MGCL and the MLLCA in
connection with the Merger.

          SECTION 1.3 Effects of the Merger. From and after the Effective
Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the MGCL and the MLLCA. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities, duties
and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Corporation.

          SECTION 1.4 Charter; Bylaws. From and after the Effective Time,
the charter of the Company shall be the charter of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and
applicable law. From and after the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the
Company shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with their terms, the charter of the Surviving
Corporation and applicable law.

          SECTION 1.5 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective
Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualify, and the
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or the date their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed (as the case may be) and qualify.

                                 ARTICLE II

                 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK
                      OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

          SECTION 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the stock of the Company:

               (a) Merger Consideration.
                   ---------------------

                    (i) Subject to Section 2.1(c), each issued and
outstanding share of Company common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Company Common Stock"), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent $67.50 in
cash, without interest, minus the amount, if any, of the Dividend
Adjustment (the "Merger Consideration"). "Dividend Adjustment" shall mean
the sum of (i) the lesser of (x) $2.42 and (y) the amount per share of
Company Common Stock of any dividend declared by the Company, if any, after
the date hereof and having a record date prior to the Effective Time other
than as permitted by Section 6.11(a)(ii) or 6.11(b) (the amount of any
dividend described in this clause (y), an "Excess Dividend") and (ii) the
product of 1.1 and the amount of any Excess Dividend over $2.42.

                    (ii) As of the Effective Time, subject to Section
2.1(c), all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
"Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.

                    (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger
Consideration and any other relevant provisions of this Agreement shall be
equitably adjusted.

               (b) Membership Interests of Merger Sub. The issued and
outstanding membership interests of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

               (c) Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Merger Sub-Owned Stock.
As of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is owned by Parent or
Merger Sub (or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

          SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to
the Closing, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for
payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates.
Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, the amount of cash
consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund may not be used for
any purpose that is not provided for herein.

               (b) Payment Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Certificates whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a),
(i) a letter of transmittal and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into
which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to
Section 2.1(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may
be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate,
the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(a). No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

               (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II
upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made
by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled as provided in this Article II.

               (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common
Stock for nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent
and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon.

               (e) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental authority), any such cash in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

               (f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall
invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund on a daily basis, as directed
by Parent, in direct obligations of the United States of America,
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest
or commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's or a combination
thereof, provided that, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding three months. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes
for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payments of
the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore the cash portion of the Exchange Fund lost through
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at
all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

          SECTION 2.3 Treatment of Company Options and Phantom Stock
                      Rights.
                      ----------------------------------------------

               (a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option which is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, as soon as
practicable thereafter, an amount of cash from the Surviving Corporation
equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess of the
amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
subject to such Company Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment
to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent).

               (b) Each Phantom Stock Right that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be adjusted to provide that
such Phantom Stock Right shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time, and,
in consideration of such cancellation, the holder thereof shall become
entitled to receive for each Phantom Stock Right an amount of cash from the
Surviving Corporation equal to the Merger Consideration; provided, that no
such payment shall be made to such a holder with respect to a Phantom Stock
Right if the holder has elected to defer payment thereof to a deferred
compensation account under a Company Plan, and, in lieu thereof, such
account shall be credited with a fully vested amount of cash equal to such
payment.

               (c) The Company shall take all steps necessary to give
effect to this Section 2.3. Any cash payments required to be made pursuant
to this Section 2.3, and any cash payment in respect of Stock Awards, shall
be subject to all applicable withholdings of Taxes.

                                ARTICLE III

               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as of the date of this Agreement (except in the case of any
representation or warranty that by its express terms is made as of another
specified date) that, except as set forth on the corresponding section of
the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"):

          SECTION 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The
Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization
and has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where any such failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing or to have such power or authority would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the management of properties
for others or the conduct of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for any such failure to be so qualified or
licensed or in good standing which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. "Company Material
Adverse Effect" means (x) any change or effect that has been or would be
materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than
any change or effect resulting from (i) changes in general international,
national or regional economic or financial conditions, or changes in the
securities market in general, (ii) general changes or developments in the
industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate or (iii)
changes in any laws or regulations or accounting regulations or principles
applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, or (y) any change or effect
that would prevent or materially delay the ability of the Company to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          SECTION 3.2 Charter and Bylaws. The Company has heretofore
furnished or otherwise provided to Parent a complete and correct copy of

subsidiaries of, or made a claim against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries with respect to, any breach or default thereunder, in any such
case, where such breach or default would, individually or in the aggregate,

parties thereto, except as would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, the material Contracts are valid, binding and enforceable

any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the persons listed therein,
on the other hand, pursuant to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such persons, on the other hand, have
any continuing obligations.

          SECTION 3.21 Properties. The Company or a subsidiary of the
Company (each a "Company Property Owner") owns fee simple title to each of
the real properties (or the applicable portion thereof) described in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2003 as being owned in fee, as adjusted to reflect purchases and sales

each of the real properties subject to a lease described in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, as
adjusted to reflect purchases and sales disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports prior to the date hereof (collectively, the "Leased Properties").
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the interests of the Company Property Owners in
the Company Properties and the Leased Properties are good, marketable and
insurable, and the same are owned free and clear of Encumbrances except for

interests or other encumbrances on title (collectively, "Encumbrances")
related to indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business, (ii)
inchoate Encumbrances imposed for construction work in progress, including
mechanics' liens, workers' or repairmen's liens, or otherwise incurred in

which reserves in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices
have been set forth on the books of the relevant Company Property Owner),
(vi) leases or other occupancy agreements affecting a Company Property and
(vii) other Encumbrances that would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No written termination of or notice of default has been received by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries under a ground lease relating to the
Lease Properties, except as would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, valid policies of title insurance have been issued
insuring the Company Property Owner's fee simple title or leasehold estate
to each of the Company Properties, and no material claim has been made
against any such policies.

          SECTION 3.22 Non-Competition Agreements. Except with respect to
single purpose entities which are restricted as such under terms of their
organizational documents or financings applicable to them, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any Contract which
purports to restrict or prohibit in any material respect any of them from,
directly or indirectly, (a) engaging in any business currently engaged in
by the Company or (b) conducting any business currently engaged in by the
Company in any geographic location, except those non-material restrictions
contained in the reciprocal easement agreements in respect of the Company

businesses similar to that of the Company and its subsidiaries (taking into
account the cost and availability of such insurance). Neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of cancellation or
termination with respect to any insurance policy of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries. Each insurance policy that currently insures the
business, property, operations, employees or officers of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries is in full force and effect and the premiums due
thereunder have been paid as they became due and payable.

          SECTION 3.24 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in this Article III, each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other
person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or with respect to
any other information provided to Parent or Merger Sub. Neither the Company
nor any other person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other person
resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub of, or Parent's or
Merger Sub's use of, any such information, including any information,
documents or other material made available to Parent or Merger Sub in
expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                ARTICLE IV

                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
                           PARENT AND MERGER SUB

          Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent
and warrant to the Company as of the date of this Agreement (except in the
case of any representation or warranty that by its express terms is made as
of another specified date) that, except as set forth on the corresponding
section of the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to
the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent
Disclosure Schedule"):

          SECTION 4.1 Organization and Qualification. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub, is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite
power and authority to own, operate or lease its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as it is now being or will be conducted, except
where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to
have such power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate,
prevent or materially delay or impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (a "Parent Material
Adverse Effect"). Parent and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business, and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
management of properties for others or the conduct of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except for any such failure to
be so qualified or licensed or in good standing which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding membership
interests of Merger Sub free and clear of all Liens.

          SECTION 4.2 Authority Relative to This Agreement. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by each
of Parent and Merger Sub of its obligations under this Agreement, and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
action and no other proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are
necessary pursuant to their respective organizational documents, the
Delaware General Corporation Law, the MGCL or the MLLCA to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the
Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each such
entity enforceable against such entity in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally, and general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The board of directors of
Parent (the "Parent Board") and Parent, as the sole member of Merger Sub,
have approved this Agreement. The vote or consent of Parent or a subsidiary
of Parent as the sole member of Merger Sub (which shall have occurred prior
to the Effective Time) is the only vote or consent of the stockholders of
Parent or the members of Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement or
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

          SECTION 4.3 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. (a) The
execution and delivery of, and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub
of its obligations under, this Agreement, do not and will not (i) conflict
with or violate the respective organizational documents of Parent or Merger
Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations
contemplated by subsection (b) below have been obtained and all filings
described in subsection (b) below have been made, conflict with or violate
any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to Parent
or Merger Sub or by which either of them or their respective properties are
bound or (iii) result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default
(or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) or result in the loss of a material benefit under, or give rise to
any right of termination, cancellation, material amendment or material
acceleration of, any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or
by which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties are
bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this subsection
(a), for any such conflict, violation, breach, default, loss, right or
other occurrence which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of
its obligations under this Agreement, and the consummation by Merger Sub of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by,
filing with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority,
except for (i) applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, and state
securities, takeover and "blue sky" laws, (ii) the filing with and the
acceptance for record by the Department of the Articles of Merger as
required by the MGCL and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which Parent is qualified to do business,
and (iii) any such consent, approval, authorization, permit, action, filing
or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.4 Compliance. Neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries is in violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment
or decree applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or by which its
or any of their respective properties are bound, except for any such
violation which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its subsidiaries have all permits,
licenses, authorizations, exemptions, orders, consents, approvals and
franchises from governmental and regulatory agencies required to conduct
their respective businesses as now being conducted, except for any such
permit, license, authorization, exemption, order, consent, approval or
franchise the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.5 SEC Filings; Financial Statements. (a) Parent has
filed or otherwise transmitted all forms, reports, statements,
certifications and other documents required to be filed with the SEC since
January 1, 2003 (collectively with the forms, reports, statements,
certifications and other documents required to be filed with the SEC
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the "Parent SEC Reports"), each
of which, as finally amended, has complied as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, each as in effect on the date so filed. None of the Parent
SEC Reports already filed contained, when filed as finally amended, nor
will any Parent SEC Reports filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement
contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to
state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

               (b) The audited consolidated financial statements of Parent
(including any notes related thereto) for the fiscal years ended December
31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 included in Parent's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 filed with the SEC have
been prepared, and, any audited consolidated financial statements of Parent
(including any related notes thereto) filed after the date of this
Agreement, will be prepared, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
present, and, if filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly
present, in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Parent and its subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in
stockholders' equity for the periods indicated. The unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Parent (including any related notes thereto)
included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent SEC Reports filed
with the SEC have been prepared, and, if filed after the date of this
Agreement, will be prepared, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
present, and, if filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly
present, in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its subsidiaries as of the date thereof and the consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (subject
to normal period-end adjustments that will not be material in amount or
effect).

               (c) The management of Parent has (x) implemented disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Parent by
others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation, to Parent's outside auditors and the audit committee of
the Parent Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely
to adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parent's internal control over financial reporting. A summary of any of
those disclosures made by management to Parent's auditors and audit
committee is set forth in Section 4.4(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

               (d) Since July 31, 2002, (x) neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the officers of Parent, any director,
officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Parent or any
of its subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (y) no
attorney representing Parent or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
to the Parent Board or any committee thereof or to any director or officer
of Parent.

          SECTION 4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except with
respect to factual developments disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed
on or after March 12, 2004 and prior to the date hereof (and excluding any
forward looking statements or other expressions of expectation, possibility
or risk disclosed in such Parent SEC Reports), since December 31, 2003,
Parent and its subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only
in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than according
to, the ordinary course of such businesses consistent with past practices
and there has not been any change, development, event or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 4.7 Absence of Litigation. There are no suits, claims,
actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its subsidiaries, other than
any such suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of their respective
properties or assets is or are subject to any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award which would, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, no
investigation or review, including with respect to any accounting or
disclosure practices of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any
malfeasance by any executive officer or director of Parent, by any
governmental authority, including the SEC, is pending or, to the knowledge
of Parent, has been threatened against Parent or any of its subsidiaries.

          SECTION 4.8 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment bank (other
than Lehman Brothers, Wachovia Bank and Credit Suisse First Boston) is
entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

          SECTION 4.9 Operations of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has been
organized as a Maryland limited liability company solely for the purposes
of effecting the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and
prior to the Effective Time Merger Sub will have engaged in no other
business activities and will have no material assets or liabilities other
than as contemplated herein.

          SECTION 4.10 Ownership of Shares of Company Common Stock. As of
the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
affiliates owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) any
shares of Company Common Stock, except for any shares of Company Common
Stock held by employee benefit plans of Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective affiliates, and none of Parent or Merger Sub or their respective
affiliates holds any rights to acquire any shares of Company Common Stock
except pursuant to this Agreement.

          SECTION 4.11 Financing. Parent has, in connection with entering
into this Agreement, delivered to the Company a complete and correct copy
of the commitment letters, dated August 19, 2004 relating to the debt
and/or equity financing necessary for the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which commitment
letters are in full force and effect (the "Commitment Letters"). It is
Parent's good faith belief as of the date hereof that it will obtain the
financing set forth in the Commitment Letters and that as a result it will
have available to it internal funds and third party financing that, in the
aggregate, will be sufficient to enable Parent and Merger Sub to make all
necessary payments by them in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any amounts
necessary to repay or refinance any outstanding indebtedness of the Company
and its subsidiaries to the extent such repayment or refinancing is
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

          SECTION 4.12 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, the
Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other person on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with
respect to any other information provided to the Company.

of any outstanding Company Option or other equity-based award; provided,
that the Company shall take all steps necessary so that actions taken
pursuant to exceptions to the restrictions set forth in this clause (m) do
not increase the amount of any severance benefits payable by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries;

               (n) add any new participants to the SERP or Excess Savings
Plan;

               (o) change the ownership of any of its subsidiaries or merge
or consolidate the Company or any of its subsidiaries with any other
person;

               (p) enter into, amend, or supplement any Tax Protection
Agreement;

               (q) make any changes with respect to accounting policies or
material procedures, except as required by changes in generally accepted
accounting principles or internal controls requirements to comply with
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;

               (r) settle any material litigation or other proceedings
before a governmental authority or arbitrator or cancel, modify or waive
material claims held by it or waive any material rights;

               (s) make or rescind any express or deemed material election
relative to Taxes, unless such election or rescission is (i) required by
law, (ii) necessary to preserve the status of the Company as a REIT or of
any subsidiary of the Company as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes or (iii) consistent with elections historically made by the
Company;

               (t) enter into, terminate or make any material amendment or
modification to any material Contract, including the CSA, except as
permitted by Section 5.1(g) or 5.1(l) of this Agreement or as disclosed in
Section 5.1(t) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;

               (u) take any action or omit to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to cause any of the Company's representations and
warranties contained in Article III to become untrue in any material
respect; provided, however, that the taking of any action required by this
Section 5.1 or the failure to take any action which is prohibited by this
Section 5.1 (which action Parent has not consented to after a request to
take such action by the Company or any of its Controlled Subsidiaries) by
the Company or any of its Controlled Subsidiaries shall not be deemed a
breach of this clause (u);

               (v) take any action, or fail to take any action, which can
reasonably be expected to cause (i) the Company to fail to qualify as a
REIT, or (ii) any of its subsidiaries to cease to be treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT, as a qualified REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code, or as a taxable REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code (except as a result of the
conversion of The Hughes Corporation into a limited liability company
pursuant to Section 7.2(f)), as the case may be; or

               (w) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

          SECTION 5.2 Conduct of Business of Parent Pending the Merger.
Parent covenants and agrees that, during the period from the date hereof
until the Effective Time, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement,
as disclosed in Section 5.2 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or as
required by law, or unless Company shall otherwise agree in writing,
neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries shall without the prior written
consent of Company take any action that would prevent or materially impede
the consummation of the Merger, including the obtaining of the financing
necessary for the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

          SECTION 5.3 Assistance. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Date or the date of the termination of this
Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries shall cooperate with Parent, at
the sole expense of Parent, in connection with Parent's planning for the
post-Closing integration of the business organizations of Parent and the
Company; provided, however, that neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall be required to engage in any transaction prior to the
Effective Time.

          SECTION 5.4 No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the Company's or its subsidiaries' operations
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its subsidiaries' operations.

          SECTION 5.5 Tax Submissions. Except as provided in Section 5.5 to
the Company Disclosure Schedule, if, prior to the Closing Date, the Company
seeks any closing agreement with or private letter ruling from, the IRS,
the Company shall (a) consult with Parent regarding the application for and
negotiation of such closing agreement or ruling request, (b) use
commercially reasonable efforts to permit Parent's designated counsel to
attend meetings or telephone calls with the IRS scheduled by the IRS or the
Company (or the Company's counsel) regarding any such closing agreement or
ruling request, and (c) provide Parent with copies of, and the right to
comment on, any written materials regarding such closing agreement or
ruling request prior to submission to the IRS; provided, however, that
Parent's rights under this Section 5.5 shall not be permitted to unduly
delay or impede the Company from obtaining such closing agreement or
private letter ruling.

                                ARTICLE VI
                           ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

          SECTION 6.1 Stockholders Meetings. (a) The Company shall, as soon
as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, acting
through the Company Board, (i) establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose
of obtaining the Company Requisite Vote (the "Company Stockholders
Meeting"), (ii) include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the
Company Board that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the
approval of the Merger and (iii) use its best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders and to obtain the
Company Requisite Vote; provided, that the Company Board may fail to make
or withdraw, modify or change such recommendation and/or may fail to use
such efforts if it shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel to the Company, that such action is appropriate
in order for the directors of the Company to act in a manner consistent
with their duties under applicable law. At all times, the Company shall
comply with all material legal requirements applicable to such Company
Stockholders Meeting.

               (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement is terminated.

          SECTION 6.2 Proxy Statement. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC a proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") in preliminary form.
The Company shall use its best efforts to resolve as promptly as
practicable any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. Parent shall have
the right to approve prior to filing the Proxy Statement or any amendment
or supplement thereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company is discovered by Parent or
the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party hereto discovering such information shall
promptly notify the other parties and, to the extent required by law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

          SECTION 6.3 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

          SECTION 6.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) From the
date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this
Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and
shall use its best efforts to cause its subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors and employees to, afford the officers, employees,
auditors and other authorized representatives of Parent reasonable access,
consistent with applicable law, at all reasonable times to its officers,
employees, properties, offices and other facilities and to all books and
records, and shall furnish Parent with all financial, operating and other
data and information as Parent, through its officers, employees or
authorized representatives, may from time to time reasonably request in
writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access
or disclosure would violate the rights of any person with which it has a
business relationship, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company
will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

               (b) Each of Parent and the Company will hold and treat and
will cause their respective officers, employees, auditors and other
authorized representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents
and information concerning the other furnished or otherwise made available
to such party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 7,
2004, between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

          SECTION 6.5 Company Acquisition Proposals. (a) The Company agrees
that (i) it and its executive officers and directors shall not and (ii) it
shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that its investment bankers,
attorneys, consultants or other agents or representatives shall not, (A)
directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with
respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, proposal for a merger,
consolidation or other business combination involving the Company and its
subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner an equity
interest representing a 25% or greater economic interest in the Company, or
assets, securities or ownership interests of or in, the Company or any of
its subsidiaries representing 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries, other than the Merger (any such proposal or
offer being hereinafter referred to as a "Company Acquisition Proposal");
provided, however, that for purposes of the references to a Company
Acquisition Proposal in clause (y) of Section 8.2(b)(ii) and (iii) and the
definition of Company Superior Proposal, the percentage 50% shall be
substituted for the percentage 25%, (B) approve, agree to or recommend any
Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement with respect to a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (C) directly or indirectly, engage in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its
properties, books and records or any confidential information or data to
any person relating to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (D) otherwise
knowingly encourage or facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement a Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
subject to the rights of Parent under Section 8.1(d)(ii), nothing contained
in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in
connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange
offer) or from making any legally required disclosure to stockholders with
regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) prior to the approval of the
Merger by the Company's stockholders in accordance with this Agreement,
providing access to its properties, books and records and providing
information or data in response to a request therefor by a person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal if the
Company Board receives from the person so requesting such information an
executed confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality restrictions
on terms at least as favorable to the Company as those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, (iii) prior to the approval of the Merger by the
Company's stockholders in accordance with this Agreement, engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited
bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) prior to the
approval of the Merger by the Company's stockholders in accordance with
this Agreement and following the receipt of a bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section
6.5(a), (A) withdrawing, modifying or changing in any adverse manner its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or (B)
recommending an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal;
if and only to the extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses
(ii), (iii) and (iv) above, the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that, (x) in the case of clause (iv) above only, such Company
Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably capable of being
consummated, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory, timing
and similar aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal and
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the
Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger (any
such more favorable Company Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this
Agreement as a "Company Superior Proposal") and (y) in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii) above only, there is a reasonable possibility that such
actions could lead to a Company Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that
it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons conducted prior to
the date of this Agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition
Proposal. After the date hereof, the Company shall promptly notify Parent
of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public
information or inquiry that it reasonably believes will lead to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the identity of the person
making such Company Acquisition Proposal and the material terms thereof and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, on the status
and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. The Company shall promptly request each person
that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
its consideration of a Company Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy
all confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this
Agreement to or for the benefit of such person by or on behalf of it or any
of its subsidiaries.

               (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.5 to the
contrary, if, at any time prior to the approval of the Merger by the
Company's stockholders in accordance with this Agreement, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal
that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach of
Section 6.5(a) of this Agreement, that such proposal is a Company Superior
Proposal, the Company or the Company Board may terminate this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this sentence, and any purported termination pursuant to this
sentence shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company prior
to or concurrently with such termination pursuant to this Section 6.5(b)
pays to Parent the fee payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b); provided,
further, however, that the Company shall not exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement and the Company Board shall not recommend a
Company Superior Proposal to the Company's stockholders pursuant to this
Section 6.5(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior
written notice advising Parent that the Company or the Company Board
intends to take such action with respect to a Company Superior Proposal,
specifying in reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of the
Company Superior Proposal, this notice to be delivered not less than four
business days prior to the time the action is taken, and, during this four
or more business day period, the Company and its advisors shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent to make adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and the Company Board shall have fully
considered these adjustments and nonetheless concluded in good faith, after
consultation with and receipt of advice from its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that the Company or the Company Board must take the
applicable action.

          SECTION 6.6 Employment and Employee Benefits Matters. (a) From
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to assume and honor, the obligations of the
Company and its subsidiaries under all existing Company Plans and Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall perform the
obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under such Company Plans in
the same manner and to the same extent that the Company and its
subsidiaries would have been required to perform thereunder; provided,
however, that, except as otherwise explicitly provided, nothing herein
shall be construed to prevent, on or following the Effective Time, (i) the
termination of employment of any individual who immediately prior to the
Effective Time was an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(such employees, the "Company Employees") or (ii) the amendment or
termination of any Company Plan to the extent permitted by the terms
thereof and applicable law.

               (b) Subject to Sections 6.6(f) and 6.6(g), for not less than
two years following the Effective Time, subject to applicable law, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide compensation
and employee benefits to the Company Employees which shall be substantially
similar, in the aggregate, to the compensation and employee benefits that
Parent and its subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries) provide to similarly situated employees other than the
Company Employees (such employees other than the Company Employees, the
"Parent Employees").

               (c) To the extent that any employee benefit plan is made
available to the Company Employees on or following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause one of its subsidiaries to, grant the Company
Employees credit for all service with the Company and its subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but
not benefit accrual), to the extent that service of the Parent Employees is
recognized for any such purpose. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements sponsored by Parent and
its subsidiaries (such plans, collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent
coverage under such plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Plan
in which such employee participates immediately before or at any time after
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
vision and/or disability benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

               (d) Parent acknowledges that a "change of control" or a
"change in control," as that term is used in any Company Plan that contains
such term, shall occur at the Effective Time.

               (e) To the extent that the Company has not done so prior to
the Effective Time, upon the date on which distributions are made from the
Company's Pension Plan by reason of the termination of such plan, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (1) credit, in respect of each
participant in the Company's Excess Pension Plan, the lump sum present
value of such participant's accrued benefit under the Excess Pension Plan
to the participant's account maintained under the Company's Excess Savings
Plan, which lump sum (to be calculated using the same actuarial assumptions
and factors as used to calculate lump sum distributions under the Company's
qualified pension plan in connection with its termination) shall thereafter
be governed by the terms and conditions of the Excess Savings Plan, and (2)
contribute an amount of cash equal to the aggregate amount of all
outstanding account balances under the Excess Savings Plan (including,
without limitation, the credits made pursuant to clause (1) of this Section
6.6(e)) to a grantor trust to be established by the Company prior to the
Effective Time.

               (f) In the event of the involuntary termination of
employment without Cause (as defined below) of any Company Employee during
2004 but following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay such Company Employee a bonus for 2004 under
the applicable annual cash bonus plan of the Company (all such plans,
collectively, the "2004 Bonus Plans") in an amount not less than the bonus
to which such Company Employee would have been entitled under such plan as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time assuming satisfaction of
all applicable performance at the "target," "satisfactory," "acceptable" or
other, similar level multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days elapsed from January 1, 2004 through the date of
termination and the denominator of which is 365, and deeming to be
satisfied all other terms and conditions of such plan (including, without
limitation, any requirement of continued employment). Such payment shall be
made at or as soon as practicable after the date of termination. In
addition, to the extent not inconsistent with the preceding two sentences,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, (i) retain the 2004 Bonus
Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Acceptance Date for the entirety of 2004 and (ii) administer the 2004 Bonus
Plans (including the making of bonus determinations thereunder) in a manner
consistent with the Company's historical practice. For purposes of this
Agreement, (i) in the case of a Company Employee who is a party to an
employment agreement or Executive Agreement, "Cause" shall have the meaning
set forth therein, and (ii) in the case of all other Company Employees,
"Cause" shall mean grounds that would permit a "Discharge" under the
Company's separation policy as in effect on the date hereof.

               (g) In the event of the involuntary termination of
employment without Cause (as defined in Section 6.6(f)) of any Company
Employee during 2004 but following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to make an employer fixed contribution with
respect to such Company Employee's account under the qualified and
non-qualified savings plans of the Company (all such plans, collectively,
the "Savings Plans") in an amount not less than the employer fixed
contribution to which such Company Employee would have been entitled under
each such Savings Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
elapsed from January 1, 2004 through the date of termination and the
denominator of which is 365, and deeming to be satisfied all other terms
and conditions of each such Savings Plan (including, without limitation,
any requirement of continued employment). Such fixed contribution shall be
made at the same time as the employer fixed contribution would have been
made if the Company Employee had remained employed through December 31,
2004. To the extent such contribution is not practical or permissible under
the terms of the qualified Savings Plan, Parent shall cause the Company to
make a payment in cash to such affected Company Employee. In addition, to
the extent not inconsistent with the preceding two sentences, Parent shall
cause the Company to retain the employer fixed contribution feature of the
Savings Plans in accordance with its terms as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time for the entirety of 2004, subject to such adjustments
as may be necessary or advisable to maintain the tax qualified status of
the Savings Plan. At the Effective Time, all account balances under the
Savings Plans shall become fully vested.

               (h) For the period beginning on the Effective Time and
ending on the Plan Conversion Date (as hereinafter defined), Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain those Company Plans that
provide medical, prescription drug, dental, vision and disability benefits
for active Company Employees. In addition, for the period beginning on the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Company's
severance policy for the Company Employees (other than those Company
Employees with an individual agreement providing for a severance benefit)
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Section 6.6(h), "Plan Conversion Date" shall mean the first day of the
first plan year following the Effective Time of the health plans for
Parent's similarly situated employees.

          SECTION 6.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and
Insurance. (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director,
officer or employee may have under any Employment Agreement or Company
Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who was (as of the Effective
Time) a present or former officer or director of the Company and its
subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and
disbursements (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the
fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, arising
out of or pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby). Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of reasonable expenses incurred in the defense of any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation within ten business days of receipt by Parent from the
Indemnified Party of a request therefor, subject only to the provisions of
undertakings required for such advancement by the MGCL.

               (b) The charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified Parties than are
set forth in the Charter and the Bylaws in effect immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period ending on the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time in any manner that would materially adversely affect
the rights thereunder as of the Effective Time of any of the Indemnified
Parties. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect until the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time the current policies of the directors'
and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time so long as
the annual premium therefor is not in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (provided, that Parent or
the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less
advantageous to any beneficiary thereof). Parent agrees to honor and
perform under, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and perform
under, all indemnification agreements with the Indemnified Parties entered
into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the date of this
Agreement.

               (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before,
at or after the Effective Time) is made against or involves any Indemnified
Party, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this Section 6.7 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

               (d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided
for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or
otherwise.

          SECTION 6.8 Tax Matters. (a) From the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each of the Company and its subsidiaries will
duly and timely file all Tax Returns and other documents required by it to
be filed with federal, state and local Tax authorities the failure to file
of which could have a material negative impact, financial or otherwise,
subject to extensions permitted by law and properly granted by the
appropriate authority, provided that the Company notifies Parent that it or
any of its subsidiaries is availing itself of such extensions, and
provided, further, that such extensions do not adversely affect the
Company's status as a REIT under the Code.

               (b) Each party shall cooperate in the preparation,
execution, and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications, or
other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

               (c) The Company shall provide Parent an opinion of Arnold &
Porter LLP or other outside counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
dated as of the Closing Date, to the Company in the form of Exhibit 6.8(c)
(the "REIT Opinion"). In rendering the REIT Opinion, such counsel shall be
entitled to rely upon customary assumptions, qualifications, and
representations as to factual matters (but not legal conclusions),
provided, however, that such assumptions, qualifications, and
representations are set forth in writing and are reasonably satisfactory to
Parent.

          SECTION 6.9 Further Action; Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall cooperate with the
other and use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to satisfy the conditions to Closing
set forth herein and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the financing for the Merger
based upon the Commitment Letters or alternative financing; provided, that
Parent and Merger Sub are not required to procure such alternative
financing if the material terms and conditions of such alternative
financing are in the aggregate materially less favorable than contemplated
in the Commitment Letters (it being understood that the foregoing proviso
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations under this
Agreement if all conditions to their obligation under Article VII hereof
are satisfied or waived or are readily capable of being satisfied but
Parent and Merger Sub are unable to satisfy their obligation to pay the
Merger Consideration). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each party hereto agrees, to the extent necessary, to make an
appropriate filing pursuant to any Antitrust Law (as defined below) with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to any Antitrust Law and to take all other actions necessary,
proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under any Antitrust Law as soon as practicable.

               (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub on the one hand, and the
Company on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced
in Section 6.9(a) to obtain any requisite approvals and authorizations for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law,
use its best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) keep the other party informed of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
(the "DOJ") or any other United States or foreign governmental authority
and of any communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any such
other governmental authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the
FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable governmental authority or other
person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences. For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust
Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and
foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

               (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
the parties contained in Sections 6.9(a) and 6.9(b), if any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable governmental authority or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prohibit or
materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
its best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, in order to resolve such objections or suits which, in
any case if not resolved, would reasonably be expected to prohibit or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including selling, holding separate or otherwise
disposing of or conducting its business in a manner which would resolve
such objections or suits or agreeing to sell, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of or conduct its business in a manner which would resolve such
objections or suits or permitting the sale, holding separate or other
disposition of, any of its assets or the assets of its subsidiaries or the
conducting of its business in a manner which would resolve such objections
or suits. Without excluding other possibilities, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be materially delayed if
unresolved objections or suits delay or would reasonably be expected to
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby beyond
February 28, 2005.

               (d) Subject to the obligations of the parties under Section
6.9(c), in the event that any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a governmental
authority or private party challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other
and use its respective best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
parties hereto shall use their respective best efforts to change the
proposed structure of the transactions contemplated hereby if such change
would cause such action or proceeding to be vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned in a manner that preserves the intended benefits of the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no party hereto
shall be required to agree to any change that (i) modifies the amount or
kind of consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock as
provided herein or (ii) materially adversely effects the ability of Parent
to obtain financing for the transactions contemplated hereby or the
material terms thereof in the aggregate.

               (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.9 shall limit a party's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) so long as such party
has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this Section 6.9.

          SECTION 6.10 Public Announcements. Each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub agrees that the initial public release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be jointly issued by
the parties and thereafter each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on press releases or
announcements relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in advance of their issuance, it being understood that the final form and
content of any such release or announcement shall be at the final
discretion of the disclosing party.

          SECTION 6.11 Dividends. (a) From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall not declare or pay any dividend or
distribution to its stockholders without the prior written consent of
Parent in its sole discretion; provided, that the written consent of Parent
shall not be required for the authorization and payment of (i)
distributions required by the Code for the Company to maintain its REIT
status or necessary to eliminate any federal Tax liability; and (ii)
quarterly distributions of $0.47 per share (the "Quarterly Rate") of
Company Common Stock per quarter to the holders thereof for the quarter
ending September 30, 2004 and quarterly distributions of up to $0.47 per
share for each quarter thereafter ending prior to the Effective Time with
record and payment dates in accordance with past practice. In the event
that a distribution with respect to the Company Common Stock permitted by
this Section 6.11 (including pursuant to Section 6.11(b) below) has (x) a
record date prior to the Effective Time and (y) has not been paid as of the
Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive such distribution from the Company at the time such shares are
exchanged pursuant to Article II of this Agreement.

               (b) The Company shall declare a dividend (the "Closing
Dividend") to its stockholders, the record date for which shall be the
close of business on the last business day prior to the Effective Time. The
Closing Dividend shall be an amount equal to the Quarterly Rate, multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed since
the last dividend record date through and including the Effective Time, and
the denominator is the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in
which the Effective Time occurs.

          SECTION 6.12 Contingent Stock Agreement. (a) As of the Effective
Time, Parent hereby expressly assumes and agrees to perform the CSA, as
successor to the Company, in the same manner and to the same extent that
the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken
place. Parent hereby agrees to take all actions necessary after the
Effective Time to comply with the CSA, including taking all actions
necessary to ensure that following the Effective Time the Merger will not
have a prejudicial effect on the Holders (as defined in the CSA) with
respect to their non-taxable receipt of securities pursuant to the CSA. The
Company shall promptly deliver a notice under the CSA that the Merger is
not a Prohibited Transaction (as defined in the CSA) and cooperate with
Parent and facilitate communications between Parent and the Representatives
(as defined in the CSA) regarding the CSA.

               (b) Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers,
agents and representatives against any and all Costs incurred by any of
them in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding asserted or
commenced by any Representative or otherwise by or on behalf of any Holder
(as defined in the CSA) arising out of, resulting from or relating to (x)
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (y) the
breach of any of obligations of Parent pursuant to this Section 6.12.
Parent shall have the right to control the defense of any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding subject to indemnification pursuant to the
preceding, but shall consult fully with the Company in connection with the
defense and settlement of such matter and shall not enter into any
settlement that adversely affects the rights of the Company under the CSA
prior to the Effective Time, without the Company's prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, the obligations of
Parent under this Section 6.12(b) shall terminate and the Company shall
thereafter have the right to control all such claims, actions, suits or
proceedings.

                                ARTICLE VII

               (c) all material consents, filings, approvals, orders or
authorizations from any governmental authority required to consummate the
Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
obtained or made, except for any such consents, filings, approvals, orders,
or authorizations, the failure of which to have been obtained or made prior
to the Effective Time would not, individually or in the aggregate, provide
a reasonable basis to conclude that the parties or their respective
directors or officers would be subject to the risk of criminal prosecution.

          SECTION 7.2 Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub.
The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger shall be
further subject to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the Effective
Time of each of the following conditions:

representations and warranties set forth in the first three sentences of
Section 3.3) shall be true and correct in all material respects, in each
case as of the date of this Agreement and immediately before the Effective
Time as though made immediately before the Effective Time (except those
representations and warranties that speak of an earlier date, which shall
be true and correct as of such earlier date), except where the failure of
any such representations and warranties referred to in clause (ii) above to
be so true and correct, in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect;

               (b) the Company shall have performed in all material
respects the obligations, and complied in all material respects with the
agreements and covenants, required to be performed by or complied with by
it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date;

               (c) after the date of this Agreement, there shall not have

the Closing Date, properly elected to treat each such subsidiary as a

have taken no action (or failed to have taken any action) that is
inconsistent with such status;

               (g) Parent shall have received the REIT Opinion; and

               (h) Parent and Merger Sub shall have available to them
sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and other Merger
related costs and expenses; provided, however, that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the condition set forth in this Section
7.2(h) shall be deemed to have been satisfied unless the reason for the
unavailability of sufficient funds is the result of the occurrence of any
of the following events: (1) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any
suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States (whether or
not mandatory), (2) the occurrence of any act of war or terrorism or
another material event resulting in a major dislocation of financial
markets that materially and adversely affects the ability of financial
institutions in the United States to extend credit or syndicate loans, (3)
any mandatory limitation by any governmental authority on the extension of
credit generally by banks or other financial institutions, or (4) the
occurrence of any act of war or terrorism that materially and adversely
affects the United States retail shopping mall business taken as a whole.

          SECTION 7.3 Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The

following conditions:

               (a) (i) the representations and warranties of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to Parent
Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct and (ii) the

date, which shall be true and correct as of such earlier date), except
where the failure of any such representations and warranties referred to in
clause (ii) to be so true and correct, in the aggregate, would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect;

               (b) each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in
all material respects the obligations, and complied in all material
respects with the agreements and covenants, required to be performed by or
complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date;
and

               (c) the Company shall have received certificates of the
Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of each of Parent
and Merger Sub, certifying that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.3(a)
and 7.3(b) have been satisfied.

                               ARTICLE VIII

                     TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

          SECTION 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the receipt of
the Company Requisite Vote:

               (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

               (b) by written notice of either Parent or the Company if:

                   (i) any governmental authority shall have issued a final
order, decree or ruling or taken any other final action restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such
order, decree, ruling or other action is or shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this clause (i) shall not be available to any party which has
not used its reasonable best efforts to cause such order, decree, ruling or
other action to be lifted or otherwise taken action necessary to comply
with Section 6.9;

                   (ii) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or
before February 28, 2005 (as it may be extended from time to time as
provided for in this clause (ii), the "Termination Date"); provided, that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) shall
not be available to the party seeking to terminate if any action of such
party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) or the failure of such party
(or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the Effective
Time has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective
Time to occur on or before the Termination Date and such action or failure
to perform constitutes a breach of this Agreement; provided, further,
however, that if prior to the Termination Date each of the conditions set
forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied or waived or, in the case of
conditions which by their terms are to be fulfilled at the Closing, shall
have been capable of being readily satisfied or waived, but the condition
set forth in Section 7.2(h) shall not have been satisfied or waived, the
Company shall have the option, in its sole discretion, by written notice to
Parent, to extend the Termination Date on one or more occasions for a
period of no more than 120 days in the aggregate; or

                   (iii) at the Company Stockholders Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the Company Requisite Vote is not
obtained or the Company Requisite Vote is not obtained by the fifth
business day prior to the Termination Date;

               (c) by written notice of the Company:

                   (i) if there shall have been a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in
either Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied and which shall not
have been cured prior to the earlier of (1) thirty days following notice of
such breach and (2) the Termination Date; provided, that the Company shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (i)
if the Company is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

                   (ii) prior to the approval of the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company in accordance with this Agreement, in
accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section
6.5(b); or

                   (iii) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on
or before January 31, 2005 and on or prior to such date each of the
conditions set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied or waived or,
in the case of conditions which by their terms are to be fulfilled at the
Closing, shall have been capable of being readily satisfied or waived, but
the condition set forth in Section 7.2(h) shall not have been satisfied or
waived.

               (d) by written notice of Parent:

                   (i) if there shall have been a material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
contained in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in either
Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied and which shall not have
been cured prior to the earlier of (1) thirty days following notice of such
breach and (2) the Termination Date; provided, that Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (i) if Parent
or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

                   (ii) if the Company Board shall have withdrawn, modified
or changed in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of
this Agreement or the Merger or shall have recommended to the stockholders
of the Company a Company Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or
shall have resolved to effect any of the foregoing.

          SECTION 8.2 Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of any party hereto, except with respect to Sections 6.4(b) and 6.10,
this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX, which shall survive such
termination; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for any willful and material breach hereof.

               (b) (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by
the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), then the Company shall pay the
Parent Termination Fee to General Growth Limited Partnership, a Delaware
limited partnership ("Parent OP"), at or prior to the time of termination
by wire transfer of same day funds.

                   (ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii), and (x) prior to such termination any
person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act) shall have publicly made a Company Acquisition Proposal, which
proposal is not withdrawn prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, and
(y) within 12 months of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(iii), the Company enters into an agreement in respect of any
Company Acquisition Proposal or a transaction pursuant to which any Company
Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall pay the Parent
Termination Fee to Parent OP, by wire transfer of same day funds, on the
date of execution of the agreement in respect of the Company Acquisition
Proposal or, if earlier, consummation of such transaction.

                   (iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), and (x) prior to such termination
any person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act) shall have publicly made a Company Acquisition Proposal,
which proposal is not withdrawn prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting,
and (y) within 12 months of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii) the Company enters into an agreement in respect of any
Company Acquisition Proposal or a transaction pursuant to which any Company
Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall pay the Parent
Termination Fee to Parent OP, by wire transfer of same day funds, on the
date of execution of the agreement in respect of the Company Acquisition
Proposal or, if earlier, consummation of such transaction.

               (iv)"Parent Termination Fee" means the amount that may be
received by Parent OP without adversely affecting Parent's ability to meet
the requirements of either or both of Sections 856(c)(2) or (3) of the Code
(the "Parent Qualifying Amount"), as such Parent Qualifying Amount shall be
determined by Parent's independent accountants; provided, however, that
under no circumstances shall the Parent Termination Fee exceed $155
million. No later than December 15 of the calendar year in which payment of
the Parent Termination Fee occurs, Parent's independent accountants, in
their sole discretion, shall make a final determination, subject to this
clause (iii), of the Parent Qualifying Amount (the "Final Parent Qualifying
Amount"). If the Final Parent Qualifying Amount, as determined by Parent's
independent accountants, is greater than the amount previously paid by the
Company as a Parent Termination Fee, within five business days after
receipt of written notice from Parent, the Company shall pay to Parent OP,
by wire transfer of same day funds, an amount equal to the excess of the
Final Parent Qualifying Amount over such amount previously paid by the
Company. If the Final Parent Qualifying Amount, as determined by Parent's
independent accountants, is less than the amount previously paid by the
Company as a Parent Termination Fee, no later than December 31 of such
calendar year Parent OP shall pay to the Company, by wire transfer of same
day funds, an amount equal to the excess of the amount previously paid by
the Company over the Final Parent Qualifying Amount. The amount by which
the Parent Termination Fee is reduced pursuant to the first sentence of
this clause (iii) as a result of Parent's potential inability to satisfy
the requirements of either or both of Sections 856(c)(2) or (3) of the Code
shall be placed in escrow by the Company and shall not be released unless
Parent provides the Company with either or both of (A) a letter from
Parent's independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that may be
received at that time by Parent OP without Parent failing to satisfy the
requirements of either or both of Sections 856(c)(2) and/or (3) of the Code
or (B) an opinion letter from outside counsel stating (x) that Parent has
received a ruling from the IRS stating that all or a portion of such amount
would be (i) treated as not includable in the calculation of "gross income"
for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (ii)
characterized in one of the categories of income enumerated in 856(C)(2)(A)
through (H) and 856(C)(3)(A) through (I) of the Code or (y) that the
receipt by Parent OP of all or a portion of such amount following receipt
of and pursuant to such ruling would not be deemed constructively received
prior thereto by Parent OP, and at such time either such letter referred to
in (A) or (B) of this sentence (each, a "Release Letter") is delivered,
shall promptly release the amount referred to in such letter to Parent OP.
Such escrow arrangement shall expire, and remaining funds returned to the
Company, on the date that is three years after the date of this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the number of distributions
pursuant to this escrow prior to the date of the expiration of such escrow.

          SECTION 8.3 Expenses. (a) If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) or 8.1(d)(ii), the Company shall pay to
Parent OP all of the costs and expenses incurred by Parent or its
affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $25 million
(collectively, "Parent Termination Costs"), such payment to be made not
later than two days after being notified by Parent of the amount of such
costs and expenses. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in Section 8.2 hereof and this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to Section 8.2
hereof or this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain such payments, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the fee
set forth in Section 8.2 hereof, the expenses set forth in this Section 8.3
or any portion of such fee or expenses, the Company shall pay Parent's
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
from the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment. Parent may reduce the amount of such Parent Termination Costs to
be paid by the Company as not to adversely affect Parent's ability to meet
the requirements of either or both of Sections 856(c)(2) or (3) of the Code
and the amount of such reduction shall be placed in escrow by the Company
and shall not be released unless Parent provides the Company with a Release
Letter, and at such time any Release Letter is delivered, shall promptly
release the amount referred to in such Release Letter to Parent OP. Such
escrow arrangement shall expire, and remaining funds returned to the
Company, on the date that is three years after the date of this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the number of distributions
pursuant to this escrow prior to the date of the expiration of such escrow.

               (b) Except as provided for in this Section 8.3 and otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement, each party shall bear its own
expenses in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

          SECTION 8.4 Amendment. Subject to Section 9.14, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of
their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective
Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company Requisite Vote;
provided, however, that, after receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, no
amendment may be made which (i) by law requires the further approval of the
stockholders of the Company or (ii) reduces the amount or changes the form
of Merger Consideration, in each case, without further approval of the
stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

          SECTION 8.5 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) subject to the
requirements of applicable law and compliance with the proviso in Section
8.4, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an

               SECTION 9.10 Specific Performance; Jurisdiction. The parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the

the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement exclusively in The Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of
The Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out
of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than The Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any court
of the United States located in the State of Delaware and (iv) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.2.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of
any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in Section 9.2 shall be effective service of
process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

               SECTION 9.11 Parent Guarantee. Parent agrees to take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to perform all of its respective agreements, covenants and
obligations under this Agreement. Parent unconditionally guarantees to the
Company the full and complete performance by Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, of its respective obligations under this
Agreement and shall be liable for any breach of any covenant or obligation
of Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this
Agreement. Merger Sub shall at all times be a direct or indirect subsidiary
of Parent. This is a guarantee of payment and performance and not
collectibility. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first
against Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, protest,
notice and all demands whatsoever in connection with the performance of its
obligations set forth in this Section 9.11. Parent further waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that may be
derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is
available to Merger Sub, in connection with such performance.

               SECTION 9.12 Interpretation. When reference is made in this
Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Whenever the words "herein," "hereof," "hereto," or
"hereunder" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific Section of this
Agreement. Whenever used in this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly
provided or unless the context otherwise requires, any noun or pronoun
shall be deemed to include the plural as well as the singular. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Schedule
or the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information
shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the term "Material Adverse
Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. The parties to this
Agreement have participated jointly in the negotiating and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

               SECTION 9.13 Obligations of Parent and Company. Whenever
this Agreement requires a subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirements shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of
Parent to cause such subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this
Agreement requires a subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirements shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such subsidiary to take such action.

               SECTION 9.14 Survival; No Amendment. In the event that the
Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, under this
Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in
part after the Effective Time, including without limitation Article II,
Sections 6.3, 6.6, 6.7, 6.11 and 6.12, and Article IX. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, from and after the Effective
Time, this Agreement shall not be amended, modified or terminated in any
manner that adversely affects the rights of any person (whether or not a
party hereto) other than Parent or the Surviving Corporation contained in
Article II, Sections 6.3, 6.6, 6.7, 6.11, and 6.12, or Article IX.


          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by
their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
