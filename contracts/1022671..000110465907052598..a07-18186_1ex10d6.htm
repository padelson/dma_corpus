(iv) The Representative will deliver or will cause to be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, surrendered Certificates or Option Assignment
Agreements and Letters of Transmittal. Common Stockholders or Optionholders
will be entitled to look only to the Representative for payment of their
claims for the consideration set forth in this _Section 2.10_ , without
interest thereon.

  

(v) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or

_Withholding Taxes_ "). To the extent that Withholding Taxes are required to
be deducted or withheld, the Company shall reduce by the amount of such
Withholding Taxes the Fully-Diluted Stockholder Proceeds paid to the
Representative for distribution pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)_ , and such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement (including determination of Cash and Working Capital) as having

the Representative, on behalf of the holder of such Certificate or Option,
written notice of any Withholding Taxes so deducted or withheld. Any
Withholding Taxes so withheld shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation to
the appropriate taxing authorities.

  

(vii) If payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Common Stock is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
a surrendered certificate of Common Stock is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that the certificate of Common Stock so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of
the registered holder of the certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representative that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not payable.

  

2.11 _Redemption_. At the Closing, the Company shall redeem in full the
Companys Series A Preferred Stock and each Person who is a holder of such

(b) Subsequent to the Closing and subject to _Section 2.12(g)_ , the
Estimated Merger Consideration shall be _increased_ or _decreased_ as
follows:

  

(i) _minus_  the amount (if any) by which Estimated Cash exceeds the Final
Cash, or _plus_  the amount (if any) by which Final Cash exceeds Estimated
Cash; and

  

(ii) _minus_  the amount (if any) by which the Estimated Working Capital
exceeds the Final Working Capital, or _plus_ the amount (if any) by which
Final Working Capital exceeds Estimated Working Capital.

  

The Estimated Merger Consideration, as so increased or decreased in
accordance with this _Section 2.12(b)_ , shall be the " _Final Merger
Consideration_ " hereunder.

  

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than thirty (30)
calendar days after the Closing Date, the Representative shall (i) prepare a
statement of the calculation of Cash and Working Capital, in each case as of
the Measurement Time, together with calculations of the Final Merger
Consideration (the " _Closing Date Statement_ "), and (ii) deliver the
Closing Date Statement to Parent. The Closing Date Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with
the methodologies, policies, practices, classifications, judgments,
estimation techniques, assumptions and principles used in the Financial
Statements.

  

(d) In connection with the preparation of the Closing Date Statement, Parent
shall permit the Representative and its representatives reasonable access to
books and records, personnel, and facilities of the Company to permit it to
prepare the Closing Date Statement. Parent shall have the right to review
the work papers of the Representative underlying or utilized in preparing the
Closing Date Statement and the calculation of the Final Merger Consideration
to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy and fairness of the
presentation of the Closing Date Statement and calculation of the Final
Merger Consideration in conformity with this Agreement.

  

(e) Within thirty (30) calendar days after its receipt of the Closing Date
Statement, Parent shall either inform the Representative in writing that the
Closing Date Statement is acceptable or object thereto in writing, setting
forth a specific description of each of its objections. If Parent so objects
and the parties do not resolve such objections on a mutually agreeable basis
within thirty (30) calendar days after the Representatives receipt of
Parents objections, the remaining disputed items shall be resolved within an
additional thirty (30) calendar days by Deloitte and Touche LLP or another
mutually agreed accounting firm (the " _Referral Firm_ "). Parent shall make
available to the Representative (upon request following the

       

giving of any objection to the Closing Date Statement) the workpapers of
Parent generated in connection with its review of the Closing Date Statement.
Upon the agreement of the parties, the decision of the Referral Firm or if
Parent fails to deliver an objection to the Representative within the first
30-day period referred to above, then the Closing Date Statement, as so
adjusted (the " _Final Closing Date Statement_ "), shall be final, conclusive
and binding against the parties hereto. The statements of Cash and Working
Capital set forth in the Final Closing Statement shall be the " _Final Cash_
" and " _Final Working Capital_ " for all purposes hereunder.

  

(f) In resolving any disputed item, the Referral Firm (i) shall be bound by
the provisions of this _Section 2.12_ , (ii) may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value claimed for such item or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Parent or the Representative,
(iii) shall limit its decision to such items as are in dispute and (iv) shall
make its determination based solely on presentations by Parent and the
Representative which are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set
forth in this Agreement (i.e. not on the basis of independent review). The
fees and expenses of the Referral Firm shall be allocated between Parent and
the Representative in such a way that (i) Parent shall be responsible for
that portion of the fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the aggregate dollar value of disputed items submitted to the
Referral Firm that are resolved against Parent (as finally determined by the
Referral Firm) and the denominator of which is the total dollar value of the
disputed items so submitted and (ii) the Representative shall be responsible
for the remaining amount of fees and expenses, which such amount shall be
paid out of the Temporary Escrow Amount. In the event of any
dispute regarding such allocation, the Referral Firm shall determine the
allocation of its fees and expenses as between Parent and the Representative
in accordance with such allocation methodology, such determination to be
final and binding on both Parent and the Representative.

  

(g) Promptly after their receipt of the Final Closing Date Statement, the
Representative and Parent shall compute the difference, if any, between the
Estimated Merger Consideration and the Final Merger Consideration. If the
Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger Consideration, then
Parent shall be entitled to receive, promptly and in any event within five
(5) Business Days, from the Fully-Diluted Stockholders (in accordance with
their Ownership Percentages) an amount in cash equal to such excess amount,
plus interest at the rate of five percent 5% per annum from the Closing Date
to the date of payment, to be paid solely out of the Temporary Escrow
Agreement. PARENT AGREES THAT ITS SOLE SOURCE OF RECOVERY UNDER THIS _SECTION
2.12_ SHALL BE LIMITED TO, AND SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE, THE
TEMPORARY ESCROW AMOUNT. If the Estimated Merger Consideration is less than
the Final Merger Consideration, the Representative shall be entitled to
receive, promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days, from Parent
an amount in cash equal to such deficiency, plus interest at the rate of five
percent 5% per annum from the Closing Date to the date of payment, which
amount will be distributed by the Representative to the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders in accordance with their Ownership Percentages.

  

(h) The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Date
Statement hereunder is to measure the Cash and Working Capital as of the
closing of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
methodologies, policies, practices, classifications, judgments,

       

estimation techniques, assumptions and principles used in the preparation of
the calculation of Target Working Capital and the Initial Closing Date
Statement.

  

2.13 _Letters of Credit_. With regard to letters of credit or similar
financial guaranties issued under the Senior Credit Agreement and outstanding
at the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Company Letters of Credit_ "),
Parent will either, at the Closing, (a) arrange for the issuance of
replacement letters of credit therefor that are reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to the beneficiaries of the Company Letters of Credit
so that such beneficiaries fully release and discharge the Company Letters
of Credit to the satisfaction of the Senior Lender under the Senior
Credit Agreement, or (b) arrange for the issuance of additional letters of
credit to support and back-up the Company Letters of Credit to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Senior Lender under the Senior Credit
Agreement, in either case, such that the Senior Lender under the Senior
Credit Agreement will release and discharge the Company and the Subsidiary
under the Senior Credit Agreement even though the Company Letters of Credit
remain outstanding.

(a) The Company shall update the Disclosure Schedule provided to the Parent

Disclosure Schedule to the Parent and Merger Sub within seven (7) days of the
date of this Agreement. Parent shall have five (5) days following the
delivery of the Disclosure Schedule to review the new information and facts
so disclosed. In the event that such new information or facts would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, Parent may
deliver to the Company a notice setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for such conclusion and its election to terminate its obligations under this
Agreement no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the sixth calendar day
following the date of such disclosure. In the event that Parent has the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_  and
_Section 8.1(c)(i)_ , then such termination shall be Parents sole remedy for
any breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained
herein which would have existed by reason of the Company not
having supplemented

       

or amended the Disclosure Schedule. In the event that Parent does not have
the right or for any reason does not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 5.6(a)_ following any such disclosure, then such disclosure
shall be deemed to amend and/or supplement the original Disclosure Schedule
hereto and cure and correct for all purposes any breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained herein which would
have existed by reason of the Company not having so amended or supplemented
the Disclosure Schedule.

  

(b) Thereafter, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company of (1) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence of which the
notifying party determines could reasonably be expected to cause any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, and (2) any failure of the Company,
Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy,
in any material respect, any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6(b)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect
any remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

respect to any group of employees employed by the Company and the Subsidiary
as of the Closing Date (including, without limitation, those on temporary
layoffs or approved leave of absence) (" _Employees_ "). Nothing herein

Companys workforce and Benefit Plans with those of the Parent. Except for
any existing employment agreement in place as of the Closing Date, all
Employees shall continue as employees at will. Parent shall, or shall cause

that relates to employees, employee benefit matters or labor matters, (ii)
for dismissal, wrongful termination, constructive dismissal or termination,
or severance pay or other termination pay, if any, or (iii) under or with

comply with) any such laws.

the Subsidiary shall honor the obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary
under the provisions of all Benefit Plans, _provided_ , _however_ , that
this provision shall not prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiary from amending, suspending or terminating any such Benefit Plan to
the extent permitted under the respective terms of such Benefit Plan,
including in connection with a transition to Parents or the Surviving
Corporations other benefit plans.

9.5 _Waivers_. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same, except as provided in _Section 5.6_. No
waiver by a party of any condition or of any breach of any term, covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be effective
unless

       

in writing, and no waiver in any one or more instances shall be deemed to be
a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach in other
instances or a waiver of any other condition or breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty.

  

9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. A facsimile transmission of an
executed counterpart signature page shall be deemed an original.

  

9.7 _Interpretation_. The headings preceding the text of Articles and
Sections included in this Agreement and the headings to Sections of
the Disclosure Schedule are for convenience only and shall not be deemed part
of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule or be given any effect
in interpreting this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule. The use of the
masculine, feminine or neuter gender herein shall not limit any provision of
this Agreement. The use of the terms "including" or "include" shall in all
cases herein mean "including, without limitation" or "include, without
limitation," respectively.  Underscored references to Articles, Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules shall refer to those portions of this Agreement. Time
is of the essence of each and every covenant, agreement and obligation in
this Agreement. Neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger
Sub, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in breach of any covenant
contained in this Agreement if such partys deemed breach is the result of
any action or inaction on the part of the other.

  

9.8 _APPLICABLE LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF.

Corporation without the prior written consent of the Company and
the Representative. For all purposes hereof, a transfer, sale or disposition
of a majority of the capital stock or other voting interest of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (whether by contract or otherwise) shall be deemed an
assignment hereunder. Any purported assignment in contravention of this
_Section 9.10_ shall be null and void.

deliver to the other parties such other documents, assignments and other
instruments as may be reasonably required to effectuate completely the
Merger, and to effect and evidence the provisions of this Agreement and the
Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

9.13 _Entire Understanding_. The Exhibits, Schedules and Disclosure Schedule
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.  This Agreement and the Related Agreements set forth the entire
agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and supersedes any and all
prior agreements, arrangements and understandings among the parties.

Agreement and injunctive or other equitable relief in favor of the other
party as a remedy for any such breach, in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

9.17 _Disclosure Schedule_. The inclusion of information in the Disclosure
Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to any of the Company or the Subsidiary. In addition, matters
reflected in the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedule. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the
court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have
the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and

intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict

federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise.
