 WHEREAS, the parties intend that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; 

  

 WHEREAS, upon consummation of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") will be converted into the right to receive $48.25 per share in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have unanimously approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

three-month period ended on March 31, 2008 (the " _March Unaudited
Financial Statements_ ") and the other items listed on Schedule 6.06(b),
provided, however, that if the Companys financial condition and results of
operations as reflected in the financial statements included in the Companys
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2008
differ materially and adversely from that reflected in the March Unaudited

The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ ".

ARTICLE II  

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 SECTION 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

   

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock (all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $48.25 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.02, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (d) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, the Shares, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company approved in advance by the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange 

   ##### 

  

    

Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however,
that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to
the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.01(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate representing such Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required solely by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

  

 (c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as provided herein or by Law. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority 

   ##### 

  

    

shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto. 

  

 (e) _No Liability_. None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any cash (including any dividends or distributions with respect to such Shares) delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Stock Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax laws and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

  

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if required by the Surviving Corporation, an indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a). 

  

 SECTION 2.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law.

 SECTION 3.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. (a) Each of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company (each a " _Subsidiary_ ") is a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or limited liability partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event, circumstance, change or effect that (x) is, or would be reasonably likely to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (y) would prevent the consummation of the Transactions; provided, however, that in no event shall any of the following, alone or in combination, be deemed to constitute, nor shall any of the following be taken into account in determining whether there has been, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) any event, circumstance, change or effect resulting from or relating to (A) a change in general economic, political or financial market conditions, including interest or exchange rates, (B) a change in the industries, or in the business conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, including, but not limited to, a change in general economic conditions that affect the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct their business, (C) any change in accounting requirements or principles required by changes in GAAP (or any interpretations thereof) or required by any change in applicable Laws (or any interpretations thereof), (D) any adoption, implementation, promulgation, repeal, modification, reinterpretation or proposal of any Law after the date hereof, (E) any acts of terrorism or war or any weather related event, fire or natural disaster or any escalation thereof, (F) the announcement of the execution of this Agreement or the pendency of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Transactions"), including the impact thereof on relationships with current and prospective clients, employer partners, vendors, suppliers and employees, (G) the identity of Parent or any of its Affiliates as the acquiror of the Company or 

   #####

compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action required by or the
failure to take any action prohibited by, this Agreement (other than (i)
pursuant to any requirement to operate in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice or to make the representations and
warranties of the Company accurate, or (ii) the consummation of the
Transactions) or consented to by Parent, except, in the case of the foregoing
clauses (A), (B), (D) and (E), to the extent such event, circumstance, change
or effect would have a materially disproportionate impact on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared to other persons in the
industries in which the Company and the Subsidiaries conduct their business
after taking into account the size of the Company relative to such
other persons; (ii) any failure to meet internal or published projections,
forecasts, performance measures, operating statistics or revenue or earnings
predictions for any period or a decline in the price or trading volume of the
Company Common Stock (provided that, except as otherwise provided in this
definition, the underlying causes of such failure or decline may be considered
in determining whether there is a Company Material Adverse Effect); or (iii)
any Actions, challenges or investigations relating to this Agreement or
transactions contemplated hereby made or brought by any of the current or
former stockholders of the Company (on their own behalf or on behalf of
the Company) resulting from, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Transactions.

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Termination Fee_ " means an amount equal to $39,000,000, except if the Company Termination Fee becomes payable by the Company in connection with an Acquisition Proposal submitted in writing prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date (or any subsequent amendment or modification thereto, which, considered as a whole, is no less favorable to the Company than the Acquisition Proposal prior to such amendment or modification), then the Company Termination Fee shall be $19,500,000. 

  

 (e) Regardless of whether this Agreement has been terminated, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary or otherwise, the right of the Company to receive the Parent Termination Fee and the additional losses pursuant to Section 8.03(b)(v) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company for any losses, damages, costs or expenses suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated or as a result of any breach of this Agreement by the Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, and upon such payment neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions (except the liability of the Parent and Merger Sub with respect to the second sentence of Section 8.03(a), the provisions of Sections 6.02(b), 6.06(b) and 6.06(c) and in the case of fraud); provided however, that in no event shall the total aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or otherwise exceed $66,000,000.

 (c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. 

   

 SECTION 9.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, 

   ##### 

  

    

all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible. 

  

 SECTION 9.05 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the parties pursuant hereto (a) no party makes, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions, (b) no person has been authorized by any party to make any representation or warranty on behalf of such party relating to such party or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions and, if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to any party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include representations or warranties unless any such materials or information is the subject of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 9.06 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto and their respective Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto or their respective Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder to any controlled affiliate of Parent, _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. 

  

 SECTION 9.07 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.04 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons). 

  

 SECTION 9.08 _Remedies; Specific Performance; Expenses_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of the Company to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all actions pursuant thereto as are necessary on its part to the consummation of the Merger and including assisting Parent with regard to arranging and consummating the Debt Financing and the Alternate Financing, as applicable, will cause irreparable injury to the Parent and Merger Sub. Unless and until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction 

   ##### 

  

    

or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the
requirements that Company take all actions pursuant hereto as are necessary
on its part to the consummation of the Merger and including assisting Parent
with respect to arranging and consummating the Debt Financing and the
Alternate Financing, as applicable, in the Delaware Court of Chancery, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
Expenses of the Parent or Merger Sub incurred in connection with any Action
brought by the Parent or Merger Sub relating to any injunction or injunctions
or the right to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement provided for in the foregoing sentence shall be paid by the Company
in the event that Parent is successful on the merits in such Action. 

  

 SECTION 9.09 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to Contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named court, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by the above-named court. 

  

 SECTION 9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.10. 

  

 SECTION 9.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after the adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made except as allowed under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. 

  

 SECTION 9.12 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument 

   ##### 

  

    

in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of
any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

  

 SECTION 9.13 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 9.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
