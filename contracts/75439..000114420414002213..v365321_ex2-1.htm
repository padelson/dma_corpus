7.2 Indemnification Procedures for Third-Party Claim.

  



  

(a) Upon obtaining Knowledge of any Claim by a third party that has
given rise to, or is expected to give rise to, a claim for indemnification
hereunder, Purchaser shall give written notice (" _Notice of Claim_ ") of
such claim or demand to the Shareholders, specifying in reasonable detail
such information as the Indemnified Party may have with respect to such
indemnification claim (including copies of any summons, complaint or other
pleading that may have been served on it and any written claim, demand,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same). Subject
to the limitations set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ hereof, no failure or delay
by Purchaser in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise
affect the obligation of the Shareholders to indemnify and hold the
Indemnified Party harmless, except to the extent that such failure or delay
shall have actually adversely affected the Shareholders' ability to defend
against, settle or satisfy any Claims for which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

  



  

(b) If the claim or demand set forth in the Notice of Claim given by
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ hereof is a claim or demand
asserted by a third party, the Shareholders shall have fifteen (15) days
after the date on which the Notice of Claim is delivered to notify Purchaser
in writing of its election to defend such third party claim or demand on
behalf of the Indemnified Party. If the Shareholders elect to defend such
third party claim or demand, Purchaser shall make available to the Holding
Company and Shareholders and its agents and representatives all records and
other materials that are reasonably required in the defense of such third
party claim or demand and shall otherwise cooperate with, and assist the
Shareholders in the defense of, such third party claim or demand, and so long
as the Shareholders are defending such third party claim in good faith, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay, settle or compromise such third party claim
or demand. If the Shareholders elect to defend such third party claim or
demand, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense of such third party claim or demand at the Shareholders' expense. In
the event, however, that such Indemnified Party reasonably determines that
representation by counsel to the Shareholders of both the Shareholders and
such Indemnified Party could reasonably be expected to present counsel with a
conflict of interest, then the Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel
to represent or defend it in any such action or proceeding and the
Shareholders will pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. If the
Shareholders do not elect to defend such third party claim or demand or does
not defend such third party claim or demand in good faith, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right, in addition to any other right or remedy it may
have hereunder, at the Shareholders' expense, to defend such third party claim
or demand; provided, however, that (i) such Indemnified Party shall not have
any obligation to participate in the defense of or defend any such
third party claim or demand; (ii) such Indemnified Party's defense of or its
participation in the defense of any such third party claim or demand shall
not in any way diminish or lessen the obligations of the Shareholders under
the agreements of indemnification set forth in this _Article VII_ ; and (iii)
such Indemnified Party may not settle any claim without the consent of the
Shareholders, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c) The Holding Company and the Shareholders, and Purchaser and the
other Indemnified Parties, if any, shall cooperate fully in all aspects of any
investigation, defense, pre-trial activities, trial, compromise, settlement
or discharge of any claim in respect of which indemnity is sought pursuant to
this _Article VII_ , including, but not limited to, by providing the other
party with reasonable access to employees and officers (including as
witnesses) and other information.

  



  

(d) Except for third party claims being defended in good faith, the
Shareholders shall satisfy their obligations under this _Article VII_ in
respect of a valid claim for indemnification hereunder that is not contested
by the Shareholders in good faith within thirty (30) days after the date on
which Notice of Claim is delivered.

  



  

7.3 Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims.

  



  

In the event any Indemnified Party should have an indemnification claim
against the Shareholders under this Agreement that does not involve a claim by
a third party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver notice of such
claim to the Shareholders in writing and in reasonable detail. The failure by
any Indemnified Party to so notify the Shareholders shall not relieve the
Shareholders from any liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party,
except to the extent that Shareholders have been actually prejudiced by such
failure. If the Shareholders do not notify the Indemnified Party within
fifteen (15) Business Days following its receipt of such notice that
the Shareholders dispute such claim, such claim specified by the Shareholders
in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Shareholders
under this _Article VII_ and the Shareholders shall pay the amount of such
liability to the Indemnified Party on demand, or in the case of any notice in
which the amount of the claim is estimated, on such later date when the
amount of such claim is finally determined. If the Shareholders dispute their
liability with respect to such claim in a timely manner, the Shareholders and
the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
submitted to arbitration pursuant to _Section 9.12_.

  



  

7.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

  



  

No claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_ shall be asserted by an
Indemnified Party, and no liability for such indemnify shall be
enforced against the Shareholders, to the extent the Indemnified Party has
theretofore received indemnification or otherwise been compensated for such
Claim. In the event that an Indemnified Party shall later collect any such
amounts recovered under insurance policies with respect to any Claim for
which it has previously received payments under this _Article VII_ from the
Shareholders, such Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the Shareholders
such amount recovered; provided, however, that in no event shall the amount
repaid to the Shareholders exceed the amount paid by the Shareholders under
this _Article VII_.

7.5 Holdback of Shares.

  



  

(a) Three Hundred Seventy Five Million (375,000,000) of the Common
Stock Consideration (the " _Share Holdback_ ") shall be deposited with the
Purchaser. In the event a Claim arises pursuant to this Article VII, in
addition to any other rights Purchaser may have with respect to such Claim,
Purchaser shall have the right to apply the amount of the Claim against the
Share Holdback. The distribution of the Share Holdback shall be administered
by a committee of the Board of Directors of the Purchaser consisting of
solely directors with no affiliation with the Shareholders or interest in the
Holdback Shares (the " _Committee_ ")

  



  

(b) Upon resolution of any Claim in favor of an Indemnified Party, a
portion of the Share Holdback equal in value to the value of the
resolved Claim shall be released by the Committee to the applicable
Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days of such resolution. The value
of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock included in the Share Holdback shall
be equal to eighty percent (80%) of the twenty (20) day Weighted Average
Price of such Common Stock.

  



  

(c) The balance of the Share Holdback shall be released by the
Committee, pursuant to the terms of this _Section 7.5_ , on the twelve (12)
month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Share
Holdback shall continue to be held by the Purchaser to satisfy Unresolved
Claims that remain outstanding as of the twenty four (24) month anniversary of
the Closing Date as and when such claims are finally resolved. Common Stock
Consideration shall be disbursed by the Committee to the Indemnified Parties
from the Share Holdback, from time to time, as Unresolved Claims are resolved.
Shareholders, the Holding Company and the Purchaser shall act in good faith
and cooperate fully so as to resolve the Unresolved Claims and to instruct the
Committee regarding the disbursement of the Common Stock Consideration that
remain subject to the Share Holdback.

  



  

7.6 Exclusive Remedy.

  



  

The indemnification provisions of this _Article VII_ (i) shall, in the case
of the representatives and warranties, be the exclusive remedy following
the Closing with respect to breaches thereof, (ii) shall apply without regard
to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation by reason of set-off,
limitation or otherwise, and (iii) are intended to be comprehensive and not to
be limited by any requirements of law concerning prominence of language or
waiver of any legal right under any law (including, without limitation, rights
under any workers compensation statute or similar statute conferring immunity
from suit). The obligations of the parties set forth in this Article VII
shall be conditioned upon the Closing having occurred.
