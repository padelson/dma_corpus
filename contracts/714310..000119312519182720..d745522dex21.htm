ARTICLE II. - CONVERSION OF ORITANI COMMON STOCK AND OPTIONS

 

2.1 Conversion of Oritani Common Stock; Exchange Ratio; Cash in Lieu of
Fractional Shares.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Section
2.1 and Section 2.2, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share,
of Oritani (" _Oritani Common_

 



2

    

  _Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Excluded Shares (as hereinafter defined) and including all
unvested restricted stock awards), shall by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Oritani, Valley or the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding and shall be converted into and become the right to receive that
number of shares of common stock, no par value, of Valley (" _Valley Common
Stock_ ") equal to the Exchange Ratio (as hereinafter defined). No fractional
shares of Valley Common Stock will be issued, and in lieu thereof, at the
Effective Time each holder of Oritani Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fractional interest of Valley Common Stock will receive an
amount in cash determined by multiplying such fractional interest by the
Average Closing Price as defined below. For purposes of this Section 2.1, the
following terms shall have the following meanings:

(A) " _Average Closing Price_ " shall mean the average of the closing-
sale prices of Valley Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("
_NASDAQ_ ") as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets for the five (5) full
Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date.

(B) " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean 1.60. 

(C) " _Trading Day_ " shall mean a day for which a closing price of a share
of Valley Common Stock on NASDAQ is reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets.

(b) At the Effective Time, all shares of Oritani Common Stock held by
Oritani in its treasury or owned by Valley or by any of Valleys Subsidiaries
(other than shares held as trustee or in a fiduciary capacity and shares held
as collateral on or in lieu of a debt previously contracted) (" _Excluded
Shares_ ") shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no Merger
Consideration (as hereinafter defined) shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

(d) On and after the Effective Time, holders of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Oritani Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ "), it being understood that any
reference herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include reference to
book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Oritani
Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of Oritani,
except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 2.1
for each such share held by them. The Valley Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, which any one Oritani shareholder may receive pursuant to
this Section 2.1 is referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_ " and
the total number of shares of Valley Common Stock, plus any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which all of Oritani shareholders are entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 2.1 is referred to herein as the " _Aggregate Merger
Consideration_ ".

 

(e) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if, during the
period from the date hereof to the Effective Time, the shares of Valley
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be
declared with a record date within said period, appropriate adjustments shall
be made to the Exchange Ratio to provide the Oritani shareholders with the
equivalent value of the Merger Consideration set forth in this Section 2.1.

 



3

    

2.2 Exchange of Shares.

 

(a) Oritani and Valley hereby appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for purposes of
effecting the conversion of Oritani Common Stock. Not later than five (5)
business days after the Effective Time, Valley shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of Oritani Common Stock as of the Effective
Time (a " _Record Holder_ ") a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent),
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1 hereof.

 

(b) Upon surrender of Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
executed, the Record Holder shall be entitled to promptly, but in no event
later than five (5) business days, receive in exchange for such Certificates
the Merger Consideration which such Record Holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof. Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled.
As soon as practicable, but no later than five (5) business days following
receipt of the properly completed letter of transmittal and any necessary
accompanying documentation, Valley shall cause the Exchange Agent to
distribute the Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated
to deliver or cause to be delivered to any Record Holder the consideration to
which such Record Holder would otherwise be entitled until such Record Holder
surrenders the Certificates for exchange or, in default thereof, an
appropriate Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity Agreement and bond in such
reasonable amount as may be required in each case by Valley. Notwithstanding
the time of surrender of the Certificates, Record Holders shall be deemed
shareholders of Valley for all purposes from the Effective Time, except that
Valley shall withhold the payment of dividends from any Record Holder until
such Record Holder effects the exchange of Certificates for Valley Common
Stock. Such Record Holder shall receive such withheld dividends, without
interest, upon effecting the share exchange.

 

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Oritani of the shares of Oritani Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and, if any Certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the consideration as provided in Section 2.1 hereof.

(d) If payment of the consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof is to be
made in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that
the Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a person other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

 

(e) Valley and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon Oritanis
stock transfer books to establish the identity of those persons entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with

 



4

    

 respect to ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, Valley and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration or
dividends or distributions thereon represented thereby in escrow with an
independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims
thereto.

 

(f) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Valley shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of Oritani Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2,
certificates (or other electronic evidence) representing the shares of Valley
Common Stock to be issued to Oritani shareholders as part of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration plus the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Valley
Common Stock.

 

2.3 Treatment of Oritani Stock Options and Restricted Stock.

 

(a) All options which may be exercised for issuance of Oritani Common Stock
(each, a " _Oritani Stock Option_ " and collectively the " _Oritani Stock
Options_ ") are described in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ and are issued
and outstanding pursuant to the Oritani stock plans described in the
_Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ (collectively, the " _Oritani Stock Plans_ ")
and the forms of agreements pursuant to which such Oritani Stock Options were
granted (each, an " _Option Grant Agreement_ ").

 

(b) At the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and adopt each of the
Oritani Stock Plans and all of the rights, powers, discretions, obligations
and duties of Oritani thereunder, and each outstanding Oritani Stock Option
granted to an eligible individual under any Oritani Stock Plan shall vest only
to the extent set forth in the relevant Oritani Stock Plan and Option Grant
Agreement, and be converted into an option to purchase Valley Common Stock (a
" _Valley Stock Option_ "), wherein (x) the number of shares of Valley Common
Stock subject to the Valley Stock Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of Oritani Common Stock subject to the Oritani Stock Option multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the next whole share), and (y) the
exercise price per share of Valley Common Stock subject to the Valley Stock
Option shall be equal to the option exercise price per share of Oritani
Common Stock subject to the Oritani Stock Option that is being converted
divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the next whole cent) and (z) in
all other respects the Oritani Stock Option shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the applicable Oritani Stock Plan and the relevant Option Grant
Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and for any
options which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code), the adjustments shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner
which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. Shares of Valley Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of Stock Options shall be covered by an
effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or, to the extent that Form S-8
is not available for such purpose, an effective registration statement on
Form S-3 or another available form), and Valley shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or other available form) covering such shares as soon
as practicable, and in any event within five (5) business days, after the
Effective Time. Concurrently with, or as soon as practicable following, the
execution of this Agreement, Valley shall reserve, from its authorized but
unissued or treasury shares, a sufficient number of shares of Valley Common
Stock to provide for the shares issuable upon exercise of the Valley Stock
Options.

 



5

    

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, each share of Oritani restricted
stock (" _Oritani Restricted Stock_ ") under a Oritani Stock Plan which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of this
Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become
vested only to the extent set forth under the relevant Oritani Stock Plan and
award agreement for such Oritani Restricted Stock and shall be converted into
the right to receive, at the Effective Time, and without duplication,
the same consideration as holders of Oritani Common Stock are receiving in

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Oritani has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing would not
have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Oritani. Oritani is registered as
a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners Loan Act, as
amended.

(b) All of the Subsidiaries of Oritani are listed in the _Oritani
Disclosure Schedule_ with a designation of which Subsidiaries are Significant

limited liability company or other entity of which at least a majority of the

laws of its state of incorporation or organization. The Bank is a savings bank
chartered under the laws of the State of New Jersey whose deposits are insured

extent permitted by law. Each Significant

 Subsidiary of Oritani has the power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted in all material respects and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure of each of the foregoing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Oritani. The _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth true and complete copies
of the certificate of incorporation, articles of association, bylaws or
other comparable formation and governing documents of Oritani, the Bank, each
Oritani Significant Subsidiary and the Oritani Bank Charitable Foundation (the

Oritani Stock Plans, there were no shares of Oritani Common Stock issuable

employee equity awards. All issued and outstanding shares of Oritani Common
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid, and
nonassessable. The authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 2,000,000
shares of common stock, $2.00 par value per share. As of the date hereof,
there were 250,000 shares of the Bank common stock outstanding. Except as set
forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , neither Oritani nor any Oritani
Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
transfer, purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock of Oritani or
any Oritani Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase
or otherwise receive any shares of such capital stock or any securities
convertible into or representing the right to purchase or subscribe for any
such shares, and there are no agreements or understandings with respect to
voting of any such shares.

(b) The _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ contains a list setting forth as of

vested, and the price at which each such option may be exercised and (ii)
comparable information for any other outstanding awards under the Oritani
Stock Plans or otherwise, including, without limitation, Oritani Restricted

Oritani Stock Option is not less than the fair market value of a share of
Oritani Common Stock as determined on the date of grant of such Oritani Stock
Option and within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and associated
guidance set forth by the United States Department of the Treasury. Oritani

in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of ERISA, the Code,
all regulations, rulings and announcements promulgated or issued thereunder,
and all other applicable governmental laws and regulations. Furthermore, the
IRS has issued a favorable determination or opinion letter, which takes into
account the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act and (to the
extent it mandates currently applicable requirements) subsequent legislation,
with respect to each of the Oritani Pension Plans, and Oritani has no
knowledge of any fact or circumstance which could lead to the
disqualification of any such plan).

(e) To Oritanis knowledge, except as disclosed on the  _Oritani

15

    

(i) Except as disclosed in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , there are
no funding obligations of any Oritani Benefit Plan which are not accounted for
by reserves shown on the Oritani Financial Statements and established under
GAAP, or otherwise noted on the Oritani Financial Statements.

 

(j) Except as disclosed in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , with respect
to each Oritani Pension Plan and Oritani Welfare Plan that is funded wholly
or partially through an insurance policy, there will be no liability of
Oritani or any Oritani Subsidiary under any such insurance policy or ancillary
agreement with respect to such insurance policy for any retroactive rate
adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or contingent contractual
liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring prior to or at
the Effective Time.

 

(k) Except as may hereafter be expressly agreed to by Valley in writing or
as disclosed on the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with its terms will
not (i) entitle any current or former employee of Oritani or any Oritani
Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any similar
payment, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment, accelerate the vesting, or
increase the amount, of any compensation or benefits due to any current
employee or former employee under any Oritani Pension Plan, Oritani Welfare
Plan, or Oritani Benefit Plan.

(l) Except for the Oritani Pension Plans and the Oritani Welfare Plans, and
except as set forth on the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , Oritani has no
deferred compensation agreements, understandings or obligations for payments
or benefits to any current or former director, officer or employee of Oritani
or any Oritani Subsidiary or any predecessor of any of them. The _Oritani
Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth (or lists, if previously delivered to Valley
with respect to such items and any supplemental retirement plan or
arrangement): (i) true and complete copies of the deferred compensation
agreements, understandings or obligations with respect to each such current or
former director, officer or employee, (ii) the most recent actuarial or other
calculation of the present value of such payments or benefits, and (iii)
whether the financial statements provide a reserve for such items on the

(m) Except as set forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , Oritani does
not maintain or otherwise pay for life insurance policies (other than group
term life policies on employees) with respect to any director, officer or
employee. The _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ lists each such insurance policy
and any agreement with a party other than the insurer with respect to the
payment, funding or assignment of such policy. Such life insurance policies
comply, in all material respects, with state and federal law, including,
without limitation, ERISA, and the rules and regulations of all
applicable Governmental Entities. To Oritanis knowledge, neither Oritani nor
any Oritani Pension Plan or Oritani Welfare Plan owns any individual or group
insurance policies issued by an insurer which has been found to be insolvent
or is in rehabilitation pursuant to a state proceeding.

(n) Except as set forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , Oritani
does not maintain any retirement plan for directors. The _Oritani Disclosure

any) of any such plan and the reserve on the Oritani Financial Statements for
such plan.

 



16

    

(o) Except as set forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , Neither
Oritani nor any Oritani Subsidiary (i) has entered into a nonqualified
deferred compensation arrangement with the meaning of Section 409A of the
Code, or has failed to take any other action, that has resulted or could
result in the interest and Tax penalties specified in Section 409A of the
Code being owed by any employee, former employee, director, former director or
beneficiary or (ii) has agreed to reimburse or indemnify any employee, former
employee, director, former director or beneficiary for any of the interest
and Tax penalties specified in Section 409A of the Code that may be currently
due or payable in the future.

 

(p) Except as disclosed in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule,_ or as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on Oritani, since January 1, 2018, neither
Oritani nor any of its Subsidiaries have made any payments to employees which
are not deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code.

 

(q) Other than as identified on the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , Oritani
maintains no split dollar life insurance for the benefit of any executive.
The _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ contains a copy of each split dollar life
insurance policy and the relevant consents for each person previously a
beneficiary or owner of all or a portion of such policies.

3.10 Reports. Except as set forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ ,
the Bank has, since January 1, 2017, duly filed with the NJDOBI and the FDIC,
and Oritani has duly filed with the FRB, in correct form all documentation
required to be filed under applicable laws and regulations, and if requested
by Valley, Oritani promptly will deliver or make available to Valley accurate
and complete copies of such documentation. The _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_
lists all examinations of the Bank conducted by the NJDOBI and the FDIC, and
all examinations of Oritani conducted by the FRB, since January 1, 2017 and
the dates of any responses thereto submitted by the Bank and Oritani,
respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 3.10 or
this Agreement shall require Oritani to provide Valley with any confidential
regulatory supervisory information of Oritani or the Bank.

 

3.11 Compliance with Applicable Law.

 

(a) Except as set forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , each of
Oritani and the Oritani Subsidiaries (i) holds all licenses, franchises,
permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of its business,
except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or
authorization would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Oritani, and (ii) has complied with and is not in
default in any respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule,
regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to
Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, consumer,
community and fair lending laws, other than where any non-compliance or
default would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on Oritani and neither
Oritani nor any of the Oritani Subsidiaries, since January 1, 2017, has
received written notice of such violation of any of the above that has not
been cured.

 



17

    

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Bank has complied in all material
respects with the Community Reinvestment Act (" _CRA_ "). Except as set forth
on the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , since January 1, 2017, to Oritanis
knowledge, no third-party person or group has adversely commented upon the
Banks CRA performance.

(c) To the knowledge of Oritani, there is no reason why the granting of
any of the necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations by the
governmental bodies necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement would be denied or unduly delayed.

 

3.12 Certain Contracts.

Subsidiaries in the principal amount of $750,000 or more, including any sale
and leaseback transactions in the ordinary course of its business consistent
with past practice, capitalized leases and other similar financing
transactions, (iii) which grants any right of first refusal, right of first
offer or similar right with respect to any material assets or properties of

more to be made by Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries upon a change in control
thereof, (v) which involves products or services purchased or to be purchased
by Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries with an annual value in excess of

or less notice or which could reasonably be expected to involve payments by,
or to, Oritani, during fiscal year 2019 of more than $750,000 and not
terminable on ninety (90) days or less notice (other than pursuant to Loans
originated or purchased by Oritani and its Subsidiaries in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). Each contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section
3.12(a) or set forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , is referred to
herein as a " _Oritani Contract_."

(b) Except as set forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , (i) each
Oritani Contract is valid and binding on Oritani or its applicable Subsidiary
and in full force and effect, and, to the knowledge of Oritani, is valid and
binding on the other parties thereto, (ii) Oritani and each of
its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Oritani, each of the other parties
thereto, has in all material respects performed all obligations required to be
performed by such party to date under

 



18

    

 each Oritani Contract, and (iii) no event or condition exists which
constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material breach or default on the part of Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries
or, to the knowledge of Oritani, any other party thereto, under any such
Oritani Contract, except, in each case, where such invalidity, failure to be
binding, failure to so perform or breach or default, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Oritani.

 

(c) The _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ contains a schedule showing the
present value of the monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in
such schedule and the most recently available valuation report, whether
individually or in the aggregate (including good faith estimates of all
amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date of
this Agreement, such as Tax indemnification payments in respect of income or
excise Taxes), under any employment, change-in-control, severance or similar
contract or plan with or which covers any present or former employee,
director or consultant of Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries and identifying
the types and estimated amounts of the in-kind benefits due under any
Oritani Pension Plans, Oritani Welfare Plans or Oritani Contract (other than
a Tax-qualified plan) for each such person, specifying the assumptions in such
schedule. The failure of Oritani to include immaterial amounts (both
individually or in the aggregate) under Section 3.12(c) shall not constitute a
breach thereof.

 

3.13 Properties and Insurance.

 

(a) The _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ contains a complete list of all real
property owned (" _Oritani Owned Real Property_ ") or leased by Oritani or
any of its Subsidiaries, as other real estate owned (" _OREO_ ") or otherwise,
or owned, leased or controlled by Oritani or any Oritani Subsidiary as trustee
or fiduciary (collectively, the " _Oritani Properties_ "). To Oritanis
knowledge, and except as set forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ ,
Oritani and its Subsidiaries have good, and as to Oritani Owned Real
Property, marketable and fee simple, title to all material assets and
properties, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, reflected in
Oritanis consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2018, or owned and
acquired subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets and
properties have been disposed of for fair value in the ordinary course of
business since June 30, 2018 to third parties in arms length transactions).

 

(b) Oritani and its Subsidiaries as lessees have the right under valid and
subsisting leases to occupy, use, possess and control all property leased by
them in all material respects as presently occupied, used, possessed and
controlled by them. The _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ lists all leases
pursuant to which Oritani or any Oritani Subsidiary occupies any real
property (" _Oritani Leases_ ") and for each such lease lists annual base
rentals, the annual increases to base rentals to the end of the lease and the
expiration date and any option terms. Except as otherwise set forth on the
_Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , the Merger does not or will not trigger any
provision of any of the Oritani Leases covering Oritanis leased real property
which would require the consent to assignment or approval by any of the
lessors thereunder. Neither Oritani nor its Subsidiaries have assigned,
subleased, transferred, conveyed, mortgaged or deeded in trust any interest in
any of the Oritani Leases. Neither Oritani nor any of its Subsidiaries have
received written notice of any threatened cancellations of any of the Oritani
Leases. Oritani or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has in all material
respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date
pursuant to such Oritani Leases. Neither Oritani nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notice of any default or event that with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by Oritani or any
Subsidiary under any of the Oritani Leases.

 



19

    

(c) To Oritanis knowledge, the Oritani Properties and all buildings and
improvements thereon are free from any material interior or exterior
structural defects. Neither Oritani nor its Subsidiaries have received written
notice that any such buildings, structures, fixtures and improvements on any
Oritani Owned Real Property are in violation, in any material respect, of any
applicable laws. To Oritanis knowledge, the buildings, structures, fixtures
and improvements on each parcel of Oritani Owned Real Property lie entirely
within the boundaries of such parcel of Oritani Owned Real Property. Neither
Oritani nor its Subsidiaries have received written notice that any portion of
Oritani Properties or any building, structure, fixture or improvement thereon
is the subject of, or affected by, any condemnation, eminent domain or
inverse condemnation proceeding currently instituted or pending, and to the
knowledge of Oritani, none of the foregoing are, or have been threatened to
be, the subject of, or affected by, any such proceeding. There are no persons
other than Oritani and its Subsidiaries, or, to Oritanis knowledge as to
leased real property, the landlord (to the extent provided for in the relevant
Oritani Lease), entitled to possession of the Oritani Owned Real Property. To
Oritanis knowledge, all of the Oritani Properties, and Oritanis and its
Subsidiaries use thereof, complies in all material respects with all
applicable zoning, building, fire, use restriction, air, water or other
pollution control, environmental protection, waste disposal, safety or health
codes, or other ordinances, rules or regulations but excluding any
Environmental Laws which are subject to Section 3.15 hereof. Except as set
forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ , neither Oritani nor its
Subsidiaries have received any notification of any asserted present or past
failure by it to comply with such laws, rules, regulations or codes, or such
orders, rules, writs, judgments, injunctions, decrees or ordinances except
for past violations as to which the relevant statute of limitations has
expired or as to which Oritani or its Subsidiaries have completed all actions
required to be in compliance therewith.

 

(d) The _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ lists all material policies of
insurance of Oritani and its Significant Subsidiaries, in each case under
valid, binding and enforceable policies or bonds, with such amounts and such
deductibles as are specified. As of the date hereof, neither Oritani nor any

of a pending material amendment of any such insurance policy or bond or is in
default under such policy or bond, no material coverage thereunder is being
disputed and all material claims thereunder have been filed in a
timely fashion.

3.14 Minute Books. Since January 1, 2017, the minute books of Oritani and
its Significant Subsidiaries contain records that are accurate in all
material respects of all meetings of and other corporate action taken by their
respective shareholders and Boards of Directors (including committees of their
respective Boards of Directors).

or otherwise, (iii) neither Oritani nor any Oritani Subsidiary has received
any written notice, citation, claim, assessment, proposed assessment or demand

in-interest in connection with the enforcement of remedies to realize the
value of properties serving as collateral for outstanding loans) may be in
violation of any Environmental Law or may have any liability under any
Environmental Law, and (iv) no toxic or hazardous substances or materials have
been emitted, generated, disposed of or stored on any Oritani Property in any

that it is or could be liable for remedial actions of such location pursuant
to Environmental Laws.

 

(e) Oritani and its Subsidiaries have furnished to Valley copies of all
environmental assessments, reports, audits and other documents in their

or obtained knowledge of any material written complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of

controls including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that
Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or

Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries,

(x) make any material change in its accounting methods or practices, other
than changes required in accordance with GAAP or any applicable regulatory

(xi) take any action that would result in any of the representations and

satisfied;

(xii) make or commit to make any new loan or other extension of credit in
an amount of $15,000,000 or more;

(b) Valley agrees that from the date hereof to the Effective Time, except
as otherwise approved by Oritani in writing (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as permitted or required by
this Agreement, it will not, nor will it permit any of its Significant
Subsidiaries to:

 

(i) change any provision of the Valley Charter Documents in a manner that
would require the approval of the shareholders of Valley other than an
increase in its authorized capital stock;

(ii) make any material change in its accounting methods or practices, other
than changes required in accordance with GAAP or any applicable regulatory
accounting requirements;

(iii) take any action that would result in any of the representations and

correct in any material respect at the Effective Time or that would result in
any of its conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.3 not to be
satisfied;

(iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

5.3 No Solicitation. (a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3,
Oritani and its Subsidiaries shall not, and Oritani and its Subsidiaries
shall use their best efforts to cause their respective representatives not to
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate inquiries or proposals
with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions
with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter
defined); provided that in the event, prior to the time the approval of
Oritanis shareholders (" _Oritani Shareholder Approval_ ") is obtained but
not after, (1) Oritani receives, after the execution of this Agreement, an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal from a person other than Valley,
and (2) the Oritani Board of Directors concludes in good faith (A) that, after
consulting with its financial advisor, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or would reasonably be likely to
result in a Superior Proposal and (B) that, after considering the advice of
outside counsel, failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to Oritanis shareholders under applicable law, Oritani may,
and may permit its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries representatives to,
furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate
in negotiations or discussions with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
provided, that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into an
agreement with such third party on terms substantially similar to and no more
favorable to such third party than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement between Valley and Oritani dated May 8, 2019 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and any non-public information provided to any person given
access to nonpublic information shall have previously been provided to Valley
or shall be provided to Valley prior to or concurrently with the time it is
provided to such person. Oritani will (A) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any persons other than Valley with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, (B) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal to which it or any of its affiliates or representatives
is a party and (C) use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



44

    

(b) Neither the Oritani Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall
(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Valley) or
refuse to make the Oritani Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve, recommend,
endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition
Proposal, or (ii) cause or permit Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or
related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by the
terms of Section 5.3(a) of this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the date of the Oritani Shareholders Meeting, the Oritani Board of
Directors may take any of the actions specified in items (i) and (ii) of the
preceding sentence (a " _Oritani Subsequent Determination_ ") after the
second (2nd) business day following Valleys receipt of a written notice (the
" _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from Oritani (A) advising that the Oritani
Board of Directors has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.3 or from an action by a representative of Oritani or its
Subsidiaries that would have been such a breach if committed by Oritani or
its Subsidiaries) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that
Oritani shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in
respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or
its affiliates that Oritani proposes to accept), (B) specifying the material
terms and conditions of, and the identity of the party making, such Superior
Proposal, and (C) containing an unredacted copy of the relevant transactions
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal, if, but only if, (X)
Valley does not make, after being provided with reasonable opportunity to
negotiate with Oritani, within two (2) business days of receipt of a Notice of
Superior Proposal, a written offer that the Board of Directors of Oritani
determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal no
longer being a Superior Proposal, and (Y) the Oritani Board of Directors
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
the failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to Oritanis shareholders under applicable law and that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has
been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal
after taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that
are committed to in writing by Valley pursuant to this Section 5.3(b).

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the
Oritani Recommendation or the making of a Oritani Subsequent Determination by
the Oritani Board of Directors shall not change the approval of the Oritani
Board of Directors for purposes of causing any takeover laws to be
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Oritani set forth in Sections 5.3(a)
and (b) of this Agreement, in the event Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries or
representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for
non-public information or to engage in negotiations that the Oritani
directors believe is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates an
Acquisition Proposal, Oritani promptly (and in any event within two business
days of receipt) shall advise 

 



45

    

 Valley in writing of the existence of the matters described in this clause
(i) or (ii), together with the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity of the person making any
such Acquisition Proposal or request. Oritani shall keep Valley reasonably
well informed in all material respects of the status (including after the
occurrence of any material amendment or modification) of any such Acquisition
Proposal or request. Without limiting any of the foregoing, Oritani shall
promptly (and in any event within two business days) notify Valley in writing
if it determines to begin providing non-public information or to engage in
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Sections 5.3(a) or
(b) of this Agreement and shall in no event begin providing such information
or engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such
notice.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement: 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, a tender or exchange offer to acquire 25% or
more of the voting power in Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries, a proposal for
a merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving Oritani or
any of its Subsidiaries or any other proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner 25% or more of the voting power in, or 25% or more of the business,
assets or deposits of, Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of
such term changed from 25% to 50%) that the Oritani Board of Directors
concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to
its shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby (including taking into account any adjustment to the terms and
conditions proposed by Valley in response to such proposal pursuant to Section
5.3(b) of this Agreement or otherwise), (1) after receiving the advice of its
financial advisor (which shall be a nationally recognized investment banking
firm), (2) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such
transaction on the terms set forth therein (as compared to, and with due
regard for, the terms herein), and (3) after taking into account all legal
(with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms
of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and
any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law.

(e) Other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (which shall be
subject to Section 5.3(a) and 5.3(b), and shall not be subject to this Section
5.3(e)), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict Oritanis Board
of Directors from, prior to the receipt of the Oritani Shareholder Approval,
effecting a Oritani Subsequent Determination if Oritanis Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with Oritanis outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of Oritanis Board of
Directors to effect a Oritani Subsequent Determination would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

 

5.4 Current Information. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, Oritani will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of Valley regarding Oritanis business, operations,
properties, assets and financial condition and matters relating to the
completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the
foregoing, Oritani shall provide Valley, on

 



46

    

 a monthly basis, with (i) financial statements, (ii) a list of securities
purchased, (iii) monthly advances, and (iv) a schedule of all new loans,
leases, extensions of credit, and renewal loans, leases and extensions of
credit in excess of $1,000,000, or any increase by $1,000,000 or more in any
customers aggregate credit outstanding or lease commitment (whether or not
subject to prior approval under Section 5.2(a)), and provide Valley with a
copy of, and the opportunity to discuss, the relevant documentation for any
such loan, extension of credit, lease, or renewal upon request.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, neither
Valley nor any Valley Subsidiary shall under any circumstance be permitted to
exercise control of Oritani or any Oritani Subsidiary prior to the Effective
Time. As soon as reasonably available, but in no event more than thirty-two
(32) days after the end of each fiscal quarter ending after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Oritani will deliver to Valley the
Banks call reports filed with the FDIC.

5.5 Access to Properties and Records; Confidentiality.

 

(a) On reasonable advance notice, Oritani and the Bank shall permit Valley
and its representatives, and Valley and VNB shall permit Oritani and its
representatives, accompanied by an officer of the respective party, reasonable
access during normal business hours to their respective properties, and shall
make available to Valley and its representatives or Oritani and its
representatives as the case may be, all books, papers and records relating to
their respective assets, stock ownership, properties, operations, obligations
and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of account
(including the general ledger), Tax records, minute books of directors and
shareholders meetings, charter documents, material contracts and agreements,
filings with any regulatory authority, independent auditors work papers
(subject to the receipt by such auditors of a standard access representation
letter), litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any other business
activities or prospects in which Valley and its representatives or Oritani and
its representatives may have a reasonable interest. Neither party shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would or would reasonably be expected to violate or prejudice the
rights of any customer, violate the terms of any contract, jeopardize
attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order or
judgment. The parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. Oritani acknowledges that Valley may be involved in
discussions concerning potential acquisitions of banks and other entities and
Valley shall not be obligated to disclose such information to Oritani except
as such information is publicly disclosed by Valley.

(b) Each party will hold any information that is confidential, proprietary
or otherwise non-public in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

5.6 Regulatory Matters.

 

(a) For the purposes of holding the Oritani Shareholders Meeting and the
Valley Shareholders Meeting (each as defined in Section 5.7) and qualifying
under applicable federal and state securities laws the Valley Common Stock to
be issued to Oritani shareholders in connection with the Merger, as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days following the date of
this Agreement, the parties shall (i) jointly prepare, and Valley shall file
with the SEC, a Registration Statement on Form S-4, including a prospectus and
(ii) jointly prepare, and Valley shall file with the

 



47

    

 SEC, a proxy statement, satisfying all applicable requirements of applicable
state and federal laws, including the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
applicable state securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder
(such proxy statement and prospectus in the form mailed by Valley and Oritani
to its respective shareholders together with any and all amendments or
supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the " _Joint Proxy
Statement-Prospectus_ " and the various documents to be filed by Valley under
the Securities Act with the SEC to register the Valley Common Stock for sale,
including the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus, are referred to herein as the
" _Registration Statement_ "). Prior to the filing of the Joint Proxy
Statement-Prospectus and the Registration Statement, each party shall consult
with the other party with respect to such filings and shall afford the other
party and their representatives reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

(b) Each party shall furnish to the other party with such information
concerning itself and its affiliates as is necessary in order to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus and Registration Statement to comply with
Section 5.6(a) hereof. Each party agrees promptly to advise the other party
if at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information provided by such
party in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or Registration Statement
becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material respect and promptly to
provide the information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission. Each
party shall promptly furnish to the other party such supplemental information
as may be necessary in order to cause the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus
or Registration Statement to comply with Section 5.6(a) hereof. The
information relating to a party to be provided for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or Registration
Statement, any filing pursuant to Rule 165 or Rule 425 under the Securities
Act, or in any other document filed with any other Governmental Entity in
connection herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

(c) Valley shall as promptly as practicable make such filings, if any, as
are necessary in connection with the offering of the Valley Common Stock with
applicable state securities agencies and shall use all reasonable efforts to
qualify the offering of such stock under applicable state securities laws at
the earliest practicable date. Oritani shall promptly furnish Valley with such
information regarding Oritani shareholders as Valley requires to enable it to
determine what filings are required hereunder. Oritani authorizes Valley to
utilize in such filings the information concerning Oritani and the Bank
provided to Valley in connection with, or contained in, the Joint Proxy
Statement-Prospectus. Valley shall furnish Oritanis counsel with copies of
all such filings and keep Oritani advised of the status thereof. Valley shall
promptly notify Oritani of all communications, oral or written, with the SEC
concerning the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement-
Prospectus.

 

(d) Valley shall cause the Valley Common Stock issuable pursuant to the
Merger (including shares of Valley Common Stock to be reserved for issuance
upon the exercise of Valley Stock Options), to be listed on NASDAQ at the
Effective Time.

 

(e) The parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use all
reasonable efforts to prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all
necessary filings and to obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and governmental bodies necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
possible, including, without limitation, those required by the OCC, the FRB,
NASDAQ, the Department of Treasury of

 



48

    

 the State of New Jersey and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
The parties shall each have the right to review in advance and comment on all
information relating to the other, as the case may be, which appears in any
filing made with, or written material submitted to, any third party or
governmental body in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Valley and VNB shall use their best efforts to cause their
applications to the OCC and the application or waiver request to the FRB to be
filed within sixty (60) days of the date of this Agreement. Oritani shall
cooperate with Valley to provide all information requested in writing by
Valley to complete such application within ten (10) days of request from
Valley. Valley shall provide to Oritani drafts of all filings and applications
referred to in this Section 5.6(e) and shall give Oritani the opportunity to
comment thereon prior to their filing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to require Valley or Oritani to take any
action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of governmental entities that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Valley following the merger,
taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger (a " _Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ "). In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, each of Valley and Oritani shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, and cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to, (i)
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable law so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Valley or Oritani to take
any actions specified in this Section 5.6(e) that would reasonably be
expected to constitute or result in a Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition.

 

(f) Each of the parties will promptly furnish each other with copies of
written communications received by them or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental
Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(g) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Oritani
shall cooperate with Valley, consistent with legal requirements, to prepare
and assist for the prompt conversion of Oritanis systems and procedures post-
closing and other post-closing merger integration.

 

(h) Oritani acknowledges that Valley is in or may be in the process of
acquiring other bank holding companies, banks, financial institutions, and/or
other entities and that in connection with other acquisitions, information
concerning Oritani may be required to be included in the registration
statements, if any, for the issuance of securities of Valley or in
Valley Reports in connection with other acquisitions. Oritani agrees to
provide Valley with any information, certificates, documents or other
materials about Oritani as are reasonably necessary to be included in such
other SEC reports or registration statements, including the Registration
Statement referenced in Section 5.6(a) and any other registration statements
which may be filed by Valley prior to the Effective Time. Oritani shall use
its reasonable efforts to cause its attorneys and accountants to provide
Valley and any underwriters for Valley with any consents, opinion letters,
reports or information which are necessary to complete the registration
statements and applications for any other acquisition or issuance
of securities. Valley shall reimburse Oritani for all expenses reasonably
incurred by Oritani related to another acquisition by Valley. Valley shall not
file with the SEC any registration statement or amendment or supplement
containing information regarding Oritani unless Oritani shall have consented
to the disclosure contained in the filing, which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed or withheld.

 



49

    

5.7 Approval of Shareholders.

 

(a) The Oritani Board of Directors will, subject to the qualification set
forth in Section 5.3(b) hereof, take all steps necessary to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders of Oritani (such
meeting or any adjournment thereof, the " _Oritani Shareholders Meeting_ ")
for the purpose of securing the approval of the shareholders of Oritani of
the Merger and this Agreement and use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to obtain, as promptly as practicable, such approval. Oritani and Valley will
cooperate with respect to each of the foregoing matters. Contemporaneously
with the execution of this Agreement, Oritani shall cause each of the
directors of Oritani in their capacity as shareholders to execute and deliver
to Valley a Voting Agreement.

 

(b) The Valley Board of Directors shall (i) take all steps necessary to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders of
Valley (such meeting or any adjournment thereof, the " _Valley Shareholders
Meeting_ ") for the purpose of securing the approval of the shareholders of
Valley of the issuance of shares of Valley Common Stock in connection with
the Merger and this Agreement and use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to obtain, as promptly as practicable, such approval and (ii) recommend to the
shareholders of Valley the approval of such stock issuance. Oritani and
Valley will cooperate with respect to each of the foregoing matters.

 

5.8 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to satisfy the conditions to the Closing and
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, using reasonable efforts to lift or
rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting
the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and using its best efforts to prevent the breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such party contained or
referred to in this Agreement and to promptly remedy the same. In case at any
time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action. Nothing in
this section shall be construed to require any party to participate in any
threatened or actual legal, administrative or other proceedings (other than
proceedings, actions or investigations to which it is otherwise a party or
subject or threatened to be made a party or subject) in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless such
party shall consent in advance and in writing to such participation and the
other party agrees to reimburse and indemnify such party for and against any
and all costs and damages related thereto.

 

5.9 Public Announcements. Oritani and Valley will consult with each other
before issuing, and will cooperate with each other in the development and
distribution of, all press releases and any other public disclosure with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
will not issue any press release or written statement for general circulation
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or make any such public
statements without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld; 

 



50

    

  _provided, however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other party (but after consultation with the other party), issue such press
release or public statements as may be required by applicable law or the
rules and regulations of any stock exchange.

5.10 Failure to Fulfill Conditions. In the event that Valley or Oritani
determines that a material condition to its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or prior to April 30,
2020 (the " _Cutoff Date_ ") and that it will not waive that condition, it
will promptly notify the other party. Oritani and Valley will promptly inform
the other of any facts applicable to Oritani or Valley, respectively, or their
respective directors or officers, that would be likely to prevent or
materially delay approval of the Merger by any Governmental Entity or which
would otherwise prevent or materially delay completion of the Merger.

 

5.11 Disclosure Delivery and Disclosure Supplements. From time to time
prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto will promptly supplement or
amend (by written notice to the other) its respective disclosure schedules
delivered pursuant hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising which,
if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth or described in such schedules or which is
necessary to correct any information in such schedules which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby. If the disclosure contained in any
such supplement (i) relates to events occurring before the execution of this
Agreement or (ii) alone or together with other supplements or amendments
materially adversely affects the representation to which the amendment or
supplement relates, the party receiving the amendment or supplement may
determine not to accept it as a modification of the relevant representation.
Notice of such determination, if made, shall be given by the receiving party
to the other party not later than ten (10) days after it received the
disclosure in question. If such notice is not timely given, or if the
disclosure in question did not contain any matter of the nature specified in
clause (i) or (ii) of the second preceding sentence, the relevant
representation shall be deemed modified by the disclosure in the amendment or
supplement with the same effect as though that disclosure had been included in
the relevant disclosure schedule as furnished prior to execution of this
Agreement. 

5.12 Indemnification.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, Valley shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Oritani or
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Oritani Indemnitees_ ") against any
and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, charges, expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable costs of investigation, and the
reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel and other advisers and
experts as incurred), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement, asserted against, incurred by or imposed upon any Oritani
Indemnitee by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of Oritani or its Subsidiaries, acted as a director or officer of a
third party at the request of Oritani or its Subsidiaries or acted as a
benefits plan fiduciary, in connection with, arising out of or relating to any
threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) (each a " _Claim_ " and
collectively, " _Claims_ "), including without limitation any Claim which is
based upon, arises out of or in any way relates to the Merger, this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Oritani
Indemnitees

 



51

    

 service as a member of the Board of Directors of Oritani or any of its
Subsidiaries or any committee thereof, the events leading up to the execution
of this Agreement, any statement, announcement, recommendation or
solicitation made in connection therewith or related thereto and any breach of
any duty in connection with any of the foregoing, in each case to the fullest
extent which Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, would have
been permitted under any applicable law and the Oritani Charter Documents had
the Merger not occurred (and Valley shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent so permitted); _provided, however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such six year
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and honor any
obligation of Oritani immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to
the indemnification of the Oritani Indemnitees arising out of the Oritani
Charter Documents of Oritani or arising out of any written indemnification
agreements between Oritani and such persons disclosed in the  _Oritani
Disclosure Schedule_ , as if such obligations were pursuant to a contract or
arrangement between Valley and such Oritani Indemnitees.

 

(c) In the event Valley or any of its successors or assigns (i) reorganizes
or consolidates with or merges into or enters into another business
combination transaction with any other person or entity and is not the
resulting, continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation, merger or transaction, or (ii) liquidates, dissolves
or transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision, if necessary,
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Valley assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.12.

(d) Valley shall cause Oritanis and the Banks officers and directors to
be covered, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, at Oritanis
option, under (i) Valleys then current officers and directors liability
insurance policy (providing substantially similar coverage to Oritanis and
the Banks officers and directors as such officers and directors had under
Oritanis existing policy), or (ii) an extension of Oritanis existing
officers and directors liability insurance policy or a substitute
therefor, the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no
less favorable in any material respect to covered persons than Oritanis
existing officers and directors liability insurance policy as of the date
hereof. However, Valley shall only be required to insure such persons upon
terms and for coverages substantially similar to Oritanis existing officers
and directors liability insurance, and if such coverage over a six year
period would in the aggregate cost more than 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by Oritani for such coverage, then Valley shall be required
only to obtain such coverage as may be obtained by an expenditure equal to
200% of the annual premium currently paid by Oritani for such coverage.

(e) Any Oritani Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 5.12 shall promptly notify Valley upon learning of any Claim,
but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Valley of any liability it may
have to such Oritani Indemnitee if such failure does not materially prejudice
Valley.

 



52

    

5.13 Employment and Director Matters; Other Post-Closing Items.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ ,
Valley and VNB hereby expressly agree to honor, effective from and after the
Effective Time, each of the agreements entered into by Oritanis executives on
the date hereof and identified on the _Oritani Disclosure Schedule_ and each
of the Oritani Pension Plans, Oritani Welfare Plans and Oritani Benefit Plans
as in effect as of the Effective Time, each in accordance with their
respective terms.

 

(b) Subject to the foregoing, as soon as possible following consummation of
the Merger, Valley will decide whether to continue each of the Oritani
Pension Plans and/or the Oritani Welfare Plans for the benefit of employees of
the Bank and Oritani, or to have such employees become covered under a Valley
welfare plan in accordance with the terms of the relevant Valley pension
and/or welfare plans provided there is no gap in time in health coverage or
coverage under the Valley 401(k) plan for all employees and officers of
Oritani who become employed by VNB. Subject to the foregoing, within two (2)
years following consummation of the Merger, Valley shall make available to all
employees and officers of Oritani who become employed by VNB coverage under
the benefit plans generally available to VNBs employees and officers
(including pension and health and hospitalization) on the terms and
conditions available to VNBs employees and officers in Valley or VNB medical
and dental plans for Oritani employees and their dependents. No prior existing
condition limitation not currently imposed by Oritani or the Bank medical or
dental plans shall be imposed with respect to Valleys or VNBs medical and
dental plans on Oritani or Bank employees. Oritani and Bank employees shall
receive credit for any deductibles and co-payments paid under Oritanis and
the Banks existing medical and dental plans. Oritani employees will be given
credit for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for benefit accrual
purposes) under Valleys or VNBs medical, life, vacation, sick leave,
disability and other welfare plans for prior service with Oritani, and
Oritanis and the Banks employees will be granted credit for such
prior service with Oritani, solely for purposes of eligibility and vesting
under Valleys or VNBs 401(k) plan. No Oritani employee will be given credit
for prior service under Valleys or VNBs Pension Plan for any purpose.

 

(c) Valley and VNB will use reasonable efforts to retain Oritani and Bank
employees following the Effective Time. Valley and VNB will endeavor to offer
the Bank employees whose jobs are eliminated as a result of the Merger the
opportunity to apply for open positions within Valley or VNB. In the event
that Valley or VNB terminates or lays off a sufficient number of employees
following the Effective Date to trigger a notice requirement under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar applicable
Law (" _WARN Act_ ") with respect to (i) Oritani and Bank employees employed
during the 90-day period preceding the Effective Time, and (ii) Oritani and
Bank employees employed by Valley or VNB after the Effective Time, Valley
shall be solely responsible for compliance with, and any liabilities incurred
pursuant to, the WARN Act. Oritani and the Bank shall cooperate in providing
information reasonably requested by Valley that is necessary for Valley to
prepare and distribute notices that Valley may desire to provide prior to the
Effective Time under the WARN Act.

(d) Except for Oritani and Bank employees who have individual severance or
similar contractual agreement, following the consummation of the Merger and
for one year thereafter, VNB shall pay severance to Oritani and Bank employees
who are involuntarily terminated by Valley or VNB for reasons other than
cause in an amount equal to two weeks salary for each year of service with
Oritani and Bank, subject to a minimum of four weeks and a maximum of 26
weeks severance pay.

 



53

    

(e) Within two weeks of the date of this Agreement, Valley and VNB, with
the cooperation of Oritani and the Bank, will develop, and thereafter
implement and communicate to key employees of Oritani and the Bank identified
as such by VNB executives together with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of Oritani, a retention program, designed to retain the
services of such key employees through the Effective Time and thereafter until
one hundred and eighty (180) days following the Closing Date or such earlier
or later time as Valley and VNB may determine consistent with their
respective business needs.

(f) Within thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, Oritani and the
Bank shall terminate the plans and arrangements set forth on the _Oritani
Disclosure Schedule_ and the amounts set forth in such _Oritani Disclosure
Schedule_ shall be payable to the participants of such plans.

(g) The Oritani Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _ESOP_ ") and any
related agreement shall be terminated on the Closing Date (all shares held by
the ESOP shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration), subject to the preparation of a termination amendment setting
forth the terms of termination and allocation and distribution of the ESOP
assets. Any outstanding ESOP indebtedness shall be repaid from unallocated
Oritani Common Stock held in the ESOPs suspense account which shall be
converted into Valley Common Stock at the Exchange Ratio and repurchased by
Valley. The balance of the unallocated shares of Oritani Common Stock and any
other assets remaining unallocated shall be allocated to ESOP participants
(subject to the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS
as provided for below), as provided for in the ESOP (as amended for
termination or unless otherwise required by applicable law). Prior to the
Effective Time, Oritani, and following the Effective Time, Valley, shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable
determination letter (including, but not limited to, making such changes to
the ESOP and the proposed allocations as may be requested by the IRS as a
condition to its issuance of a favorable determination letter). Oritani, and
following the Effective Time, Valley, will adopt such amendments to the ESOP
as may be reasonably required by the IRS as a condition to granting such
favorable determination letter on termination. Neither Oritani nor, following
the Effective Time, Valley, shall make any distribution from the ESOP to any
Oritani Employees who continue employment with Valley, except as may be
required by applicable law or the terms of the ESOP, until receipt of such
favorable determination letter. In the case of a conflict between the terms
of this Section 5.13(g) and the terms of the ESOP, the terms of the ESOP shall
control; however, in the event of any such conflict, Oritani before the
Merger, and Valley after the Merger, shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the ESOP to be amended to conform to the requirements of this
Section 5.13(g).

 

5.14 Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment.

 

(a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement constitute
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the
income Tax regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after the date of
this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each of Oritani and Valley shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not
knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act
could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a

 



54

    

 reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following
the Effective Time, neither Valley nor any affiliate shall knowingly take any
action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action, or cause any
action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

 

(b) As of the date hereof, Oritani does not know of any reason why it would
not be able to deliver to counsel to Valley and counsel to Oritani
certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling
guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions and modifications thereto
(the " _IRS Guidelines_ "), to enable counsel to Valley and counsel to
Oritani to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Section 6.1(d), and
Oritani hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of
such opinions to counsel to Valley and counsel to Oritani.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, Valley does not know of any reason why it would
not be able to deliver to counsel to Valley and counsel to Oritani
certificates substantially in compliance with the IRS Guidelines, with
reasonable or customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable
counsel to Valley and counsel to Oritani to deliver the legal opinions
contemplated by Section 6.1(d), and Valley hereby agrees to deliver such
certificates effective as of the date of such opinions to counsel to Valley
and counsel to Oritani.

 

5.15 Bank Policies and Bank Mergers. Notwithstanding that Oritani believes
that it has established all reserves and taken all provisions for possible
loan losses required by GAAP and applicable laws, rules and regulations,
Oritani recognizes that Valley may have adopted different loan, accrual and
reserve policies (including loan classifications and levels of reserves for
possible loan losses). From and after the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time and in order to formulate the plan of integration for the Bank
Merger, Oritani and Valley shall consult and cooperate with each other with
respect to (i) conforming to the extent appropriate, based upon such
consultation, Oritanis loan, accrual and reserve policies and Oritanis other
policies and procedures regarding applicable regulatory matters,
including without limitation FRB, Bank Secrecy Act and FDIC matters, to those
policies of Valley as Valley may reasonably identify to Oritani from time to
time, (ii) conforming, based upon such consultation, the composition of the
investment portfolio and overall asset/liability management position of
Oritani and the Bank to the extent appropriate, and (iii) developing a plan
for the conversion of Oritanis systems and processes to those of Valleys so
that such conversion can be implemented as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time; _provided_ that any required change in Oritanis practices in
connection with the matters described above need not be effected (A) more than
five days prior to the Effective Time and (B) unless and until all necessary
regulatory, governmental and shareholder approvals and consents have been
received, all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof have expired and
Valley agrees in writing that all conditions precedent to the Closing have
occurred (other than the delivery of certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents to be delivered at the Closing). No accrual or
reserve made by Oritani or any Oritani Subsidiary pursuant to this
subsection, or any litigation or regulatory proceeding arising out of any such
accrual or reserve, shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach or violation
of any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or to constitute a termination event within the meaning of
Section 7.1(e) or Section 7.1(f) hereof.

 



55

    

5.16 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties will
each take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause
any disposition of shares of Oritani Common Stock or conversion of any
derivative securities in respect of shares of Oritani Common Stock in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be exempt under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

 

5.17 Shareholder Litigation. Oritani shall give Valley the opportunity to
participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against Oritani and/or its directors or other
affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Valleys prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

5.18 Transaction Expenses of Oritani.

(a) For planning purposes, Oritani shall, within 30 days from the date
hereof, provide Valley with its estimated budget of transaction-related
expenses reasonably anticipated to be payable by Oritani in connection with
this transaction based on facts and circumstances currently known, including
the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other
professionals. Oritani shall promptly notify Valley if or when it determines
that it will expect to exceed its budget. Prior to signing this Agreement,
Oritani has disclosed to Valley the method by which the fees of its
investment bankers, accountants and counsel in connection with this
transaction are to be determined, and has disclosed to Valley the expected
fees of KBW and Oritanis accountants and counsel in connection with this
transaction. 

(b) Promptly, but in any event within 30 days after the execution of this
Agreement, Oritani shall ask all of its attorneys and other professionals to
render current and correct invoices for all unbilled time and disbursements.
Oritani shall accrue and/or pay all of such amounts as soon as possible.

 

(c) Oritani shall cause its professionals to render monthly invoices within
30 days after the end of each month. Oritani shall notify Valley monthly of
all out-of-pocket expenses which Oritani has incurred in connection with this
transaction.

 

(d) Valley, in reasonable consultation with Oritani, shall make all
arrangements with respect to the printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus.

5.19 Representation on Valley Board and VNB Board. Prior to the Closing,
the Board of Directors of Valley and the Board of Directors of VNB each shall
increase by one (1) the number of directors constituting the entire Boards of
Directors of Valley and VNB, respectively, effective as of and contingent
upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and shall duly appoint Kevin J.
Lynch, or, if Kevin J. Lynch is unwilling or unable to serve, another designee
to be selected by the Board of Directors of Valley from the current Oritani
Board of Directors (the " _Director Designee_ "), to become a director of
Valley and VNB, effective as of and contingent upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time. At a minimum, Valley shall nominate and recommend Kevin J.
Lynch or the Director Designee for election by Valley shareholders at
Valleys 2020 annual shareholder meeting and Valley, as sole shareholder of
VNB, shall appoint or elect Kevin J. Lynch, or the Director Designee, to the
board of directors of VNB for the year ended December 31, 2020. Kevin J.
Lynch or the Director Designee shall be subject to Valleys customary

 



56

    

 background screening and evaluation procedures for potential directors and
must meet all criteria set forth in Valleys governance principles with
respect to qualifications for directors and shall qualify as an independent
director under NASDAQ rules.

ARTICLE VII. - TERMINATION

 

7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Oritani:

(a) by mutual consent of Oritani and Valley;

(b) by either Valley or Oritani upon written notice to the other party
if the approval of any Governmental Entity required for consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is denied by
final, non-appealable action of such Governmental Entity; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision
of this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed to, such
action;

(c) by either Valley or Oritani, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the Cutoff Date (or such later date as shall have
been agreed to in writing by Valley and Oritani), provided, however, that no
party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if the
failure of the Closing to have occurred on or before the Cutoff Date was due
to such partys material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein;

 

(d) by either Valley or Oritani if (i) the approval of the shareholders of
Oritani required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held
meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, or
(ii) the approval of the shareholders of Valley required for the consummation
of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain
the required vote at a duly held meeting of such shareholders or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof;

 

(e) by either Valley or Oritani (provided that the terminating party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following
written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the Cutoff Date, and which breach of a
representation or warranty, would, individually or in the aggregate with
other breaches, (i) result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
party committing such breach, or (ii) result in one or more of the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 (in case of a termination by Valley) or 6.3
(in case of termination by Oritani) not to be satisfied or not capable of
being satisfied by the Cutoff Date;

(f) by either Valley or Oritani (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other
party, which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days following written
notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature,
cannot be cured prior to the Cutoff Date, and which breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant, would, individually

 



59

    

 or in the aggregate with other breaches, (i) result in a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to the party committing such breach, or (ii) result in one
or more of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 (in case of a
termination by Valley) or 6.3 (in case of termination by Oritani) not to be
satisfied or not capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff Date;

 

(g) by the Board of Directors of Valley if, (I) prior to receipt of the
Oritani Shareholder Approval, Oritani or the Oritani Board of Directors (or
any committee thereof) has (A) effected a Oritani Subsequent Determination or
approved, adopted, endorsed or recommended any Acquisition Proposal, (B)
failed to recommend the Merger and the approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of Oritani or failed to publicly re-affirm its recommendation of
the Merger within five days after receipt from Valley of a written request to
do so, (C) breached the terms of Section 5.3 in any material respect adverse
to Valley, or (D) in response to the commencement (other than by Valley or a
Subsidiary thereof) of a tender offer or exchange offer for 10% or more of the
outstanding shares of Oritani Common Stock, recommended that the shareholders
of Oritani tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise
failed to recommend that such shareholders reject such tender offer or
exchange offer promptly upon written request of Valley, or (II) any other
event occurs that gives rise to the payment of a Termination Fee (as hereafter
defined) and Termination Expenses (as hereafter defined) pursuant to Section
7.3 of this Agreement;

 

(h) by Oritani if, prior to receiving Oritani Shareholder Approval, (i)
Oritani has received a Superior Proposal, and in accordance with Section 5.3
of this Agreement, has entered into an acquisition agreement with respect to
the Superior Proposal, or (ii) if Oritanis Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with Oritanis outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the failure of Oritanis Board of Directors to
effect a Oritani Subsequent Determination would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, but only if prior to terminating this
Agreement, Oritani (A) pays to Valley the Termination Fee and Termination
Expenses and (B) delivers to Valley a release signed by the parties to such
acquisition agreement and any entity that controls such parties, which
release shall irrevocably waive any right the releasing parties may have to
challenge the payment to Valley of the Termination Fee and the payment to
Valley of the Termination Expenses;

 

(i) by Valley if one or more of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1
and 6.2 are not satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the
Cutoff Date;

(j) by Oritani if one or more of the conditions set forth in Sections
6.1 and 6.3 are not satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the
Cutoff Date; or

(k) by Oritani, if the board of directors of Oritani so determines by a
majority vote of its members, in the event that, as of the Determination Date,
both of the following conditions are satisfied:

 

(i) the Average Determination Price shall be less than 80% of the Valley
Starting Price; and

 

(ii) (A) the number obtained by dividing the Average Determination Price by
the Valley Starting Price (such number, the " _Valley Ratio_ ") is less than
(B) the number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index
Price and subtracting 0.20 from such quotient (such number, the "
_Index Ratio_ ").

 



60

    

If Oritani elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section
7.1(k), it shall give written notice to Valley not later than the end of the
third business day next following the Determination Date. During the five
business day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Valley may, at
its option, increase the Exchange Ratio to a number equal to the lesser of
(x) a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-ten-thousandth), the numerator of
which is equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and

(y) a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-ten-thousandth), the numerator of
which is the product of the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), the Valley
Starting Price and 0.80, and the denominator of which is the Average
Determination Price. If Valley makes an election contemplated by the preceding
sentence within such five (5) business day period, it shall give prompt
written notice to Oritani of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio and
no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 7.1(k) and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except that the
Exchange Ratio shall be modified), and any references in this Agreement to "
_Exchange Ratio_ " shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio
as adjusted pursuant to this Section 7.1(k).

 

If the outstanding shares of Valley Common Stock or any company belonging to
the Index shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares, or similar transaction between the date of the Agreement
and the Determination Date, the prices for the common stock of such company
will be appropriately adjusted.

For purposes of this Section 7.1(k), the following terms shall have the
meanings set forth below:

" _Average Determination Price_ " of the Valley Common Stock shall mean the
VWAP of the Valley Common Stock for the ten (10) trading day period ending on
the trading date immediately preceding the Determination Date, rounded to the
nearest one-tenth of a cent.

 

" _Determination Date_ " means the date on which the last required approval of
a Governmental Entity is obtained with respect to the Merger, without regard
to any requisite waiting period.

" _Final Index Price_ " means the average, rounded to the nearest one-tenth
of a cent, of the closing prices of the Index for the same trading days used
in calculating the Average Determination Price.

 

" _Index_ " means the KBW NASDAQ Regional Banking Index (the " _KRX_ ") or, if
such Index is not available, such substitute or similar index as
substantially replicates the KRX.

" _Initial Index Price_ " means the average, rounded to the nearest one-tenth
of a cent, of the closing prices of the Index for the same trading days used
in calculating the Valley Starting Price.

" _Valley Starting Price_ " shall mean the VWAP of the Valley Common Stock
for the ten trading day period ending on the day immediately preceding the
date of this Agreement, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent.

either Valley or Oritani as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except that (i) Sections 5.5(b), 5.9,
Articles VII and VIII and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that either of the parties
shall willfully default in its obligations hereunder, the non-defaulting party
may pursue any remedy available at law or in equity to enforce its rights and
shall be paid by the willfully defaulting party for all damages, costs and
expenses, including without limitation legal, accounting, investment banking
and printing expenses, incurred or suffered by the non-defaulting party in
connection herewith or in the enforcement of its rights hereunder.

 

7.3 Termination Fee; Expenses.

 

(a) In the event that at any time after the date of this Agreement Valley
or Oritani shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or
7.1(f), then the breaching party shall pay to the non-breaching party on the
date of such termination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount equal to the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Valley in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as itemized by the non-
breaching party), up to $1.8 million (the " _Termination Expenses_ ").

 

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) or intention
to make an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) shall have been
made directly to Oritanis shareholders or otherwise publicly disclosed or
otherwise communicated or made known to senior management of Oritani or
Oritani Board of Directors and (B) this Agreement is thereafter terminated
(x) by Oritani or Valley pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(d)(i) (but
only if, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i), the
Registration Statement shall have been declared effective no later than sixty
(60) days prior to the Cutoff Date), or (y) by Valley pursuant to Section
7.1(e) or Section 7.1(f), then, (I) Oritani shall pay to Valley, immediately
upon such termination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Termination Expenses, and, (II) if within 12 months after such termination,
Oritani or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or consummates a transaction contemplated by, any Acquisition
Proposal (which, in each case, need not be the same Acquisition Proposal that
shall have been made, publicly disclosed or communicated prior to termination
hereof), then Oritani shall pay Valley, on the earlier of the date of such
execution or consummation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a
fee of $28 million (the " _Termination Fee_ "); or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Valley pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or
by Oritani pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then Oritani shall pay Valley,
immediately upon such termination, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the Termination Fee and Termination Expenses.

 



62

    

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, if Oritani pays or causes to be paid to Valley the Termination Fee,
neither Oritani nor the Bank (or any successor in interest of Oritani or the
Bank) nor any of their officers, directors or affiliates will have any
further obligations or liabilities to Valley or VNB with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except in
the case of fraud or willful misconduct, payment of the Termination Fee shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of Valley in the event of termination of
this Agreement on the bases specified in Sections 7.3(b)(i) and 7.3(b)(ii)
above.

For purposes of Section 7.3(b)(i), the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall
have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 5.3(d)(i) except that references
in Section 5.3(d)(i) to "25%" shall be replaced by "50%".

the Valley Disclosure Schedule and the other documents, agreements and
instruments executed and delivered pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement, contain the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect

(a) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall

right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this Agreement.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely
upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations
of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



64

    

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing clause, following the Effective Time
(but not unless and until the Effective Time occurs), the provisions of
Section 5.12 shall be enforceable by each Oritani Indemnitee described
therein.

 

8.6 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof to any person (including the officers and directors of Oritani or
Valley) or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions, or the
application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as
to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force
and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such determination, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith in an
effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect
the original intent of the parties hereto.

8.7 Counterparts; PDF Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement

and accepted by portable data file (pdf) signature and any such signature
shall be of the same force and effect as an original signature.

any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey or any New Jersey state court sitting in Passaic County, and each
of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocable waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 8.8
shall not constitute a general consent to service of process in the State of
New Jersey and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this
Section 8.8. The parties hereto agree that final judgment in any suit, action
or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

 

8.9 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of this Agreement are

shall terminate as of the Effective Time except for those covenants and
agreements included herein which by their terms apply in whole or in part
after the Effective Time. The provisions of Section 5.5(b), Articles VII and
