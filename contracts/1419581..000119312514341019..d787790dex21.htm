---|---|--- 

4\. Business Employees



   4.1 | Employees to be transferred 
---|--- 

Seller has provided in section 16.2.7 of the VDR a list of Business Employees
as of the Signing Date. The Parties agree and acknowledge that, in the
ordinary course of business, due to, inter alia, terminations and
replacements, the list of Business Employees will undergo certain changes
during the period between the Signing Date and the Closing Date and such list
will be updated as of the Closing Date to reflect the same. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, from the Signing Date until the Closing Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
services of the Business Employees.



   4.2 | General Principles 
---|--- 

Seller is a value-driven company. Its core values include, inter
alia, compliance with all legal requirements, social responsibility and a
trustful cooperation with its employees and their representatives. These
values reflect the manner in which Seller runs its business and all its
business transactions. Against this background, the Parties agree that the
following general principles shall be applied with regard to the envisaged
transfer of the Business Employees:

 



37/114 relationships of the Business Employees are governed by the Laws of various
jurisdictions and that the transfer of the Business Employees to Purchaser or
a Purchaser Designee as contemplated by this Section 4 is subject to
different legal requirements depending on the jurisdiction by which the
employment relationship of the respective Business Employee is governed. In
connection with the transfer of the Business Employees to Purchaser or a
Purchaser Designee, each Party shall comply, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to comply, with all applicable Laws and any agreement with any
relevant trade union, works council, other employee representative body, or
with any individual Business Employee. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | Each Party agrees to provide the respective other Party with
information reasonably required by the other Party and to cooperate and take
all reasonably necessary actions, and to cause their respective Affiliates
to cooperate and take all reasonably necessary actions, to (i) comply with
any legal requirement (whether statutory or pursuant to any agreement with any
relevant trade union, works council or other employee representative body, or
with any individual Business Employee) in respect of the contemplated
transfer of the Business Employees to Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee, and
(ii) inform, consult or negotiate with or seek consent from the relevant
employees, trade unions, works councils or any other employee representative
body in relation to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | The Parties agree and acknowledge that the intended transfer
of all Business Employees will require both Parties as well as their
respective Affiliates to actively encourage Business Employees not to object
to a transfer of their employment relationships to Purchaser or a Purchaser
Designee or to reject Purchasers or Purchaser Designees Employment Offer, as
the case may be. This shall include making Business Employees aware of the
possibility that Seller might not be in a position to continue to employ the
Business Employees in such cases. Seller will, depending on the respectively
applicable legal background, consider redundancies as an option, without a
commitment to redundancies of Seller towards Purchaser or any Third Party,
and will inform the Business Employees at the outset that there is no
guarantee of continuous employment in the same role or location within the
Sellers Group. The Parties shall use all reasonable efforts, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to use all reasonable efforts, to advertise for a
transfer and to support each others efforts to facilitate the transfer of
Business Employees. Purchaser is prepared, in particular but not limited to,
to give presentations before Business Employees on its business operation and
its plans for the Business and to answer individual Business Employees
questions on the perspectives for their employment relationship after
the transfer. Unless approved by the respective other Party in writing, both
Parties shall at any time between the Signing Date and the Closing Date
refrain from any communication or other actions which are intended to cause,
provoke or encourage a Business Employee to object to the transfer of his or
her employment relationship to Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee or to reject
Purchasers or Purchaser Designees Employment Offer, as the case may be. 
---|---|--- 
 



38/114 costs (including retention payments or pension obligations) related to any
Objecting Employee, except to the extent expressly provided in Section
3.3(a)(gg) with respect to the German ATZ Liability. If, despite the
intention of the Parties, any individual (other than the Business Employees)
currently being employed by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller will claim after
Closing his or her employment with Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee, a Sold
Entity or a Sold JV Entity, Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and hold
Purchaser harmless against any and all claims which Purchaser or the relevant
Purchaser Designee, a Sold Entity or a JV Majority Participation, may be
subject to in that respect and against any and all costs Purchaser or a
Purchaser Designee, a Sold Entity or a JV Majority Participation may suffer as
a result thereof. Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser Designee undertakes
to issue a notice of termination ( _K undigungserklarung_) to the relevant
individuals as soon as possible after becoming aware of the claim for
employment, if legally permissible under the relevant applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



   4.3 | Methods for Transfer 
---|--- 

The Parties agree and acknowledge that, depending on the structure of
the contemplated transaction and the applicable legal requirements in the
respective jurisdiction, the Business Employees shall be transferred to
Purchaser or a Purchasers Designee by any of the following methods:

 



     | a. | Change of Ownership 
---|---|--- 

Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee acquires the shares in a Sold Entity or a
JV Majority Participation which employs any of the Business Employees; such
legal entity being an existing Affiliate of Seller as of the Signing Date.



     | b. | By Virtue of Law 
---|---|--- 

Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee acquires assets pertaining to the
Business and, subject to the legal requirements in the respective
jurisdiction, such acquisition constitutes a transfer of undertaking (
_Betriebs ubergang_) pursuant to Section 613a German Civil Code ( _B
urgerliches Gesetzbuch_) or similar or comparable Laws in other
jurisdictions, including but not limited to any legislation implementing the
European Acquired Rights Directive. The Parties agree and acknowledge that, in
this event, the employment relationships of the respective Business Employees
will, subject to the non-objection by the individual Business Employee, to the
extent such objection is permitted by the legal requirements of the respective
jurisdiction, transfer to Purchaser or the Purchaser Designee automatically.
Insofar as required by the legal requirements of the respective jurisdiction,
Seller or the respective Selling Affiliate shall notify the respective
Business Employees in accordance with the applicable legal requirements. This
shall include making Business Employees

 



39/114  aware of the possibility that in the case of objections to the transfer of
employment relationships Seller might not be in a position to continue to
employ the Business Employees. Seller shall consult with Purchaser about the
wording of the information. The Parties undertake to disclose the information
necessary for such notification and make it accessible to one another.
Purchaser shall furnish Seller and the respective Asset Selling Affiliate
with sufficient and correct information within its sphere which is required by
Seller or the respective Asset Selling Affiliate to fulfil all information
obligations towards the respective Business Employees pursuant to the
applicable legal requirements. Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and the
respective Asset Selling Affiliate from any and all losses incurred or
suffered by Seller and the respective Asset Selling Affiliate as a result of
any failure by Purchaser to provide sufficient and correct information.
Seller shall indemnify Purchaser from any and all losses incurred or suffered
by it as a result of any failure by Seller or the respective Asset Selling
Affiliate to provide sufficient and correct information. The Parties shall
comprehensively inform one another without undue delay about objections of
Business Employees to the transfer of their employment relationship and shall,
without undue delay, make any correspondence in this context available to
the other Party.



     | c. | Offer of Employment 
---|---|--- 

In the event, that the employment relationship of any of the
Business Employees does not transfer to Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee by
way of change of ownership pursuant to Section 4.3(a) or by virtue of Law
pursuant to Section 4.3(b) for reasons other than an objection of the
respective employee, the following shall apply: Subject to Sellers right to
review any offer of employment before it is presented to any Business
Employee, Purchaser shall extend, or shall ensure that a Purchaser Designee in
the respective jurisdiction extends, the Employment Offer to all Business
Employees. Purchaser or the Purchaser Designee shall not amend such terms and
conditions to the detriment of Business Employees for at least twenty-four
(24) months after the Closing Date. Seller will use reasonable efforts to
procure the Business Employees agreement to the Employment Offer from
Purchaser or the Purchaser Designee, as the case may be, and Seller or the
respective Asset Selling Affiliate shall release from employment the Business
Employees who have accepted the Employment Offer with effect from the Closing
Date. For purposes of the definition of Employment Offers, "substantially
similar terms and conditions" shall mean not significantly less
favorable terms and conditions of employment in the aggregate (including
status, position, responsibility and period of employment) and an equal or
more favorable monetary value of the total gross individual remuneration and
benefits package as well as same or higher base pay and same or higher total
cash (base pay and bonus, if any) for a Business Employee at the Closing Date,
but excluding participation in any equity incentive plans (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not excluding Purchasers reasonable estimate of the
value thereof). Insofar as permitted and enforceable and if requested by
Purchaser, the workload to be done by those Business Employees, who have not
accepted the Employment Offers, will be continued on the basis
of transitional service agreements (against reimbursement of costs) in order
to ensure a continuous operation of the business.

 



40/114 ---|--- 



     | a. | Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Section 4
and in Section 3.3(a)(ii), with effect as of the Closing Date, the Seller and
its Affiliates, as the case may be, shall retain all obligations
and liabilities arising out of the conduct of the Business prior to Closing
Date vis-a-vis any of the Business Employees. Purchaser shall assume all
pension liabilities with respect to the Business Employees, other than the
Objecting Employees, in Mexico, France and Germany, and except as provided in
Section 4.2(d). 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | Purchaser or Purchaser Designee shall, for the minimum period
of twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date, provide benefits under
benefit plans for the Business Employees with benefits not less favorable
in the aggregate than those benefits the Business Employees were granted
under the benefit plans of Seller or the applicable Selling Affiliate existing
as of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall ensure that the Business Employees do
not suffer any gap in their benefits due to the transfer (for example 
exclusion of pre-existing medical conditions, medical underwriting of
benefits, etc.). Any out-of-pocket expense payments made by a Business
Employee to a health insurance plan by Seller or any of the Selling
Affiliates during the plan year shall count towards any out-of-pocket limits
in health plans of Purchaser or Purchaser Designee. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in
this Agreement shall restrict Purchaser or any Purchaser Designee from
amending the terms or conditions of employment or adjusting benefits of the
Business Employees to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with
restructuring plans, changing economic conditions, or employee performance
issues. 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | Seller shall retain and be responsible for all liability in
respect of, and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser Indemnified Parties
harmless from, any and all liability or other obligations with respect to (i)
former employees, and (ii) Business Employees for liability relating to pre-
Closing periods except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in this
Section 4 (including, without limitation, claims, actions, suits
or proceedings). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall be
responsible to the extent any such liabilities are reflected in the Net
Working Capital. 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to Business
Employees of the Asset Selling Affiliate in China, any and all obligations and
liabilities of the employer as required by the applicable Laws in relation to
such Business Employees arising on and after the date of transfer or re-
employment as set out in the Local Asset Sale and Transfer Agreement shall be
assumed by the relevant Purchaser Designees, and in the event Seller or such
Asset Selling Affiliate becomes liable under applicable Laws to compensate
any Business Employees agreeing to transfer their employment to or be re-
employed by the relevant Purchaser Designees, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller
or the relevant Asset Selling Affiliate in respect of any such compensation
paid by Seller or such Asset Selling Affiliate. 
---|---|--- 
 



41/114 any severance benefits or payments for individuals who refuse to transfer to
Purchaser upon Close. 
---|---|--- 
 



   4.5 | Retention Agreements 
---|--- 

The Seller or any of the Selling Affiliates shall be solely liable for any
payments, including but not limited to any retention bonuses and other bonus
payments, which become due prior to or after the Closing Date under retention
agreements between the Seller or any Selling Affiliates and the Business
Employee identified on Schedule 4.5. Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and
hold Purchaser harmless against any and all claims which Purchaser or the
relevant Purchaser Designee, a Sold Entity or a JV Majority Participation may
be subject to in that respect and against any and all costs Purchaser or a
Purchaser Designee may suffer as a result thereof. None of Seller or any
Selling Affiliate shall issue a competing offer of employment as contemplated
by such Retention Agreements.

 



   5. | Purchaser Designee 
---|--- 



   5.1 | The Parties agree that Purchaser may assign the right to acquire
certain of the Sold Entities, the Sold JV Shares, the Sold Assets or the
Assumed Contracts or to assume certain of the Assumed Liabilities
or employment relationships with Business Employees to one or more Purchaser
Designees. Notwithstanding any such assignment or assumption by a Purchaser
Designee, Purchaser shall remain jointly and severally liable in addition to
such Purchaser Designee for, and any such assignment, assumption or execution
shall not relieve Purchaser of, any liabilities and obligations of Purchaser
and the Purchaser Designees under or in connection with this Agreement. Any
reference to Purchaser in this Agreement shall, to the extent applicable,
also be deemed a reference to the applicable Purchaser Designee, except where
in the context of this Agreement such use would not be appropriate. The fact
that Purchaser Designees are expressly referenced or not referenced in
certain provisions of the Agreement shall not limit the generality of the
immediately preceding sentence with respect to other provisions of this
Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   5.2 | No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, Purchaser
shall definitely confirm the identity of each Purchaser Designee to Seller in
writing.

     | c. | plus an amount equal to the Cash as of the Measurement Time;
and 
---|---|---

for a final allocation of the Purchase Price which shall become final and
binding on the Parties, if Purchaser does not object within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the proposal by Purchaser in a form as set forth accordingly
in Sections 8.6 and 8.7; _provided_ , _however_ that if any adjustment to the

after receipt of such draft Form 8594, Purchaser will notify Seller whether it
has any proposed revisions to such Form and, in the event of such
disagreement, the Parties will make a good faith attempt to resolve such
dispute.

period during all or a portion of which the Sold Entity is a member of a
consolidated, combined, unitary or affiliated group or a fiscal unity with
Seller its Affiliates (other than the Sold Entities). Each such Tax Return
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with historical practice, except to
the extent otherwise required by Law. Seller shall submit each such Tax Return
(and any additional information regarding such Tax Return requested by
Purchaser) to Purchaser for filing at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Return to allow Purchaser to review, comment,
and object to the Tax Return based on Purchasers review. If Purchaser
objects to such Tax Return, Purchaser shall notify Seller of its objection in
writing within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such Tax Return. Purchaser
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt to resolve
the objection to the reasonable satisfaction of both parties and, if they are
unable to resolve the dispute within five (5) days of Sellers receipt of
Purchasers written notification, the parties shall refer the disputed Tax
Return to the Accounting Firm for final determination. The Accounting Firm
shall make a final determination, which will be binding on both parties, at
least five (5) days prior to due date for filing such Tax Return. Purchaser

Tax Return, provided that Seller shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify
Purchaser no later than the due date of such Tax Return for, Indemnifiable

Straddle Period Tax Return as may reasonably be requested by Seller) for
review and comment at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date
for filing to allow Seller to review, comment, and object to the Straddle
Period Tax Return based on Sellers reasonable review. If Seller objects
to such Straddle Period Tax Return, Seller shall notify Purchaser of its
objection in writing within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such Straddle
Period Tax Return. Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith in an
attempt to resolve the objection to the reasonable satisfaction of both
parties and, if they are unable to resolve the dispute within five (5) days of
Purchasers receipt of Sellers written notification, the parties shall refer
the disputed Straddle Period Tax Return to the Accounting Firm for final
determination. The Accounting Firm shall make a final determination, which
will be binding on both parties, at least five (5) days prior to the due date
for filing such Straddle Period Tax Return. Purchaser shall pay, or cause to
be paid, all Taxes shown as due on each such Tax Returns, provided, however,
that in the case of a Straddle Period Tax Return, Seller shall be responsible
for, and Seller shall indemnify Purchaser no later than the due date of such
Straddle Period Tax Return for, Indemnifiable Taxes shown as due on such
Straddle Period Tax Return, except to the extent as provided in Section
12.2(a)(aa). 
---|--- 
 



     | dd. | Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes. For purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the
portion of such Straddle Period ending prior to the Closing Date shall (i) in
the case of any real and personal property Taxes, be deemed to be the amount
of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period up to but not
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Straddle
Period ended on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date. Any prepayments
and deposits of Taxes (or credits for Taxes paid with respect to a prior
taxable period) by Seller, a Sold Entity or a JV Majority Participation
relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the
relevant Straddle Period ended prior to the Closing Date, and any other Tax
credits for a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the pre-Closing
and post-Closing portions of the Straddle Period in the same manner as the
Tax to which they relate would be allocated. All determinations necessary to
give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent
with prior practice of the Sold Entities, JV Majority Participations, and the
Seller. 
---|---|--- 
 



80/114 consolidated, combined, unitary or affiliated group or in a fiscal unity with
Seller or their Affiliates (other than the Sold Entities) for any taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending before the Closing Date, Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Sold Entities) (i) shall, if required or permitted
by applicable Law, use any of their losses, credits or other tax attributes to
reduce the Tax liability of the Sold Entity for taxable periods (or portions
thereof) ending before the Closing Date and (ii) may, if required or permitted
by applicable Law, use any losses, credits or other tax attributes of the Sold
Entity arising in a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending before the
Closing Date to reduce their own Tax liability and shall not be required to
compensate the Sold Entity or Purchaser for any such losses, credits or other
tax attributes. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | e. | Cooperation on Tax Matters 
---|---|--- 



     | aa. | Settlement of Deficiencies and Adjustments. If any Taxing
Authority issues to any Purchaser, Sold Entity or a JV Majority Participation,
a notice of deficiency or any other type of proposed adjustment of Taxes of
the Sold Entity or JV Majority Participation that could give rise solely to
Indemnifiable Taxes, Purchaser must notify Seller within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt of the notice of deficiency or other proposed adjustment.
Seller and the applicable Seller Entity, at their own expense, have the sole
and exclusive right to contest any assessment or other proposed adjustment of
Taxes of the Sold Entity or JV Majority Participation, as applicable, that
could give rise solely to Indemnifiable Taxes. Seller has full right to
control the conduct of any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a
"Tax Proceeding") that could give rise solely to Indemnifiable Taxes;
provided, however, that Purchaser and its representatives shall have the
right, at Purchasers expense, to participate in any such Tax Proceeding;
provided, further, that settlement or other resolution of such Tax Proceeding
shall be subject to the consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Seller shall keep Purchaser fully and
timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any Tax
Proceeding controlled by it and Seller shall in good faith allow Purchaser to
make comments to Seller regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any
such Tax Proceeding. Purchaser, at its own expense, has the sole and exclusive
right to contest any assessment or other proposed adjustment of Taxes of a
Sold Entity or Sold JV Entity that could give rise to non-Indemnifiable
Taxes, and shall control the conduct of any Tax Proceeding that could give
rise to non-Indemnifiable Taxes; provided, however that, if any such Tax
Proceeding could give rise to Indemnifiable Taxes as well as non-
Indemnifiable Taxes, then (i) Seller and its representatives shall have the
right, at Sellers expense, to participate in any such Tax Proceeding, (ii)
settlement or other resolution of any such Tax Proceeding shall be subject to
the consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and (iii) Purchaser shall keep Seller fully and timely informed with
respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Proceeding and
Purchaser shall in good faith allow Seller to make comments to Purchaser
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such Tax Proceeding. 
---|---|--- 
 



81/114 and JV Majority Participations, their Affiliates and their respective
employees and advisors fully cooperate with Seller and its advisors in
connection with the filing of any Tax Return or the conduct of any Tax
Proceeding, including but not limited to the filing of any Tax Return in
accordance with Section 12.2(d) and the conduct of any inquiry, examination,
audit, investigation, negotiation, dispute, appeal or litigation. For the
avoidance of doubt, such cooperation shall include: 
---|---|--- 



     | (1) | Keeping and making available to Seller, and instructing that
the Sold Entities and JV Majority Participations keep and make available to
Seller, all books, records, and information relating (wholly or partly) to any
Tax Return or Tax Proceeding in accordance with, and during the periods
required under, statutory Law (and, to the extent such books, records, and
information might be of relevance for such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding, until
the relevant Tax has become final and binding and any related Tax Return can
no longer be amended) and, following such periods, giving Seller reasonable
notice prior to transferring, discarding or destroying any such books,
records, and information, and allowing Seller to take possession of any such
books, records, and information: and 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | Providing, or instructing the Sold Entities and JV Majority
Participations to provide, to Seller and its advisors, upon Sellers
reasonable written request, all relevant documents or other information to
such Tax Returns or Tax Proceedings and permitting, or instructing the Sold
Entities to permit, Seller and its representatives to have reasonable access,
during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the
premises, employees, books, and records of the Sold Entities. 
---|---|--- 



     | cc. | If and to the extent a claim under this Section 12.2 relates
to a JV Majority Participation, the amount to be paid by the Seller, the
Relevant JV Share Seller or the Purchaser hereunder shall be the relevant
amount multiplied by the Relevant JV Share Sellers current shareholding
percentage in such JV Majority Participation. 
---|---|--- 



     | dd. | As far as consistent with applicable Laws and accounting
standards, all determinations necessary to give effect to the allocations
under this Section 12.2 shall be made in a manner consistent with past
practice of the Sold Entities. 
---|---|--- 
 



82/114 ---|--- 



     | a. | The Purchase Price is meant to be a net amount that does not
include any VAT. To the extent that the execution of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is subject to VAT, such VAT shall be paid by
Purchaser at Closing in addition to the Purchase Price if and to the extent
such VAT is owed by Seller and/or a Selling Affiliate to the relevant Taxing
Authority. Provided however, that if such VAT is an Unrecoverable VAT, the
amount paid by purchaser at Closing Shall be the amount specified in Section
24.1 hereof. If and to the extent VAT is owed by Purchaser pursuant to reverse
charge mechanism or any similar provision under the VAT Laws of a relevant
jurisdiction, Purchaser shall remit it to the competent Taxing Authority (by
way of cash payment or other applicable settlement method). Seller and/or the
relevant Selling Affiliate shall issue on the Closing Date any required
invoices and required supporting documentation in line with applicable VAT
Laws. The determination (i) to what extent the transaction contemplated by the
execution of this Agreement is subject to VAT, and (ii) to what extent such
VAT is owed by Seller, a Selling Affiliate or by Purchaser shall be made by
the Parties prior to Closing; if the Parties fail to reach such an agreement
the reasonable opinion of Seller on such treatment shall be applied at Closing
reflected in any invoices to be issued on the Closing Date and VAT returns to
be filed by the Parties with respect the sale and transfer of the Business. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | To the extent applicable and legally possible the Parties
shall seek and cooperate to treat the sale and transfer of the Business in the
relevant jurisdiction as a non-VATable transfer of a going concern (i.e.,
business as a whole) and provide each other with all relevant information for
that purpose. Twenty (20) Business Days after Purchaser has identified all
Purchaser Designees according to Section 5.2, Seller shall indicate to
Purchaser which transactions, according to Sellers opinion, may trigger VAT.
In respect of the transactions that have been treated as a non-VATable
transfer of a going concern at Closing, Purchaser represents that it and each
Purchaser Designee (i) is an entrepreneur for VAT purposes, (ii) acquires the
Business for its business ( _f ur sein Unternehmen_) and (iii) will continue
to run the Business for a period of at least twenty four (24) months
essentially in a way as it was run immediately prior to the Closing Date (
_Unternehmensfortf uhrung_). For the avoidance of doubt, the last sentence of
Section 12.3(a) remains unaffected. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | c. | Seller and each relevant Selling Affiliate have the right to
opt for VAT on the Closing Date in respect of but not limited to the Sold
Assets to the extent the requirements under the relevant VAT Laws are
fulfilled. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 12.3(b) shall be unaffected. 
---|---|--- 



     | d. |

If a VAT amount actually payable as a consequence of the execution of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement turns out to be higher or
lower than the amount shown on the relevant invoice issued by Seller or a
Selling Affiliate (including if no VAT has been invoiced at all) due to (i)
the Final Purchase Price Allocation, (ii) an assessment after Closing of a
Taxing Authority in charge of Sellers or a Selling Affiliates VAT affairs,
or (iii) for any other reason identified by the Parties after Closing, the
Parties shall make appropriate declarations and filings with the relevant
Taxing Authorities,  

---|---|--- 
 



83/114 Laws), provide to the respective other Party any requested information and
copies of relevant documents and make any required payments to each other and
the Taxing Authorities, respectively, in each case without undue delay. In
particular, if according to a determination made by a Taxing Authority in
charge of Sellers or a Selling Affiliates VAT affairs the VAT payable by
Seller or a Selling Affiliate is higher than shown on the relevant invoice
(including if no VAT has been invoiced at all), Purchaser shall pay the
corresponding shortfall amount to Seller (taking into account whether or not
the VAT is an Unrecoverable VAT) (or the relevant Selling Affiliate as
directed by Seller) within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of
notification of the shortfall amount by Seller, but not earlier than five (5)
Business Days before the relevant VAT becomes due (taking into account any
extension of the due date granted by the Taxing Authority). Any interest
and/or penalty due to be paid to a Taxing Authority on the VAT due by the
execution of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
by Purchaser, provided however, that in the case of an Unrecoverable VAT, such
amount shall be borne by the Purchaser in accordance with Section 24.1 hereof
in respect of those transactions treated as a non-VAT able transfer of
a going concern; in all other cases any interest and/or penalty shall be
equally borne by the Parties unless and to the extent such interest and/or
penalty is triggered by a failure of one Party to timely pay the VAT in
accordance with the determination under Section 12.3(a) in which case such
Party shall bear the respective interest/penalty. 
---|--- 



   12.4 | Limitation Period 
---|--- 

Claims under this Section 12 or in respect of breaches of Section 10.20 shall
be time-barred upon the expiration of a period of six (6) months after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the
relevant Tax, provided, however, in each case that Sellers rights under this
Section 12 shall not be time-barred before the expiration of three (3) months
after Seller has been notified by Purchaser about the circumstance giving rise
to a Sellers claim.

 



   12.5 | Miscellaneous 
---|--- 



     | a. | Any payment under Section 12 shall be treated as an
adjustment of the Purchase Price, consistent with the provisions of Section
11.9 herein. Any Tax incident giving rise to claims under this Section
12 shall only be dealt with under this Section 12\. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | It is the common understanding of the Seller and Purchaser
that the Base Purchase Price has been allocated among the Sold Entities, the
Sold JV Entities, the Sold Assets and the Assumed Contracts on an
arms length basis for tax purposes as set forth in Section 7.2. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Tax Elections. Purchaser shall have the right, only after
obtaining written consent from Seller, to make an election under IRC Section
338(g). 
---|---|--- 
 



84/114 hereunder, including, without limitation, the payment of any Purchase Price
shall, except to the extent contemplated hereunder or as otherwise required by
Law be free and clear of withholding. In the event Purchaser determines that
any withholding of Tax pursuant to this provision is required, Purchaser
agrees to reasonably promptly notify Seller of the proposed amount of such
withholding and, at Sellers request, to disclose to Seller the basis for
such withholding and to consider any proposals by Seller that would reduce or
eliminate the amount of such withholding. Any amount withheld hereunder, or as
otherwise required by Law shall be treated as paid hereunder and received by
Seller or Seller Affiliate as applicable, for all purposes hereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | Mexican Tax Considerations. As of the Closing Date, the
parties hereby agree that TRW Odyssey Mexico LLC (the "Mexican Seller") shall
be a corporate tax resident of Mexico, as defined under the
relevant provisions of the Mexican Income Tax Law (" _Ley del Impuesto Sobre
la Renta_ " or "LISR"). As a consequence thereof, the parties agree that
Mexican Seller shall include the sales proceeds for the sale of the shares of
the Mexican Sold Entity within its taxable income and subject to Mexican
taxation in accordance with the relevant provisions of the LISR. For purposes
of the above, Seller has provided Purchaser with a copy of the certificate
confirming the registration of Mexican Seller with the Mexican Federal
Taxpayers Registry ("Registro Federal de Contribuyentes").

13. Environmental Indemnifications



   13.1 | Indemnification of Purchaser

Future Remediation Measures and Investigated Sites Remediation Measures
subject to the conditions under this Section 13; or (b) third-party claims

Section 15.2, except where (i) the Individual Incident occurs at a property
where Current Remediation Measures are being implemented, and (ii) the
Individual Incident is not an Existing Environmental Condition as identified
in Schedule 13.2(a), and (iii) the Individual Incident involves the same
Hazardous Substance being addressed by the Current Remediation Measures, in
which case the Liability Cap under Section 15.2 does not apply. By way of
example: (i) if an Environmental Loss related to an Individual Incident
amounts to USD 2,000,000.00, of which in the first place USD 500,000.00 have
been paid by the Purchaser and USD 1,500,000.00 by the Seller, under this

an Environmental Loss related to Individual Incident amounts to USD
7,000,000.00, of which in the first place USD 1,000,000.00 have been paid by

would receive reimbursement from the Purchaser in the amount of USD
500,000.00.

Cost Sharing Amount, the Parties agree to the following settlement system: In
case an Individual Incident occurs, the Beneficiary Party will notify and
provide evidence of its incurred Individual Incident Costs to the other Party
at the end of each calendar month. Provided that the Beneficiary Party has
submitted a proper invoice, the other Party shall promptly pay fifty (50)
percent of the Individual Incident Costs to the Beneficiary Party. The payment
shall be made in no case later than thirty (30) Business Days after the
Beneficiary Party has provided a proper invoice to the other Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | dd. | Except as otherwise provided in Section 13.2(b)(bb), any
liability of the Seller under or in connection with Future Remediation

     | bb. | With respect to any Investigated Sites Remediation Measures
at the Investigated Site in Blumberg (Germany), Seller and Purchaser shall
share Environmental Losses as set forth in Section 13.2(b)(bb) in its
entirety.  
---|---|--- 



     | cc. | Any liability of the Seller under or in connection with
Investigated Sites Remediation Measures shall count towards the Liability Cap
pursuant to Section 15.2. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | e. | Remediation Measures at JV Majority Participation Sites 
---|---|--- 

If and to the extent a claim under this Section 13 relates to a JV Majority
Participation the amount to be paid by the Seller shall be the relevant amount
of the Environmental Losses multiplied by the Relevant JV Share Sellers
shareholding percentage in such JV Majority Participation. For the avoidance
of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not limit any direct Environmental
Losses suffered by a Purchaser Indemnified Party other than a Sold JV Entity.
If and to the extent Seller or Purchaser has borne costs exceeding its share
of the Individual Incident Cost Sharing Amount, it shall be reimbursed the
exceeding amount by the counter-party. Those exceeding amounts shall be deemed
Individual Incident Costs.

 



   13.3 | Environmental Losses Notice 
---|--- 



     | a. | If a Purchaser Indemnified Party has an Environmental Losses
Indication, Purchaser shall give Seller Environmental Losses Notice within

the Closing Date, of willful or grossly negligent omission by Purchaser or any
Purchasers Affiliate (including the Sold Entities) and JV
Majority Participation to take actions required under any Environmental Laws
in force at the time of the omission or (ii) without limiting 13.5(f), arise
out of actions that are performed to standards that are higher than those
which are applicable to the industrial use of the Covered Property as of the
Closing Date; or 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | Environmental Losses consist of routine maintenance or repair
or the costs of improvement or upgrade of or to any building or other
structure not incurred in connection with Current Remediation Measures,
Investigated Sites Remediation Measures and Future Remediation Measures; or 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Purchaser or any Purchasers Affiliate (including the Sold
Entities) or JV Majority Participation has failed to comply in all material
respects with any of its obligations under Environmental Laws or this Section
13 to the extent such failure has materially and adversely (1) prevented
Seller and/or Purchaser to avoid or mitigate the Environmental Losses or (2)
increased the Environmental Losses; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | d. | Environmental Losses are incurred as a direct consequence of
(1) notifications, notices, or disclosures of a release of Hazardous
Substances to authorities or third parties, or environmental investigations on
the Covered Property or neighboring properties by Purchaser, any Purchasers
Affiliate (including the

     | 
---|--- 
 



90/114 construction, excavation or demolition activities on the Covered Property,
unless, in each case, under (1) or (2) above, such activities, notifications,
notices, disclosures or investigations were: 
---|--- 



     | aa. | part of Current Remediation Measures, Future Remediation
Measures or Investigated Sites Remediation Measures, or 
---|---|--- 



     | bb. | mandatory under Law, or 
---|---|--- 



     | cc. | reasonably undertaken to prevent a violation of Law or to
minimize unacceptable risks to human health or safety based on the risk-
assessment principles documented in Schedule 13.4(g), or damage to property,
or  
---|---|--- 



     | dd. | imposed by an enforceable order of the competent authority,
or 
---|---|--- 



     | ee. | in connection with operation of the Business in the normal
course, including (i) for protection of worker safety and health or (ii)
reasonably necessary in the conduct of commercial business transactions,
and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any expansion or reduction of the
facility footprint ((aa), (bb), (cc), (dd) and (ee) the "Remediation And
Future Development"). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | e. | Environmental Losses are incurred as a direct consequence of
facility closure. 
---|---|--- 



     | f. | Environmental Losses are incurred as a consequence of change
in use of the Covered Property after the Closing Date by Purchaser or
Purchasers Affiliates (including the Sold Entities) or any subsequent owner
to a more environmentally protective use, such as residential land use (which
shall, for avoidance of doubt, not include Remediation And Future
Development). 
---|---|--- 



     | g. | Purchasers Environmental Indemnity Claims result directly
from any change of Environmental Laws after the Closing Date unless related to
changes of Environmental Laws that occur during the conduct of
any Remediation Measures required under this Section 13, which shall be
governed by the Environmental Laws in effect while those Remediation Measures
are being conducted, or in the absence of applicable Laws in a particular
jurisdiction, in accordance with the standards set out in Section 13.4(g). 
---|---|--- 



   13.6 | Competing Claims 
---|--- 

Purchaser and Seller agree that any claims, irrespective of whatever kind
and of whatever basis, that Purchaser, any Purchasers Affiliate (including
the Sold Entities) and JV Majority Participations may have against Seller or
any Sellers Group Company with respect to or in connection with any
Environmental Losses relating to Existing Environmental Conditions on the
Covered Property shall be exclusively governed by this Section 13\. In
particular, any claims of the Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates (including
the Sold Entities) and JV Majority Participations pursuant to Section 24
para. 2 Federal Soil Protection Act ( _Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz_ ) and any

 



91/114  similar statutory claims shall generally be excluded. Purchaser shall ensure
that no Purchasers Affiliate (including the Sold Entities) and JV Majority
Participations will raise any respective claims against Seller and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and any Sellers Affiliates from and
against any such claims.



   13.7 | Other Remediation 
---|--- 

Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser Indemnified Parties
from and against any Environmental Losses of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties actually paid or payable and resulting from the other remediation
matter set forth on Schedule 13.7 if it becomes a Remediation Obligation. Such
Environmental Losses shall be subject to the Liability Cap.



   13.8 | Indemnification of Seller 
---|--- 

Purchaser shall indemnify ( _freistellen_ ) and hold harmless ( _schadlos
halten_ ) Seller and Sellers Affiliates from and against any and all
Environmental Losses resulting from (1) Environmental Condition on Covered
Properties caused by Purchaser after the Closing Date; and/or (2)
any violation or noncompliance of the Business with any Environmental Laws,
unless Seller is liable under Sections 10.9 or 13.

14\. Product Liability Claims and Recalls



   14.1 | Seller shall indemnify ( _freistellen_ ) and hold harmless (
_schadlos halten_ ) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any and
all Losses exceeding US$ 1,500,000.00 (in words: one million five
hundred thousand dollars) ("Product Liability Threshold") relating to (a)
Product Liability Claims and (b) any government mandated recalls or recalls of
defective Products, including, without limitation, the claims disclosed
in Schedule 14.1 (collectively, the "Product Liability, Recall and Warranty
Claims") but excluding the claims described on Schedule 14.2. For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of US$ 1,500,000.00 (in words: one
million five hundred thousand dollars) shall not count toward the Threshold
(with any amounts above the Product Liability Threshold counting toward the
Threshold). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Losses in excess of the Product
Liability Threshold shall not be subject to indemnification except to the
extent the amount of any individual claim or group of related and generally
similar claims exceeds USD 200,000.00 (for avoidance of doubt, such de minimis
threshold shall not apply to amounts that count toward the Product Liability
Threshold). 
---|--- 



   14.2 | Seller shall indemnify ( _freistellen_ ) and hold harmless (
_schadlos halten_ ) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any and
all Losses exceeding US$ 1,700,000.00 (in words: one million seven hundred
thousand dollars) relating to the claims described on Schedule 14.2 which
shall be subject to the terms of Section 14.3 to the extent it is likely to be
settled for an amount in excess of US$ 1,700,000.00 (in words: one
million seven hundred thousand dollars). For the avoidance of doubt, the
first US$ 1,700,000.00 (in words: one million seven hundred thousand dollars)
of such claim shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser and shall not count
toward the Threshold.  
---|--- 
 



92/114 managed jointly by Seller and Purchaser, each acting reasonably and in good
faith. Purchaser shall not settle any Product Liability, Recall and Warranty
Claim without the consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed by Seller. The provisions of Section 11.3 shall apply,
_mutatis mutandis_ , to claims under Section 14.1 and to Section 14.2. In the
case of government mandated recalls or recalls of defective Products Seller
will retain the right to be consulted in advance and must agree the level of
costs and contribution (if any) required to the extent attributable to Seller.
The Parties will jointly discuss and evaluate what action, if any, is to be
taken. Seller will have no obligation for service action campaigns for the
purposes of "customer care". Costs and actions will need to be agreed in
advance on a case by case basis and the costs must be reasonable. 
---|--- 

15\. Limitations



   15.1 | Save for Breaches of the Fundamental Representations or Section
10.20, Seller shall only be liable for any Losses arising from a Breach if 
---|--- 
 



     | a. | the amount of any individual claim or group of related and
generally similar claims exceeds the De Minimis Amount, provided however (i)
that if the Threshold has been exceeded, the De Minimis Amount for
any additional individual claim or group of related and generally similar
claims shall be USD 500,000.00 (in words: five hundred thousand US Dollars)
and (ii) with respect to Product Liability, Recall and Warranty Claims such
claims shall be subject to Section 14.1 in lieu of this Section 15.1(a); and 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | the aggregate amount of all such individual claims and groups
of related and generally similar claims exceeds the Threshold, in which case
Seller shall be liable for the amount exceeding the Threshold.  
---|---|--- 

However, no De Minimis Amount and Threshold shall apply for any and all of
Purchasers Environmental Indemnity Claims under Section 13\.



   15.2 | Following the Closing, the aggregate liability of Seller under
or in connection with this Agreement shall not exceed the Liability Cap,
except for (i) Breaches of the Fundamental Representations or Section 10.20,
(ii) Current Remediation Measures pursuant to Section 13 and (iii) claims
under Section 3.3(c), Section 4.4(d), Section 4.5, Section 12 or except to the
extent provided in Section 13.2(b)(bb). In no event shall the aggregate
liability of Seller for Breaches of the Fundamental Representations exceed an
amount equal to the Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt: Any liability
of the Seller under or in connection with Future Remediation Measures, except
to the extent provided in Section 13.2(b)(bb), and Investigated Site
Remediation Measures shall count towards the Liability Cap. By way of example,
if Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates has contributed USD 1,000,000.00 for
Investigated Sites Remediation Measures and USD 500,000.00 for Future
Remediation Measures under Section 13, then an amount of USD 1,500,000.00
would count towards the Liability Cap.  
---|--- 
 



93/114 to any claims of Purchaser arising as a result of intentional breaches of
contract ( _vors atzliche Vertragsverletzungen_) by Seller or fraud.  
---|--- 



   15.4 | For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses in connection
with a claim for indemnification under Sections 12, 13 and 14 (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not for purposes of determining whether a Breach
has occurred), each of the representations and warranties that contains any
qualifications as to "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect" or similar shall
be deemed to have been given as though there were no such qualifications,
and any such qualifications shall be disregarded for such purpose. 
---|--- 

16\. Survival

 



   16.1 | All claims of Purchaser against Seller arising under or in
connection with this Agreement shall be time-barred ( _Ausschlussfrist_ )

     | i. | all Claims under Section 12 shall be time-barred in
accordance with Section 12\. 
---|---|--- 
 



94/114 pursuant to Section 209 of the German Civil Code ( _B urgerliches Gesetzbuch_)
by a timely notification of Seller in accordance with Section 11.3 provided
that Purchaser commences judicial proceedings pursuant to Section 11.3 within
six (6) months after receipt by Seller of the notification. Section 203 of the
German Civil Code shall not apply unless the Parties agree otherwise in
written form. In case of an interruption ( _Neubeginn_ ), the new time
limitation shall be the longer of six (6) months or the remainder of the
initial Time Limitation. 
---|--- 
 

17\. Purchasers Representations

 

Purchaser hereby represents to Seller by way of an independent guarantee (

member, manager, equity holder, independent contractor, consultant or
otherwise) in the Business, or any business that is competitive with the
Business, as conducted on the Signing Date or on the Closing Date
("Competitive Activities"); provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit:



     | a. | Seller or any Sellers Group Company from acquiring any
Person or business that engages in Competitive Activities provided that (i)
such activities do not constitute the principal activities of the Person
or business to be acquired (based on the sales of such business during the

constitute in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the revenues of such Person
or business, Seller shall, or shall cause such Sellers Group Company to,

in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods. With regard to any Merger Control Filing or any
other filing with or approval by any Governmental Authority requested or
necessary for the completion of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, the Parties shall (i) co-operate in all respects with each other
in the preparation of any filing and in connection with any submission,
investigation or inquiry, (ii) respond without undue delay to any request from
a competent Governmental Authority for additional information pursuant to any
applicable Laws, and take all other procedural actions reasonably required in
order to obtain the Merger Control Clearances or any necessary clearance or to
cause any applicable waiting periods to commence and expire, (iii) provide
each other without undue delay with copies of any written information in
connection with any Proceeding, (iv) contact any competent Governmental
Authority only after consultation with the other Party and (v) without undue
delay inform each other in advance of the time and place of any meetings and
conferences with the competent Governmental Authority and give each other and
their respective advisors the opportunity to participate in all such meetings
and conferences. 
---|--- 



   20.2 | Nothing in this Agreement obligates Purchaser to propose, accept
or agree to, or commit to accept or agree to, or otherwise take and Seller
shall not, without Purchasers prior written consent, in Purchasers sole
discretion, discuss, accept or agree to, or commit to accept or agree to, any
measures (including, without limitation, divestitures, hold separate
arrangements, or conduct remedies) required by a Governmental Authority as a
condition of a Merger Control Clearance or of the termination or expiration
of a waiting period applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Parties under this Agreement shall not be affected.

continue a shared use of such asset for a reasonable transition period against
a reasonable cost sharing.

     | c. | Unless otherwise set forth in any Ancillary Agreements, in
respect of any tangible assets which are Sold Assets wholly or mainly used by
the Business, but which for reasonable commercial considerations Seller wishes
to, temporarily or permanently, retain or to further make use of, the Parties
shall reasonably cooperate and agree on a solution which allows Seller to
further make use of such asset, including to continue a shared use of such
