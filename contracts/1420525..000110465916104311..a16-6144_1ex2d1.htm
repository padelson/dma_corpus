import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement;

(c) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the holders of any Dissenting Share shall be entitled only to such
rights and payments as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose
such holders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, each of such holders
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.03_, and such holder thereof shall cease to have any
other rights with respect thereto. The Company shall give Purchaser (i)

Section 3.02. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall appoint an agent with the
Companys prior approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging
for the Per Share Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing Shares
(the " _Certificates_ ") (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section 3.02(g)_) or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "). Prior to or on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall,
or shall cause MidFirst to, make available to the Paying Agent immediately
available funds necessary for the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Certificates, the Uncertificated Shares and the
Company Restricted Shares pursuant to this _Article III_, other than any Per
Share Merger Consideration Purchaser elects to have paid by the Payroll
Processor pursuant to _Section 3.02(b)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Promptly
after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall send, or shall cause the Paying
Agent to send, to each holder of Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration at the Effective Time a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 3.02(g)_) or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent) for use in such exchange.

 



 

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in _Section 3.02(g)_), together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, or receipt of an "agents message"
by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Per Share Merger Consideration payable for each
Share formerly represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate
or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. To the
extent reasonably practicable, Purchaser shall have the option to fund the Per
Share Merger Consideration to be paid with respect to certain Shares that
previously represented Company Restricted Shares by funding the necessary
amounts to the payroll processor of the Company or Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates (the " _Payroll Processor_ ") for payment by the Payroll
Processor of the Per Share Merger Consideration to the applicable holders,
subject to _Section 3.03_.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the amount in immediately
available funds to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled pursuant
to, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this _Article III_.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 3.02(a)_ (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares twelve months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Purchaser or one of its Affiliates,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged its Shares for the Per
Share Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 3.02_ prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Purchaser for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares immediately prior to such
time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the property of Purchaser free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 3.02(a)_ to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights
have been perfected shall be returned to Purchaser upon demand.

 



 

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or Payroll
Processor) shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
_Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.03. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Payroll Processor, the
Surviving Corporation and Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
_Article III_ such amounts to the extent it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax
law. If the Paying Agent, the Payroll Processor, the Surviving Corporation or
Purchaser, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity and treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which the
Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may be, made
such deduction and withholding.

 



 

Section 3.04. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall be changed into
a different number of shares or a different class (including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, merger or combination,
exchange or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record
date during such period), the Per Share Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.05. _Company Restricted Shares_. Each share of Common Stock subject
to vesting, repurchase, transfer or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any
of the Company Benefit Plans (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and
become free of such restrictions and any repurchase right shall lapse, as of
the Effective Time and, at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to each
such Company Restricted Share provided in _Section 3.01_ and _Section 3.02_
and subject to the terms and conditions applicable to Shares under this
Agreement.

Person as an independent contractor rather than as an employee or as a result

current employer of any such Company Employee, in each case, to the extent
such material violation relates (1) to the right of any such Company Employee
to be employed by the Company or the Bank or (2) to the knowledge or use of
trade secrets or proprietary information in connection with such Persons
employment with the Company or the Bank.

 



 

(h) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has no Knowledge that any
current employee of the Company or the Bank with an annual base salary
exceeding $75,000 in the aggregate presently intends to terminate or is

(i) Other than pursuant to a Contract set forth on _Section 4.21(i)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the employment of each Company Employee and the
engagement of each independent contractor of the Company or the Bank are
terminable at will by the Company or the Bank, as applicable, without any

employees, retirees, former employees, dependents, spouses, directors,
independent contractors, or other beneficiaries are eligible to participate or
with respect to which the Company, the Bank or any ERISA Affiliate has or may
have any obligation or Liability (collectively, whether or not material, the "
_Company Benefit Plans_ "). _Section 4.22(a)_ of Company Disclosure Schedule
has a complete and accurate list of all such Company Benefit Plans. No Company
Benefit Plan is subject to any Laws other than those of the United States and
any state, county, or municipality in the United States.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Purchaser (i) all trust agreements or
other funding arrangements for all Company Benefit Plans, (ii) all
determination letters, opinion letters, information letters or advisory
opinions issued by the United States Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), the
United States Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
during this calendar year or any of the preceding three calendar years with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) annual reports or returns, audited
or unaudited financial statements, actuarial reports and valuations required
to be prepared for any Company Benefit Plan for the current plan year and the
preceding plan year, (iv) the most recent summary plan descriptions and any
material modifications thereto for any Company Benefit Plan required to have a
summary plan description and (v) all material correspondence with any
Governmental Entity regarding any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan is and has been maintained in all material
respects in accordance with the terms and the applicable requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code, ERISA, and any other applicable Law. Each Company
Benefit Plan that is intended to be

 



      
 

 



 

qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is so qualified
and has received a favorable determination letter, or for a prototype plan,
opinion letter, from the IRS that is still in effect, applies to the Company
Benefit Plan, and on which the Company or the Bank, as applicable, is entitled
to rely.

 



 

(d) There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the Company
Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and no action, proceeding, prosecution,
inquiry, hearing or investigation has been commenced with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(e) Neither the Company nor the Bank has engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited
transaction" (described in Internal Revenue Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA
Section 406), and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no "party in interest" (as
defined in ERISA Section 3(14)) or "disqualified person" (as defined in
Internal Revenue Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any Company Benefit Plan has
engaged in any such nonexempt "prohibited transaction." All assets of any
Company Benefit Plan consist of cash or actively traded securities.

 



 

(f) None of the Company, the Bank or any ERISA Affiliate has at any time been
a party to or maintained, sponsored, contributed to or has been obligated to
contribute to, or had any liability with respect to: (i) any plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA, including a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA
Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3)); (ii) a "multiple employer plan" (within the
meaning of ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code); (iii) a self-funded health or
welfare benefit plan; (iv) any voluntary employees beneficiary association
(within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code); or (v)
an arrangement that is not either exempt from, or in compliance with, Section
409A of the Internal Revenue Code or that provides for indemnification for or
gross-up of any taxes thereunder.

 



 

(g) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a health plan is in compliance with the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the " _2010 Health Care Law_ "). The
operation of each such plan has not resulted in the incurrence of any penalty
to the Company or the Bank pursuant to the 2010 Health Care Law. If the
Company or the Bank is an Applicable Large Employer (as defined in the 2010
Health Care Law), the Company or the Bank, as applicable, has offered all
full-time employees (within the meaning of the 2010 Health Care Law) the
ability to elect minimum essential coverage that provides minimum value for
themselves and their dependents, such that there will not be any liability or
excise tax under Section 4980H(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the Company
or the Bank is an Applicable Large Employer, there will not be any penalty or
excise tax assessed against the Company or the Bank, as applicable, under
4980H(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. There is nothing that would create a
reporting obligation or excise tax under 4980D of the Internal Revenue Code.
Neither the Company, the Bank, nor any ERISA Affiliate has or could reasonably
be expected to have any liability for taxes under Sections 4975 through 4980
or Sections 4980A through 4980I of the Internal Revenue Code.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor the Bank has any Liability for health or life
benefits for any period extending beyond the termination of any individuals
employment or period of service, other than as required under Section 4980B of
the Internal Revenue Code or similar state health care continuation laws.

 



       
 

 



 

(i) All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Company Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on
the Books and Records of the Company and the Bank.

 



 

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit
to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of the Company or
the Bank, or result in any (i) requirement to fund any benefits or set aside
benefits in a trust (including a rabbi trust) or (ii) limitation on the right
of the Company or the Bank to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion
of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or the Bank in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof
or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will
be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code. _Section 4.22(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth accurate and complete data with respect to each individual who has
a contractual right to severance pay or pay or benefits triggered by or
following a change in control and the amounts potentially payable to each such
individual in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) or as a result of a termination of
employment or service, taking into account any contractual provisions relating
to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. No Company Benefit Plan provides
for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Sections 409A or 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code, or otherwise.

neither the Company nor the Bank has received any written notice of
cancellation or non-renewal of any such policies, nor is the termination of

Company, threatened material claims under any such policy. Since January 1,
2013, neither the Company nor the Bank has been refused any insurance with
respect to its Assets or operations by any insurance carrier to which it has
applied for any such insurance or with which it has carried insurance.

or restriction is to be taken or implemented), (x) individually or in the

limiting the scope of the foregoing, the receiving Party shall, to the extent

Adverse Recommendation Change. The obligation of the Company to hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting and to solicit proxies therefor shall not be
affected by any Acquisition Proposal or other event or circumstance (
_provided_ that if the Company Board has withdrawn the Company Board
Recommendation in compliance with _Section 7.05_, such solicitation need not
request proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement) and the Company
agrees that it will not submit any Acquisition Proposal to its stockholders
for a vote unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Any adjournment, delay or postponement of the Company Stockholder Meeting
shall require the prior written consent of Purchaser; _provided_ that (i) the
Company shall be permitted to (and shall do so if requested by Purchaser)
adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (A) after
consultation with Purchaser, for a period not to exceed 15 days if as of the
time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Company Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting or (B) after
consultation with Purchaser, if the Company Board has determined in good faith
based on the advice of outside counsel that it is necessary to ensure that any
legally required supplement or amendment to the Company Proxy Statement is
provided to the stockholders of the Company with adequate time to review and
(ii) Purchaser may require the Company to adjourn, delay or postpone the
Company Stockholder Meeting once for a period not to exceed 30 calendar days
(but prior to the date that is two Business Days prior to the Outside Date) to
solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Requisite Stockholder
Approval. Once the Company has established a record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, unless required to do so by applicable
Law or the Companys organizational documents. Without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other
than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted
on by the Companys stockholders in connection with the adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholder Meeting.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding (i) any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the
public proposal or announcement or other submission to the Company or any of
its Representatives of an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, the obligations of the Company under this _Section 7.04_
shall continue in full force and effect.

 



 

Section 7.05. _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause the Bank and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, propose
or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information)
any inquiries or the submission of any proposal that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions (other
than as necessary to ascertain facts or clarify terms with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section
7.05_) or negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any non-public
information relating to, afford access to the business, Books and Records and
Assets of the Company or the Bank in connection with, or otherwise cooperate
with any Person with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing;
_provided_ that if in response to an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof and at any time prior to the
time that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained (but not thereafter)
in circumstances not involving a breach of this _Section 7.05_, the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor)

 



      
 

 



 

that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal and with respect to which the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may at
any time prior to the time that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained
(but in no event after such time), furnish information with respect to the
Company and the Bank to, or enter into discussions with, the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives; _provided_ that (1) at
least 24 hours prior to furnishing any such information to, or entering into
discussions with, such Person, Purchaser receives written notice from the
Company of the identity of such Person and of the Companys intention to
furnish information to, or enter into discussions with, such Person, and the
Company enters into with such Person a confidentiality agreement in a form
that is no less favorable in all material respects to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (2) the Company concurrently furnishes all such
information provided to such Person to Purchaser (to the extent such
information has not been previously furnished or made available by the Company
to Purchaser and Purchasers Representatives). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not provide any commercially sensitive non-public
information to any competitor, except in a manner consistent with the
Companys past practices in dealing with the disclosure of such information in
the context of considering Acquisition Proposals prior to the date hereof. The
Company shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the provisions of
this _Section 7.05(a)_. The Company shall provide Purchaser with an accurate
and complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to
this S _ection 7.05(a)_ within 24 hours of the execution thereof.

 



 

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 7.05_, the Company shall as promptly as practicable, and in any
event no later than 24 hours after receipt thereof, advise Purchaser, orally
and in writing, of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer
that expressly contemplates or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Purchaser, indicate the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or
offer, the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal, proposal
or offer (including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such
terms and conditions) or the nature of any inquiries or other contacts, and
provide to Purchaser copies of any written materials received from or on
behalf of such Person relating to such inquiry, proposal or offer (including
any subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions),
and thereafter the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
advise Purchaser of any related material developments, discussions and
negotiations on a reasonably current basis, including any subsequent amendment
or other modification to such terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information provided pursuant to this _Section 7.05(b)_.

 



 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 7.05(d)_, _Section 7.05(e)_ or
_Section 7.05(f)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
(i) (1) withhold, fail to make or include in (or remove from) the Company
Proxy Statement, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, fail to make or include in (or remove from) the Company Proxy
Statement), in each case in a manner adverse to Purchaser, the Company Board
Recommendation or (2) adopt, approve, recommend, submit to the Companys
stockholders or declare advisable (or resolve, determine or propose to adopt,
approve,

 



      
 

 



 

recommend, submit to the Companys stockholders or declare advisable) any
Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred
to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) approve any
transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under,
Section 203 of the DGCL or (iii) adopt, approve, recommend, submit to
Companys stockholders or declare advisable (or resolve, determine or propose
to adopt, approve, recommend, submit to the Companys stockholders or declare
advisable), or allow the Company or the Bank to execute or enter into, any
Contract, term sheet, letter of intent, agreement in principle or other
similar instrument constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could
be reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or requiring or
reasonably likely to cause the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate, or that would otherwise prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the transactions contemplated hereby, other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section 7.05(a)_ entered into in compliance with
_Section 7.05(a)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.05_, at any
time prior to the time that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained
(but not thereafter), the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified
Agreement, in each case if, and only if, (i) the Company is not in material
breach of this _Section 7.05_, (ii) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iii) the
Company has given Purchaser written notice of the Company Boards intention to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to
enter into a Specified Agreement, including all information required to be
provided to Purchaser under _Section 7.05(b)_, at least five Business Days
prior to making any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement (a " _Change of
Recommendation Notice_ "), (iv) if not based on an Intervening Event pursuant
to _Section 7.05(e)_ the decision to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change shall be in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or with the
Companys intent to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Company
shall have complied with clauses (1) through (4) as follows: (1) prior to
giving effect to clauses (2) through (4), the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, (2) the Company shall have provided to Purchaser in writing the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all
material documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance with
this _Section 7.05_, (3) the Company shall have given Purchaser a five-
Business Day period following Purchasers receipt of the Change of
Recommendation Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make other proposals and shall have negotiated in good faith with Purchaser
(and caused its Representatives to negotiate with Purchaser) with respect to
such proposed revisions or other proposals, if any, so that the Acquisition
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and (4) after
considering the results of negotiations with Purchaser and taking into account
the proposals made by Purchaser, if any, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to make the Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into

 



       
 

 



 

a Specified Agreement would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. For clarity, the provisions of this
_Section 7.05(d)_ shall also apply to any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal or any successive Acquisition Proposals, except that the
five-Business Day notice period shall be replaced with a three-Business Day
notice period. Neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be permitted to
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, unless in each case,
in connection therewith, the Company Board effects a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the time that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is
obtained, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
based on an Intervening Event, if and only if: (i) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; (ii) Purchaser shall have received from the Company
written notice thereof at least five Business Days prior to making any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, describing the Intervening Event and the
reasons for taking such action in reasonable detail, and copies of any
correspondence and additional written materials sent or received that relate
to such Intervening Event (as well as written summaries of any oral
communications addressing such matters); (iii) during the five Business Day
period provided in the foregoing clause (ii), the Company shall have given
Purchaser a five-Business Day period following Purchasers receipt of the
notice described in the foregoing clause (ii) to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement or make other proposals and shall have negotiated in
good faith with Purchaser (and caused its Representatives to negotiate with
Purchaser) with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposals, if any,
that would obviate the need to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
and (iv) after considering the results of negotiations with Purchaser and
taking into account the proposals made by Purchaser, if any, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith that the failure to make the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board from
complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is
consistent with this _Section 7.05_; _provided_ that any such action taken or
statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (except that a "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or similar
communication shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change).

 



 

(g) To the extent not already done, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Bank and the Companys and the Banks respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, and promptly (but in no event later than 48 hours
following the execution of this Agreement) request and use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the return from all such Persons, or cause the destruction,
of all copies of confidential

 



      
 

 



 

information previously provided to such Persons by or on behalf of the
Company, the Bank or their respective Representatives (and all analyses and
other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Persons that contain, reflect
or analyze such confidential information).

 



 

Section 7.06. _Employee Benefits and Contracts_.

 



 

(a) For a period of at least twelve months following the Effective Time,
except as contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser shall provide generally to
officers and employees (as a group) who are actively employed by the Company
and the Bank on the Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") while employed by
the Surviving Corporation or the Bank following the Closing Date with (1)
annual base salaries or base wage rates no less than those in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, (2) annual and quarterly bonus
opportunities no less than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (3) other employee benefits under Employee Benefit Plans, on terms and
conditions which when taken as a whole are substantially comparable to either
(i) those currently, generally provided by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to
their similarly situated officers and employees or (ii) those provided under
the Company Benefit Plans, other than any equity compensation plans. Only for
purposes of (1) eligibility to participate in and vesting under Purchasers
Employee Benefit Plans, and (2) credit for years of service with the Company
for vacation and sick leave accrual, and for no other purpose, the service of
the Covered Employees prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service
with Purchaser or a Subsidiary of Purchaser participating in such employee
benefit plans, to the same extent that such service was recognized by the
Company or the Bank for purposes of a similar benefit plan; _provided_ that
such recognition of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of
a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service or (ii) apply
for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (A) under which similarly-
situated employees of Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser do not receive
credit for prior service, (B) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with
respect to level of benefits or participation, or (C) for purposes of retiree
medical benefits or level of benefits under a defined benefit pension plan.
Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to cause each employee (and
employees eligible dependents) who participated in the Companys medical
benefits on the closing date to be eligible to participate in Purchasers
medical benefits immediately following the Closing.

 



 

(b) If requested by Purchaser in a writing delivered to the Company following
the date hereof and at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company and the Bank shall take all necessary action (including the adoption
of resolutions and plan amendments and the delivery of any required notices)
to terminate, effective as of no later than the day before the Closing Date,
any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to constitute a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) (a "
_401(k) Plan_"). The Company shall provide Purchaser with a copy of the
resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared to
effectuate the termination of the 401(k) Plans in advance and give Purchaser a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents (which comments shall be
considered in good faith), and prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Purchaser with the final documentation evidencing that the 401(k)
Plans have been terminated.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.06_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no Covered Employee, current or former employee
or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose
as a third party beneficiary of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement, other than as provided in _Section 7.07_. The terms of this
Agreement do not: (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or
any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or
limit the ability of Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser (including,
after the Closing Date, the Company and the Bank) to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit
or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date;
or (iii) confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant, any right to employment or continued employment or continued
service with Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser (including, following
the Closing Date, the Company and Purchaser), or constitute or create an
employment agreement with any employee.

 



 

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of the
individuals set forth on _Exhibit D_ hereto to enter into a 2016 Retention
Pool and Long Term Incentive Award Agreement with MidFirst promptly and in any
event prior to the Closing, in the last form proposed by Purchaser prior to
the date hereof.

 



 

(e) No more than two Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
update _Section 4.21(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule so that it is current as
of such date.

 



 

Section 7.07. _Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless and advance expenses to, each of the present and former officers and
directors of the Company and the Bank (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to
the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other Applicable Law or
provided under the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the
Banks articles of association and bylaws and any Contracts providing rights
to indemnification or advancement of expenses of any Indemnified Person, in
each case as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that such
indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under applicable Law; _provided further_ that any Indemnified Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking in a form satisfactory to
Purchaser to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall either (i) continue to maintain in effect for six years
after the Effective Time the Companys and the Banks directors and officers
insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "
_D andO Insurance_") in place as of the date hereof or (ii) purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period, in each case with respect to any claim
related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as those contained in the DandO Insurance policies in effect as of the date
hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall Purchaser be required to expend for
such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of
200% of the amount per annum the Company or the Bank respectively paid in its
last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth on _Section 7.07(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Purchaser
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.07_.

 



 

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 7.07_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation, articles of association or bylaws of the Company or the Bank,
under the DGCL or any other applicable Law, or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or the Bank. These rights shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, the rights of indemnification and advancement of
expenses of any Indemnified Person hereby in respect of any proceeding
commenced within the six-year period set forth in this _Section 7.07_ shall
continue until the final disposition of such proceeding.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section 7.07_ shall require Purchaser, the Company or the Bank (or any
of their respective successors or assigns) to provide, obtain or maintain any
directors or officers liability insurance policies or coverage, or any
"tail" insurance policies or coverage, in contravention of applicable Law or
Order (including, for the avoidance of doubt, applicable federal banking Laws
or Orders) or informal requirements and requests by any regulatory body. It is
understood and agreed that such certificates of incorporation, articles of
association, bylaws and agreements or other documents, as applicable, may be
amended following Closing to comply with the foregoing.

 



 

Section 7.08. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and
Purchaser shall promptly notify the other of:

 



 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(b) any Litigation commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company and the Bank or
Purchaser and any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, (i) that, if
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to any Section of this Agreement or (ii) that relate to
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

 



 

(c) any inaccuracy in any material respect of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof; _provided_
that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of such Party set forth herein;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) any failure of that Party to comply in any material respect with or
satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; and

 



 

(e) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that has a materially adverse
impact on the likelihood that all of the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ will be satisfied prior to the Outside Date;

 



 

 _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.08_
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
Party receiving such notice and the failure to give such notice shall not
separately constitute a failure of any condition in _Article VIII_ or a basis
to terminate this Agreement unless the underlying fact, event or circumstance
would independently result in such failure or provide such basis. The terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
provided pursuant to this _Section 7.08_.

 



 

Section 7.09. _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no
event more than 20 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the
date hereof, the Company will furnish to Purchaser: (i) unaudited consolidated
financial statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and
stockholders equity) of the Company or the Bank (to the extent available) as
of and for such month then ended (subject to normal quarter-end adjustments),
(ii) to the extent available, internal management reports showing actual
financial performance against plan and previous period and (iii) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, any reports provided to the Company Board or any
committee thereof relating to the financial performance and risk management of
the Company or the Bank.

 



 

Section 7.10. _Press Releases_. The initial press release concerning this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press
release to be reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Purchaser. Following
such initial press release, Purchaser and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any additional press release, making any other public
statement or scheduling any press conference, conference call or meeting with
investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by applicable Law or any
listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or
association, shall not issue any such press release, make any such other
public statement or schedule any such press conference, conference call or
meeting before such consultation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.10_ shall not apply to any release
or public statement made or proposed to be made by the Company in compliance
with _Section 7.04_ or _Section 7.05_ with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger of the transactions contemplated hereby (or by Purchaser in response
thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 7.10 shall not apply to
any press release or other public statement made by the Company that is made
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and does not
specifically relate to the signing of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 7.11. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Purchaser the
opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of
any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Purchasers prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



 

Section 7.12. _Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company Board shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, use its reasonable best efforts (a) to
take all actions necessary to ensure that no Takeover Provision is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Stockholder Voting Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger, and (b) if
any Takeover Provision becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Stockholder
Voting Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to take
all actions necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Voting Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Provision on Purchaser and
Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Stockholder Voting Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

Section 7.13. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such shares) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 7.14. _Stock Exchange Delisting; Securities Act Deregistration_. Prior

hereof.

Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.17. _Company S-1_. Following the date hereof, the Company shall not,
and shall cause its Representatives not to, amend or update the Company S-1,
issue any securities pursuant to the Company S-1 or take any other action with
respect to the Company S-1 other than a withdrawal of the Company S-1.

 



 

Section 7.18. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name

 



      
 

 



 

and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the
Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right,

specified date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be
true and correct in the manner set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through

after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company
(unless otherwise provided below)):

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Purchaser;

competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable Order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) by either the Company or Purchaser, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Outside Date_ ") unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such
date shall be due to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such Party set
forth in this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by either the Company or Purchaser ( _provided_ that the terminating Party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a
termination by Purchaser, or on the part of Purchaser or Merger Sub, in the
case of a termination by the Company, which breach, either individually or in
the aggregate with other breaches by such Party, would result in, if occurring
or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.02_ or _8.03_ , as the case may be, and which is not
cured within the earlier of (i) 30 days following written notice to the Party

satisfying the requirements of the applicable clause and the Company
Stockholder Meeting is held on such date, the Company Stockholder Meeting with
respect to which there shall be a termination right as described in this
_Section 9.01(e)_ shall be the Company Stockholder Meeting giving effect to
such adjournment; provided further that the Company shall have no right to
terminate pursuant to this _Section 9.01(e)_ if the Company is in breach of
_Section 7.04_;

 



 

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to the time that the Requisite
Stockholder Approval is obtained (and not thereafter), if (i) the Company is
not in material breach of any of the terms of _Section 7.05_, (ii) the
Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
compliance in all material respects with the terms of this Agreement,
including _Section 7.05(d)_, in order to enter into a binding, written

accordance with the terms, and at the time, specified therein and (iv) the
Company shall have entered into the Specified Agreement substantially
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.01(f)_; or

 



 

(g) by Purchaser if (i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have
occurred, (ii) at any time after public announcement of an Acquisition
Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal otherwise becoming public, the Company
Board, prior to the time that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained
(and not thereafter), shall have failed to reaffirm the

 



       
 

 



 

Company Board Recommendation prior to the earlier of (1) ten Business Days
following receipt of any written request to do so from Purchaser and (2) the
close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Company
Stockholder Meeting, (iii) the Company shall have materially breached its
obligations under Section _7.04_ or _7.05_ or (iv) the Company or the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) shall publicly announce its intention to do
any of the foregoing.

Section 9.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Purchaser as provided in _Section 9.01_,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of the
Company, Purchaser, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the
officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature
whatsoever under this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except that the Confidentiality Agreement and

Agreement, and (ii) neither the Company nor Purchaser shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or knowing
and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.03. _Termination Fee_.

9.01(g)_, (ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(f)_ or (iii) Purchaser
or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)_ or _Section 9.01(e)_ in either
case at any time at which Purchaser was entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(g)_, then the Company shall pay to Purchaser in
immediately available funds $4,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), in the
case of a termination by Purchaser, within two Business Day after such
termination and, in the case of a termination by the Company, immediately
before and as a condition to such termination.

if this Agreement is terminated by (i) Purchaser pursuant to _Section
9.01(d)_, (ii) Purchaser or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_ or
(iii) Purchaser or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)_ at any time at
which Purchaser was entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.01(d)_ or _Section 9.01(e)_, then the Company shall promptly, and in no
event later than two days after being notified of such amounts by Purchaser,
pay to Purchaser in immediately available funds an amount equal to all of the
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $1,000,000.

 



 

(c) Except if the Termination Fee is paid as provided in _Section 9.03(a)_,
if (i) this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser or the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.01(c)_ or _Section 9.01(e)_, or by Purchaser pursuant to _Section

agreement with respect to or recommended to its stockholders an Acquisition
Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated ( _provided_
that for purposes of this _Section 9.03(b)_, each reference to "15%" in the

funds, concurrently with the occurrence of the applicable event described in
clause (iii) the Termination Fee (less the amount of any expense reimbursement
paid by the Company previously to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.03(b)_).

 



 

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Purchaser and Merger Sub would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any
amount due to Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 9.03_, it shall also pay
any costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser or Merger Sub in connection with
a legal action to enforce this Agreement, together with interest on the amount
of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate
of interest reported from time to time in _The Wall Street Journal_ ,
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over three
hundred sixty from the date such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid
to (but excluding) the payment date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that the
Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this
Section 9.03, the Termination Fee shall be Purchasers and Merger Subs sole
and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement.

accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the
conflict of laws principles thereof that would require the application of the
Law of any other jurisdiction; _provided_ , that the laws of the State of
Oklahoma shall apply to the extent mandatorily applicable with respect to the
Subsequent Merger and the United States Code shall apply to the extent
mandatorily applicable with respect to the Bank Merger.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any
Party or any of its Affiliates or against any Party or any of its Affiliates)
shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not
have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other
Delaware state court, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on
such Party as provided in _Section 10.06_ shall be deemed effective service
of process on such Party. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,

HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF

 



      
 

 



 

THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.07_.

 



 

Section 10.08. _Specific Performance_ (a) . The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement

breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the
Merger), this being in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby further waives (a)

be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

Section 10.09. _Counterparts; Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Executed

AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED
IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PURCHASER AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY NOR ANY OF
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES MAKES OR HAS RELIED ON ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS,

RELIANCE ON ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, STATEMENTS, INFORMATION OR
INDUCEMENTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ON THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
STATEMENTS OR OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY
OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO
THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING, AND WAIVES ANY
CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION RELATING THERETO.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.11. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which
is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable. Upon such a determination of unenforceability, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
